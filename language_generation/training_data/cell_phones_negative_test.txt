Buyer Beware -- Manufacturer does NOT stand behind it.  Please, please do not buy this phone.  The manufacturer will NOT stand behind it.  I purchased it new on March 2017 and it worked fine until January 2018.  I was unable to make calls or text due to the phone getting stuck in airplane mode.  Even though I would turn off airplane mode and it appeared off in settings, the phone thought it was still in airplane mode.  I did everything I could to rectify even resetting to factory settings (which means losing all pics and data BTW).  Finally called manufacturer who agreed that this was a known problem with their phone.  They offered 2 solutions: (1) put a 399.99 hold on my credit call while they send me out a REFURBISHED phone-- not NEW-- or (2) send back my phone for repair meaning no access to a phone for 2 weeks.  She said if they could not repair then I would get a REFURBISHED replacement phone.  When you pay 426.99 for a brand new phone, you would hope that the manufacturer would offer a replacement NEW phone or a refund not a REFURBISHED phone.  Please save yourself from the grief and frustration that I went through over this phone and choose another.
Defective unit. GPS does not work.  Defective. GPS stopped working a few days after I could not return it.
Not US Region model!!!  My HTC One was sold by "Masterdeals" and came as a new (unopened) phone, but I faced something that I never expected 2 days ago when I contacted HTC USA support since I could not update my phone to Android 4.4. The phone I have had Spanish region software in it although it was advertised as a US unlocked device. Now, I am stuck with a phone that does not have US software in it, so the fate for the next upgrades are totally unknown. If I want to get the updates, then I have to void my warranty and change the ROM and root my device, which I definitely don't want before my warranty ends. Therefore, please AVOID this seller for any cost. I never thought that I would face with this kind of thing with a legitimate purchase from Amazon.com.
I ordered this and received an AT&T phone which is functionally useless on the T-mobile network as it cannot send or receive group texts or images.  This is a known issue and the ways to get around it require a great deal of technical knowledge and can kill the phone entirely if you make a mistake.  T-mobile users especially should stay away.
horrible, horrible phone. freezes occasionally and the battery has to be removed to restart.
Volume buttons don't work. Battery drains fast
A month after, the screen needs to replace. Waste
Fraud.  Phone was neither new nor functional!  FRAUD.  Firstly, the phone was not new; it was USED.  Even worse, it DIDN'T WORK!.  The phone never charged properly.  I took it to a national phone repair chain and they found corrosion by the charge port.  Having removed the corrosion, the phone started to charge enough for them to turn it on, only for us to the the blue screen of death.  So this phone was neither new nor functional!  Complete waste of money!  Don't make the same mistake I did!
This product Bricked on me after 4 months......I thought I bought it brand new so I'm just out of all of my money.
THIS PHONE SUCKS!  This phone absolutely sucks, forget all the hype, it's the biggest piece of junk that has ever existed. I'm switching from a Nexus 5 that survived 2 years and never had an issue (my girlfriend now uses it), and I wish I hadn't "upgraded."  First issue: it almost forces you to use the thumbprint which doesn't work when it's wet. Yes it has a backup pin, but it sometimes doesn't give you the option if you get the thumb "wrong" enough times. About a month ago I was trying to find a friends house and needed to call/text him to get the house #; I was outside and it was pouring rain. Of course the thumb print doesn't work, and it never gave me the option to put in my pin, so what's it do? It locks me out for 30 seconds. Guess what? You only have 1 try to get it right the next time, even though I dried it and myself the best I could under an awning, try 2 doesn't work, so it locks me out for 1 minute, repeat, but this time it locks me out for 5 minutes, repeat, IT LOCKS ME OUT WHEN I'M IN THE RAIN TRYING TO FIND MY FRIENDS HOUSE FOR 30 MINUTES! LUCKILY, I finally got it to work after being outside for an hour in the pouring rain fiddling with this useless thing.  Second Issue: My camera lens randomly smashed. I can narrow it down to a 30 minute window when it happened and there was no hard impact that would have done it. I've read other comments of people with similar issues; the lens is very cheaply made.  Third Issue: The text/messaging notification takes up about 30% of the screen when you get a text and there's NO WAY TO TURN IT OFF! No matter what, if you're using your phone and someone sends you a text/skype/whatsapp, a third of your screen gets covered by it. On the nexus, it's a little line across the top that doesn't get in the way of what you were already doing, like reading an article/e-mail or playing a game. You also don't just get one on the first unread message, they just keep coming and coming and coming.  Fourth Issue: This is the one that put me over the edge and made me write this review. Even though this phone is water resistant, I treat it like every other phone that I've ever had and act like it's not. About 2 weeks ago it started randomly not charging saying that it detected moisture in the port; it hasn't been in the rain or any other situation where it's gotten wet! It decides to do this,  and sometimes after rebooting it's worked, sometimes I just let it sit on the charger and come back hours later and it's worked; it's always fixed itself in the past. However, last night it started giving me this message. I've waited and waited and waited, and restarted and restarted and restarted, and IT'S STILL NOT CHARGING AND GIVING ME THE MESSAGE!!!! I went so far as to turn it off and use a hair dryer on the port, and tried again, IT STILL DOESN'T WORK.  THIS PHONE SUCKS!
Screen cracked by itself!!  Own this s7 edge for less than week,  screen just cracked right where edge begin, there was no impact, it was on table last I saw it it was fine, then picked up and see crack I owned 10 phones, never had cracked screen issues, this is first
It's working but I'm not happy with it  So the truth is that it is working I bought a used one. But it's fully with dents and scratches the screen is ok but everything around is bad bad. And it takes very long to charge and the battery goes out fast. If I wold have extra time I wold send it back but I don't have the time for it. I can't stay without a phone any more so I'm not sending it back but really I need a refund. Or at least for the half price refund. So if I will get back a refund or something I will update my review and will let you know my experience,
The phone is not working...
I bougth an iPhone 5s and the details said that, It was Brand new, But they iPhone have some defects.  When they said that was 100% New .If Will know that It was a terrible buy i Will rather spend my Money in other options.
Very disappointed, I brought this for my husband for an early father day gift, and it would not take his Sim card, even though it said it was universal,.. It was an HTC phone and it was not mention in the discription.
Not Unlocked  The iPhones were NOT unlocked and did not work.  I had to return them.
terrible buy.  The phones charger port was not working properly when I got it..the battery also dies in about two hours...terrible buy..no wonder there's no warranty on this piece of junk
Did not work. Died the next.
Bad phone had tones of problems couldn't get my money back
don't like it it stop working after 4 month of use
worst service ever  horrible service phone does not work is locked
i love it i can't complain its clean and has less scratches  i love it thanks much and i love doing business with you!!!
Sucked, gets hot and won't stay charged if you take it off the charger! Won't be getting another phone from off here!
BAD UNIT. Overall decent phone if you can find one that works.  The camera sensor came in messed up. Alot of these refurb phones are not fixed properly.
very bad  not unlocked. in Venezuela does not work with any telephone company. and the seller has not solved anything. when I got it set up and tested with wireless internet (worked very well), when delivered as it was for my mother's birthday did not recognize any simcard from the phone companies have. asks for a network unlock pin. THE PHONE IS BLOCKED
Don't expect to have room for apps.  When I ordered I didn't realize that purchasing external storage wouldn't work for most apps; especially the ones already installed.  I just got it and am constantly getting a *storage is almost full* warning.  I would not order again and unfortunately it is past the return date.  I don't feel that the way it was advertised was very clear for anyone not tech savvy that there would be practically 0 storage.  I rarely but a new phone and only upgraded so that it would work with fit bit; otherwise I would go back to my J3.  Pretty bummed overall...
Not just Unlocked GSM phone, it's an AT&T phone and doesn't work with anything else  I love S6, we have two already but...I returned this one.  I was under the impression that I'm buying just an Unlocked GSM Galaxy S6 but this came pre-configured for AT&T.  I got it working with H2O, which was my goal all along, and I was initially going to overlook all the AT&T bloatware but it wouldn't let me update Android.  Somehow it is hooked into AT&T update and it kept telling me that I'm up to date even though the S6 came with Android 5.11, at least 3 years out of date.  There's no way to get H2O to update the software.  I feel Amazon misrepresented what this phone is.  This is an AT&T phone, not an Unlocked GSM phone.
I am very upset because the phone I received was not dual sim and was not unlocked.
Buyer be ware ! listed as unlocked : wrong. Found out it must be activated via a (north/central/south)  American carrier. AND a call must be made of duration greater than 5 minutes from this region. This means you cannot buy it and start using it in india, australia, japan, china, europe, etc.... All those reviewers who gave it a 5 star, operated the phone in the americas or caribbean. you have to break the box seal to get at the user manual to find out that the device only accepts Micro Sims. So you cannot transfer a regular sim from your old phone (unless you want to gamble and try to cut the old sim card down to size). I had originally contacted the seller and received assurance that it was an international phone. Amazon agreed to refund my full cost (including shipping)
I purchased a phone listed as NEW. It came convincingly packaged in an Apple box with accessories.  When the camera quit working the person who repaired it told us (and showed us) that it had been poorly refurbished. Buyer beware.
Good phone UNTIL it got a constant malfunction with T-mobile (antenna is not working often). Went to T-mobile with this and got this feed back. Disappointed...
sorry I'm very upset  The phone was good the first 2 weeks but after that I can't turn the phone on
sent me a remanufactured phone  I had problems with the shipping company and to date I receive it today, I get a mobile repowered, I think of very low reputation make this scam
very disappointed, cell not get full  very disappointed , cell not get full , I miss the sim tray , and my biggest problem living in Ecuador
BE ADVISED THIS 'NEW' 16GB (HA!) PHONE COMES WITH 5 GB OF UN-REMOVABLE ATT BATTERY DRAINING BLOATWARE AND IS USED/REFURBISHED  Anyone considering purchasing this based on the (generic no carrier logo) images shown should be advised the 16gb phone is actually an unlocked att phone (stamped on back plate) and is loaded with un-removable att bloatware that takes up almost 5 gb of memory. After accidentally shattering the screen on my 5 month old T-mobile Galaxy S3, I SPECIFICALLY (foolishly) went with this seller as opposed to another (cheaper) seller because I  DID NOT WANT an ATT phone, having dealt with their un-removable bloatware in past eating up huge chunks of memory and batter power; these programs can be 'force stopped.turned off, but restart on next powering on..  I now have basically spent $140 (incl tax) on what is essentially an 8gb phone loaded with battery draining att unneeded, unwanted, useless programs that I absolutely hate.  Classic case of buyer beware. -.-  Edited to add: Additionally, in examining the phone, although it was sold as 'new', it is clearly USED/REFURBISHED. The lens over the camera is chipped on one side and scratched, and the earphone jack has clearly been used numerous times, as has the usb/charging port at the bottom.
This seller does not honor warranties!!!  This seller does not honor warranties. Do not buy from Wireless Electronics USA. This phone did not make it to a year and suddenly stopped working. Seller will not honor the apple warranty.
was not at all satisfied with the device because it came wit an obvious software problem, the notification bar that drops down keeps dropping without me actually touching the phone, its a real distraction when you are trying to use the device, and this device was guaranteed brand new, since i am new to shopping on amazon i do hope this does not persist in the future
BEWARE BUYERS! USED PRODUCT  Truth is, phone works well, but it came with a preloaded video, disgusting and degenerate, not even porn, worse, unhuman things, some people may find it funny, i don't know, but i bought a new unused phone and instead, i received a loaded phone, with disgusting videos, and i wonder everyday what would had happened if the phone was a gift for my daughter and she saw that disgusting video of nude people doing disgasting things i should not explain on this review. And i am not speaking about pornography, or sexuality, its a unhumain video.
not good.  I placed an order for the new. But you gave me the second-hand. Reputation is so bad, it is difficult to have cooperation.
no headphones  In the picture theres headphones but when i recieved my order no headphones.
BEWARE as fragile as glass  Just to warn other customers, I am terrible disappointed in the quality of this phone. It dropped only 2 feet, and all the screen has a big crack on it now. Very surprised with this lack of quality from a Samsung phone. I have own a Captivate and an HTC, and they have been more durable than this. This lack of quality really feels like a joke from Samsung on the customers, paying over $300 for a phone which the screen easily breaks like that? I haven't had the phone more than 2 weeks and now the screen is broken. Reading online, as a weird exception from the other Samsung phones, this one doesn't come with Gorilla Glass. So buyer beware, if you drop this phone THE SCREEN WILL BREAK. Very dissapointed in this phone, don't buy it.
Scratch on my gorilla glass. How come?  I don't know how it is possible but Samsung galaxy Sii with gorilla glass has a scratch on its visor. Probably because it is not a real gorilla glass. Poor Samsung. It will never be an apple. I am still waiting an answer from you about that. Thanks
Not good  It was not what i expected. There was sn issue with the screen (big issue) also there is a problem with the log on. Too many bumps...a really bad Quality used iPhone. I wish they could turn me back my money. I feel scamed
False advertising in the specifications.. only 550mb of RAM  The description on the product clearly states it has 1gb of ram yet. Mine was always freezing and generally slow, and then I noticed they mine only has 550mb of RAM. I don't recommend the product, you won't get what you paid for and were expecting. Bought from aSavings.
Great phone better than the old one  I love the new updates on this phone than the old iPhone 3 but there were a few miner issues n One BIG issue! I've had it now for 3 weeks almost 4, when I got it I was pleased to see they wrapped it up good and was just what the picture description says it is except the 16 GB it's a 13 n was all in Chinese so took some time changing it since I can't read Chinese n there were no instructions for it. The Mayjor issue is it goes in n out of signal it will go from perfect signal to no signal n drop my calls. Went two days with it saying no signal searching! I've never had that issue til I got this phone! Other than those issues it's a very nice phone. Had no scratches. The screen being smaller I hate but definitely better than my old IPhone. Pictures look more professional n clear. Repost: Phone stopped working completely had to take it to an iPhone store in Greenville found out it wasn't an original iPhone. Seller took pieces of an iPhone and refurbished it to sell as a iPhone. It isn't an iPhone do not buy. Its a scam.
keep it pack of s***
really a bad cell phone arrived damaged at all do not recomnend to anyone
This device is locked
It was lost in the delivery.
Did not work once we got it.
User interface not friendly. This item is overpriced.
not recommend
No headphones  No headphones and dirty iphone
This is a garbage faulty cell phone  This is a garbage faulty cell phone, battery life was decent at first for a month then continued to drop rapidly for 3 months until it died at %100 battery life, wasted 300 dollars on a paper weight save your money and buy USA unlocked from best buy or a store that offers a refund.
Terrible  Condition said Good when I bought it. The condition is clearly less than fair. Scratches on the metal.. Screen.. Back Cover... Battery isn't holding a charge. I needed a phone in a hurry & it looks like you clearly get what you pay for. What gets me though is I could have bought a refurbished device that would have been miles better than this and I think I will since the phone itself is perfect for me and easy to  use. I am really put off by the sellers presentation and overall quality of what was received for the price paid.
Don't buy it folks!! Overpriced!!!!! Coming soon to Amazon Store!  Don't buy it folks!! Overpriced!!!!! Coming soon to Amazon Store!  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!
Horrible  It is not especified that the Iphone is used. And the earphones that came with him are not originals, even the charger isn't.
Bad bloatware
phone is very slow
Two stars  Scratched and broken
Not sure if it was the seller or just the phone itself. I bought this in December of 2017 and it died on me by aril 2018. In April, out of nowhere the phone immediately went into safe mode and locked my ATT account telling me that it was flashed with an improper bios. Then it wouldnt charge. When I did try to charge the phone it actually melted the charging chord I used. Also,The battery sucked. I could not get 4 hours with it no matter how little I used it. Not happy.
Fantastic phone at first, then it became junk...  The phone is a very solid build when I first have it. But then two problems came: 1. The front face camera leaks dust and now it has accumulated so much dust that the camera is not usable. 2. The proxy sensor issue where phone immediately goes dark during a phone call even if I am not near the phone. From the little research I have done, the above two problems are very common issue and have no resolution. And I have contacted Nokia, and these issues are not even covered in warranty. I am very disappointed. I will go get myself a new phone after 4-5 month use of Lumia 920.
full of scratches  Mobile full of scratches and is not very good as it was said
i am nokia lover and a huge fan of nokia, however this model really really disappointed me. For starters the phone keep wipping itself clean every week so i have to keep reinstallig all my apps and numbers. battery life not so go.  really not what i am use to with my nokia 900. my son was very very disappointed because he loves my phone. Will have to look for another phone for him.
and THAT really is not very nice.  cell arrived with no problem in battery lasts even two hours , I touch the charger Carry all sides so that when placing That I Download loading , and THAT really is not very nice.
Not a good phone.  It won't connect to my data plan and the screen won't turn off on it's own. Of course it started doing these things a few days after my return date. I'm a LG fan but I have not been happy with this phone.
Sudden Death Syndrome  I actually enjoyed my galaxy s3 immensely. But after eight months it simply died without warning. Look it up: it's the galaxy sudden death syndrome. This is especially common in this specific model with 16GB.  NO ONE IS TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS. Not surge telecom. Not Samsung. Not Amazon. Money down the drain.  I'm never buying Samsung again.
Was very disappointed is was Not a new phone
the charger does not work
Phone keeps going off and over heating
I received this Product with a defective battery , the cellphone restarting over and over again , and only shows the LG logo , i had to read it in a foum post about this issue , and there saying is a battery problem, so I bought a new one battery and resolve problem
The Battery is bad, dichargue faster.
Disappointed. Phone not unlocked  Really disappointed. 1) the phone is NOT Unlocked! It says the phone is locked and cannot be unlocked. 2) the SIM card slot gives issues. When we tried another carrier's SIM card, the a lot could not open when trying to remove the sim.
BUYER BEWARE! Phone has a hardware issue  Sooner or later, your Nexus 5X will turn off and never boot up again. If it does, it will only be for a brief moment before turning off again. This is a well documented issue in online forums. Today  I lost very important messages and Pictures because of this. Do yourself a favor and buy another model or get stuck with an expensive paper weight.
I did not like the phone do to its camera  I did not like the phone do to its camera, so I sent it back and now 9 days later BREED has still not refunded us.
This phone looks really good initially. Real problem is in 3 to 4 months time, battery is draining so fast. Sometimes, it drops from 40% to 0%.
Product features are not what you get  This phone comes with no SD card, although it is clearly listed as one of the product features. I can't even try the camera without a card. I called customer service and the person was not only unhelpful but rather rude. THIS IS DECEIVING INFORMATION. If the phone is sold without a card -which a necessary element for it to function properly- the add should say so. I will probably never buy from this company again.
I feel upset and a little angry about the accessories.  I bought my iphone from Amazon Warehouse. The cellphone is perfect, but the accessories are not. When I connected my iphone to my computer with the lightning, it cannot work. But it works well with my friend's lightning. So I compared my accessories with his, I found that they are quite different, and I am pretty sure his accessories are original beacuse he bought his iphone from apple store. Though my iphone is an used one, but it is "like new", and according to the definition of "like new", the accessories should be original, but mine are OEM. I trust Amazon, but I feel hurt now. I still believe Amazon is the best seller of the world, and I believe you can improve your service to a higher level.
Seller gave me A bad deal  I think the phone is a good phone but the seller on Amazon give me a bad deal with the phone because it is not holding the charge for any long period of time.
Awful product  Not a good product at all! I have only had this product for 5 months and it is already having so many problems. It overheats, keyboard doesn't work well and is super sensitive, and it has the worst battery life. Very disappointed and upset that I wasted money on it. I should have just paid the extra money and bought it straight from the apple store.
nexus 5 32gb unloock  I received 16GB instead 32gb. I purchased nexus 5 32gb unloock and I received nexus 5 16gb on  open box.
Great in the beginning but after a few days it started having a few issues. It freezes and sometimes the screen locks on its own while I'm using it.
Buyer Beware  I purchased a used iPhone 5s from this seller. The phone worked fine at first but after only a year of using it, the "blue screen of death" appeared and my phone stopped functioning. I attempted to fix the problem and when I took the screen off of the phone I noticed that someone had already taken one of the screws off of the board under the screen. I suspect the seller attempted to fix the problem and then sold me the phone. I was hoping to get two years out of the phone but only got one. I would not recommend buying used products from this seller.
venezuela  writing of Caracas and Venezuela have a question wanted saver if the input is in the loaded state perfcto like its camera software works well on touch screen and if this unlocked
The Box was unsealed. I thought I am buying a brand new phone but it turns out to be used.
In the specification was not mentioned that is AT&T mobile which does not support Wifi calling. I returned it back
Buyer beware  The description indicated this device was for AT&T network but when it arrived to my surprise it was a T-Mobile device. Also the battery wouldn't keep a charge. I contacted the seller twice for a replacement battery and both wouldn't hold a charge. The phone itself was in almost perfect condition besides a few scratches unnoticeable on the screen, if this mobile device was actually for AT&T network and the battery held a charge everything would be perfect. My suggestion is purchase at your own risk.
Basically stopped working after 1 month  Phone stopped working after 1 month. Couldn't make or receive calls 80% of the time. Had to eventually change phone
Poor performance  LG Nexus 5 does not work properly. Repeatedly shuts off when I touch the power button
did not work
Refurbishment  I bought this phone for my son's birthday thinking it would be a new phone. Turns out, the phone goes off everything 5mns if not used. We had to keep turn it back on.
not what I expected from this product  the phone is failing, just restarts, overheats, not what I expected from this product, the middle button sometimes fails, I live in Venezuela and I can hardly get much dollars in order to buy and get the phone contains errors
shipping is fast and it was easy to return it back  The iphone I received is broken and keep turning on and off by itself. However, shipping is fast and it was easy to return it back.
BATTERY ISSUES  Battery Issues, does not keep charge! Great phone but I would recommend you buy from a different seller. You aren't able to contact seller at all, neither can Amazon.
Unfortunate Choice Of Company  It was unfortunate that I bought a phone from World Wide Distributions. In my opinion this company can not be  trusted to do the right  thing when they have taken your money and kept  the returned Samsung Galaxy S4 I9500 16GB version Phone.  I have constantly kept in touch with this  company to try and  come to some sot of  resolution but  they have chosen to stop communicating with me.  There  seems to be some dispute about shipping  costs!! here is a breakdown of money I have spent with this company. Price of the phone in US $605.28 : 449.25 Unfortunately the Phone  was not compatable  with the European Network so I returned it and asked for a replacement Phone but  never received another phone, on top of that I received a customs bill for  86.30. I then had pay an extra  amount to ship it back to the  company for 47.74. Purchase of the phone was ordered Sept 28/9/2013  and shipped on the  30/09/2013 to arrive between October 2 and  October 7. This company should  not be allowed to trade as not only have they kept my money  they have also kept the phone which no doubt they have probably resold. And have acknowledge the fact that they had receive it!!!  How does one get redress when dealing with a company in the U.S. If I am In the wrong in some way then the company should have the decency the inform me be e-mail instead of  ignoring my e-mails this company should hang it head in shame? I suppose my only redress would be is that you think before you buy.
Item not received as described  Upon receiving item, I immediately activated it but to find out it can only be used on speaker phone. The internal handset audio would not work. Had to return it to the seller
nunca llego
Broken camera  The phone was delivered on time, but defective, camera will show moving purple streak , spots, lines, the whole camera take, and the picture it takes shows the purple as well... Not cool, Now camera app not even launching..... minor note, it also has some scratches on the sides that would not present on a new phone.  Phone is now is argentina, so will try to get it repaired here.  Would not buy from this seller again.
It sucks, It really really sucks. Battery life is the worst ever. EPIC FAIL!  This phone SUCKS!. This is the worst smart phone I have ever owned. Really its one of the worst devices I have ever owned.  The biggest issue is the battery life. It is always plugged in. Also if you use it while its plugged in, it will take forever to charge. I  plugged in at night to charge and left the phone on. 8 hours later the battery had only charged like 25 %. Last night I turned the phone off completely with a 30% charge. Turned on this morning and the battery was completely empty would not even turn on without the charger. How is that even possible?  There is a reason you can remove the battery. If you use the phone the way you expect to be able to you will have to charge every 5 hours or carry another battery. Dont buy this phone from anyone. Get another manufacture. Anything is better than this POS.
Was very excited when i purchased this phone, However six months later i took up the phone and it felt really hot, the phone then shot down and never came back on. I took the phone to the repair shop and was told the board is not good. According to the technician it would be best to get a new phone instead of getting a new board, so didn't get it repaired. Such a waste of MONEY. Really disappointed with this phone.
Product not as described!  This product was not as described.  The description said unlocked,  but this was not the case, it was an inconvenience to send the phone back, so I  had to shell out another  $25 to get the phone  unlocked myself. The phone worked fine, but I only bought it on the premise that it was unlocked, which it was not, false advertising!
iPhone 6s is NOT UNLOCKED  As mentioned in the title of the product, we were expecting the iPhone 6s as unlocked. However we saw that it is locked as shown in the attached photo and there is a T-Mobile SIM card inside it. Also there is no SIM card pin in the box. This iPhone is in Turkey now but I could not use it with my own SIM card from Turkcell (carrier company in Turkey). I want to unlock the phone and use it in Turkey, so I am expecting from the seller to find a solution for my unjust treatment. I mean, I need guidance (steps) to unlock the phone without jailbreaking or something unofficial? <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Apple-iPhone-6s-64-GB-US-Warranty-Unlocked-Cellphone-Retail-Packaging-Rose-Gold/dp/B015E8UTIU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Apple iPhone 6s 64 GB US Warranty Unlocked Cellphone - Retail Packaging (Rose Gold)</a>
Problems with Galaxy S III unlocked cell phone  The phone is unlocked but it will not connect to my Internet/phone service provider and only connects to WiFi signal locations.
TERRIBLY FRUSTRATED  This is good looking and great phone but I received a defective one with a pretty bad battery, almost to blow out. As a foreign buyer  ( Venezuelan ) I had no time to return the item, because 30 days is too short for us. I do not blame Amazon for this. This is a Venezuelan people problem, but I really do not understand. How hell this could be happened with a new HTC phone?. Let me recommend to some other buyers to Amazon, TO THINK SEVERAL TIMES before buying an HTC phone .There is another important thing, I bought the phone to T.J. GLOBAL. How come Amazon sent to me a phone from BEST PRICE MOBILE? Could AMAZON explain to me and maybe to the bunch of buyers that it has. Why This?
Very Bad phone  After 2 months the speaker is bad and I cant update because there is not enough space! I have a 32gb memory stick installed and nothing on the phone! I would not get this phone I would look at others phones 1st!
Not user friendly  Over all apple products are very manipulative, and overpriced. I try my phone for almost 5 days and no matter what application I want to access I have to connect my I-phone to my I-tone!! And of course I have to give all my personal information i.e. my address, my e-mail, my phone number even credit card number!!!! It is absolutely ridicules. Also the futures on this phone compare to Galaxy from Samsung are comparing apples and oranges. This phone doesn't offer anything without connecting to your I-tones.
I bought this piece of junk in August, One ...  I bought this piece of junk in August 2016. One day in December (4 months later), I felt some heat in my trouser pocket. To my horror, the phone battery slipped from 80 % to 30 % in about 30 minutes without actively using it. The phone turns off, and never turns back on! It keeps going through this endless cycle until the battery drains out. I sent it to LG, and they returned it to me saying there was a physical damage, and that they could not replace it. They also said that my warranty is void for the same reason. The company is not willing to take any responsibility to repair it either. I should have been wise enough not to trust this company. I will never buy a phone from this maker (LG).  Please be aware!  Note: I must add that Amazon contacted my seller on my behalf, and made them to issue 80% refund. This, after 4 months of my purchase. I must thank Amazon for their service.
Scammer!!!
I sure it will be a great phone for most  Did not meet my exceptions, was more then I wanted. I sure it will be a great phone for most.
No good phone, I'm tired of this! I've waited to long for a refund, and return shipping label
Get something different.  Came to me damaged and in the first week of use the charger cord was bad. The battery dies fast and take a long time to charge. I think I was sold a faulty phone. Oh and if you need instructions you better know Spanish. Actually the instructions sheet was a joke. It was in a foreign language and was photo copied and looked ridiculous. I thought this phone was a good deal but now I wish I would have paid the extra money for something better.
the cell becomes very hot during use
ITS NOT NEW AND DONT WORK PROPERLY!  When I bought I chose  it from the new phones option. I ordered a new, unlocked 3gs iPhone. This one won't work properly, I can't even do a restart on iTunes!
Dont buy  Good good phone.....took very long to reach......worst buy using the phone and I just see lines start appearing in the phone not as if it fell even 2 weeks before
NOT COMPATIBLE WITH VERIZON!!!
This has to be one of the most pathetic phones i have ever bought  This has to be one of the most pathetic phones i have ever bought.  I have been a Samsung user for all my life, but after buying this phone, I have realized that samsung is not what it used to be.  This model has an extremely slow processor, constantly hangs, and is so slow that you can't use google maps real time.  Should never be purchased by anyone
I bought this phone and within a a week the circuit board was fried. there is also no support from Samsung or anybody. so be careful when buying with no warranty.
NOT unlocked  This is NOT an unlocked phone! It will not work with T-mobile! Not cool!!!!!
I am disappointed with this  I ordered white and but i got black color. I am disappointed with this purchase
DO NOT BUY  Horrible device. Just got it, has been on the charger for HOURS and will not turn on! Brand new and won't charge? Wtf?
Hi, The phone that was sent not start , note that modified it...
Useless  Phone did/does not receive recalls. Not very useful as such
Very Disappointed  The seller said this product was refurbished, but it was not refurbished with Apple components and there are some things wrong with the phone: the home button only works one out of three times (so I have to push it a lot before it actually works), and no matter how loud I set the volume for the ringer when a phone call is coming through, it will only vibrate. Most of all, though, I am disappointed that I was led to think this was Apple-factory refurbished, yet there are non-Apple parts in the phone, which means they are not working as well as they could be together and some functions of the phone are very slow. I have bought refurbished products from apple.com directly and have never had this problem, so I believe that this phone was improperly refurbished by a non-Apple party.
erroneous specifications, does not have the bottom cover of pin loading, water enters.
I gave up and bought one on SWAPPA which worked fine. BTW  This phone seemed to be in mint condition, but upon putting the sim card in it, it would not find the AT&T network here for more than 2 to 3 seconds before it "dropped".  I spent hours on the phone with AT&T and brought the phone into the AT&T store with no luck.  I had no problem receiving a refund, but after 3 phones, I gave up and bought one on SWAPPA which worked fine.  BTW, both my son and the AT&T rep said that they could tell from the packaging and the sticker inside the battery compartment that this was not an AT&T phone.
only lasted 2 weeks  At first I loved this phone. It has a lot of features for fairly cheap. However, it only lasted 2 weeks. One night I charged it and in the morning it was dead. Would not turn on at all. I have 2 batteries, so I put a fully charged battery in it and it still would not turn on. After doing some research on the internet I found that this is happening to many phones. It is being called "sudden death syndrome". Three of my kids have the same phone and now I am worried that theirs will do the same thing. Because it was an international phone and made in the UK i have to contact them to have it repaired. Would not recommend this phone, neither will I buy a new one.
Defected product  So depressed the phone doesn't working at all and it's feature that it is unlocked but it's locked and I tried to fix the problem but it doesn't work at all
Does not work properly..  The mobile arrived quickly,  but does not work properly.. can not read micro SIM..
The Cellphone has the microphone bad
It keep turning off for no reason
Crappy build quality  Hasn't even been a full year of owning the phone,  yet the charger will never stay in.. Even if the phone is stationary sometimes it pops out. Wouldnt recommend this phone to anyone who ever uses their phone while it charges...
I am very disappointed with this purchase  This phone is not working properly. I am very disappointed with this purchase.
phone fell once, with a hardbody case and glass screen protector and broke lcd screen. little fall did huge damage,
Zte Axon 7 is a Heartbreaker  The ZTE Axon 7 won me over.  I bought it and promptly discovered 4 very Chinese apps that have ultimate control over your phone.  Their permissions are ridiculous and they come pre-loaded with no way to get them off.  It is clearly used for data collection.  An example of permissions included gives them the right to read texts and record audio...  The only way around having these apps send your data back to some remote server every 72 hours or so during their "updates" is to unlock the bootloader and delete them using a third party software.  I don't like to void warranties when they are one of the main selling points of the phone,  so please, ZTE,  take this phone back and let me have my money.
VERY BAD  I could only use the phone for a day. I went out and did not return to power on the phone. you drive Technical Service and was informed that no repair. I do not recommend this seller. very bad.
Does not work for me  This phone sucks. Freezes up a lot and won't load web pages. I regret buying it.
It is not a good phone.  I bought this phone for my daughter. I worked for few weeks and started having problems. It doesn't recognise the network and has to be restarted several times a day just to get the network for few minutes. After few months, it has stopped working totally. It is not  a good phone.
check your phone out when you buy it  My screen wasn't even fully on my phone when I got it but it works I guess
Liars.  They lied to everyone promising a KitKat update. This phone will forever live on Jelly Bean.
The phone looks nice but its defective . sounds rebound and not just that , but they company sells you used phone.  Don't you guys ever buy any phone from this company , they will see you used phone  and its a all defective . i bought one and when i received it in the mail the box was looking old . and it have only charger no , headphone nothing . and it has problem of voice rebounding so i told them to changed it for me and they send another one . but i didn't open the box. i only open the package , i didn't open the box because the seal of the box looks already open and the box look used ,
This wasn't what I expected.  I purchased this phone expecting a fairly solid and simple unlocked quadband phone and web browser to take on a vacation abroad (if I ever go on another vacation abroad.)  I have played with it for a week.  The instructions included are poor, but there are a lot of good instructions on the Internet.  The over all impression is that the phone was built and sold so that Microsoft could collect as much personal data about the user as possible. The only possibility for at least semi private browsing is Opera Mini from the Windows Store, which, after trying it out, has itself changed from previous versions to a piece of software that has few instructions even online, and is pretty impossible to use.  Not worth the hours of trouble, either one of them.  The master reset, however works just fine, and I am now bundling it up to give to Goodwill.  Someone with another use for it may find it acceptable.
very bad  very bad
we are being lied to!!  although it does seem to be a great phone so far. As advertised as a 8 gigabyte d620r but for some reason the phone information says it's a D620 no R in sight. I hate buying stuff from sellers to find out that I was lied to. I also see looking through these comments that I am not the only 1 with this issue. I suppose that explains why the barcode was scratched out on the box and there were stickers over the original  descriptions.
I am so disappointed!!  I am so disappointed!!! I got my phone and it seemed used, not the original charger!! No headphones!! And apps were already installed I am very displeased!!!
You never know what you'll get as far as reliance when you buy something.  Material, sound and picture quality are all good. My complaint is after 11mos. of use I turn on screen and its half blank. I have to hit the side of the phone on my hand and it goes away and my phone hasn't been dropped to cause this. Contacted ZTE techs and they wanted $200.00 to fix it after I've paid almost $500.00 for the phone. I believe I'm done with ZTE. Hope you have better luck.
Its an Open Box Item, please don't buy one  These people are cheating us, they are sending us an open box item, the products looks okay but you are not sure what is happening with it. I am going to return my product. DOnt trust these people.
To start with, the initial phone configurations is in Chinese i guess. Took me a while to change the settings on the pone back to English. Was able to get it done and started to use the phone and was a little satisfied with the use until i tried asking my friend to call on the phone to check if its unlocked. It was unlocked but the ringer volume was very feeble and no one had mentioned about it in the reviews. I could barely hear it when it was like 2 feet away from me and i also tried adding different ringtones but it was of no use. I feel the ringer volume is an important feature in a phone as i would miss many calls even if the phone is next to me so i would give this phone 2 stars. If the ringer volume is not so much of a deal for you and if you over look it then i would give this product 3 stars.
El telefono vino malo
This is a defective item
It was completely damaged within the meaning of the battery and the function of this
Complete scam. The only upside was that the phone came very quickly. Other than that, it's charger does not even charge the phone at all. The phone is COMPLETELY useless considering you can not hear anyone on a call or even having them on speakerphone...I don't even mean it's just muffled, I mean their voices are BARELY audible and are morphed and almost sound demonic through our end of the phone. I bought this for my little brother so he can hangout with his friends but still check in with me wherever he goes, but this is completely useless now. Waste of time and money. Do NOT order from this person. Please read the reviews and you'll see how off ALL his/her products are!
HTC one M9 from "NEXECOM"  This is a locked phone with a variant OS that will not accept security or system updates.
caution to buyer.  check for compatiblilty with you carrier  This product is not compatible with Verizon.  I spent two hours at the Verizon store along with tech services and a store rep trying to get this phone to sync.  No go.  I would double check with the carrier before purchasing this item.
The item which I got was malfunctioning, poor battery that lasted for three hours and couldn't hear most of the voice calls. At one point it started restarting every minute when the phone is not in use. Highly disappointed with the purchase !
this is very very slow. when i open more then 3 apps ate going hang. its also not charging more then 90%. battery life is only 2 hours. Im always carry charger with me. It was my wrong idea to buy this one
Memory is TOO small!
DO NOT RECOMMEND!!  This phone says unlocked but I could not get mobile data to work because of the AT&T software auto updates. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!
It was already damaged
can give a review because I bought it for a friend  I bought it for a friend
total disappointment  defective phone, signal issues (not service related/tried 2 services) phone was reset to factory several times many tech support options were done nothing helped, phone shuts itself off randomly, microphone is defective as well people complain they cannot hear you, international phones CANNOT be replaced by the USA Samsung warranty, be cautious about buying international phones, this phone has not been dropped or any injury caused to phone, otterbox used for protection as well.
Not an us version phone and also no warranty as said in the description. 4G/LTE, FACTORY UNLOCKED, US/SOUTH AMERICAN VERSION, 1YEAR WARRANTY 32GB
having problems with this phone and the screen won't unlock.. the keyboard does not work.. and Samsung not able to fix it.......
Microphone does not work after 7 month  It is really a great phone for the value. Too bad the microphone broke after 7 month of me getting the phone. Now people can't hear me on any voice chat now. Sad day for me. else I would loved the phone and its super long battery life.
Don't get it!  I was expecting the S5 to be perfect. I am an iPhone user and I wanted something new, but I also needed to use this phone over seas so I decided to get it online with an unlocked version. When I started using it the battery duration was awful. It barely lasted for half a day. The phone was slow and the keyboard lagged. I went to Samsung customer service and they said they couldn't do anything about it because my phone was international and they could only help with US phones. They are still trying to help me work it out but this is so stressful and disappointing. I would not suggest you to buy this through amazon. Spend a little bit more money and get it at another local store.
Motherboard broken, now a useless brick!  In the first month I really liked this phone - it was nice and fast.  A few month the problems begun: The Akku did not last for more that 4 hours, which makes it practical not usable.  However - now it has the problem of the so-called boot-loop - it does not start again and tried to boot and boot again.  This failure is caused by a broken motherboard. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee on this "International Version" of the phone - so, even it is a manufacture failure, LG will not repair or replace it.  This was the last time I purchased something from LG. Custom support is something different!
Disappointed in this used iPhone 4  The qualifications and descriptive warnings regarding this used iPhone did not include all the problems. The recipient of this gift traded it (plus $95) for a comparable and more functional used iPhone 4.
Don't buy LG phones, they're now infamous for bootloop issues.  Update 12/13/17: Whoa, remember when this thing had 4.5* reviews? Now it's dropped to an average of 3*. Had this phone for 1 year before it first started acting up around May of this year, the screen had a defect in the corner so I sent it in to LG to be repaired. They sent it back to me with pen marks, new scratches, and an unclosed corner that I could no longer snap shut, but at least it worked. Now in December, the phone has started bootlooping, and the phone is no longer in warranty. Google can't do anything about it since I purchased from Amazon, know this and always buy your Google Phone from Google in the future, at the very least they can send you a refurb.  I think I will pass on all Google Phones in the future. The OS is great because it's simple, it doesn't come with the extra garbage apps that you can't delete like carrier phones and most other models. The hardware is probably going to continue being an issue so long as they keep letting LG manufacture for them. Doesn't seem to be any LG phones in the past couple of years that hasn't dropped in ratings over the course of a year due to bootlooping. Will never buy an LG product again unless they start shaping up.  Review at time of purchase: Functions pretty well at all things I use it for. The one downside is that there's no way to quickly reboot the phone if it crashes. All you can do is wait for it to finish crashing and reboot itself.
different item  we are big fan of apple products, we use the macbook pro, desktops, all the family has the iPhones in use and the ipods as well, but we ordered factory unlocked product, and now we discovered that they sent us a mobile with sim place on the side, which is not very pro. at all. and now we need to ship the item on our cost to the seller, money will not returned in a while as well.....
Did not work was broken
I sent it back...  This unit wouldn't hold a charge for more than two hours.  Apple wasted a LOT of my time pretending to help me with the issue, to no avail.  The actual seller offered no help whatsoever.  I was relatively happy using my iPod 5 for the past three years... but this 6 is a piece of junk!
IPhone 6 plus is junk  I bought phone for$350.00 .I have used it for less than 2 months, loved it . Until it got sick. It has I touch disease. Now I am stuck with a useless piece of junk. I will not buy thru Amazon again I would STRONGLY recommend that NO ONE buy this product from anyone. I have joined a class act lawsuit against Apple.
I received the device and when you start using it , I find that when I make a call, nobody listens to me . In other words, the smartphone's microphone is useless. I live in Venezuela and the shipping company from USA gave me one weeks ago the phone. I need the seller of the device help me solve my problem . I will be grateful if you do so . Because I have a cell that does not serve me .
so interesting , but big for small hand and so fast go hot battery
GUESS THEY HIDE BAD REVIEWS. NOT UNLOCKED!!!
Got D8000 AT&T version instead of D802 unlocked .  The product I got is not the one that I intended to get. It was suppose to be LG G2 D802 unlocked Instead I got LG D800 AT&T version. This version is not supporting 4G in my country I am very much disappointed from this buy. It is not worth the money I paid for it.
Mine lasted 11 months before the earpiece stopped working. The phone was always treated with kid gloves. May still be under warranty but not worth the hassle of shipping it in. I'm  replacing it with an unlocked Motorola E for less than $70. Hopefully it will last at least through the warranty period.
One Stars  Touch pad has stopped responding suddenly. Have done lot and did factory reset also. But still issue is not working. Phone has become like dead with in 4 months.
I ordered for a new phone, but received a refurbished one.  Battery very weak, cant last an hour. Charging all the time.
I bought this phone as a gift for someone... upon using the phone it shuts off completely, when using the camera to take pictures you cannot turn on the flash, it sucks this is the most embarrassing product I bought from Amazon.
Do Not purchase an international phone from ANY seller  Do NOT purchase a international phone through the sellers on Amazon. This S7 Edge is a total piece of crap. LCD went bad after 2 months of delicate use, mainly sitting on the charger. Complete $850 rip-off. No repairs or service provided by Samsung. They gave me an international number to call China. Very disappointed with Samsung's product and service. Amazon needs to remove these international sellers that provide NO warranty for such an expensive product.
My niece took very good care of the phone  About 4 months after purchasing this phone described as NEW by Mobile Stream (I never purchase used or refurbished) the phone stopped working, screen would go black when turning on. Unfortunately I have bought it for my niece to take to Argentina and I couldn't do anything about it until she returned to visit about three weeks ago. I knew the phone didn't have a warranty on it but I still took the time to call Samsung to look into the possibility of having it repaired. Interesting enough, Samsung would have repaired it if it wasn't that they determined by the BER number (inside the phone) that the original phone was black and not white as the one Mobile Stream sold to me. I recognize that electronics fail but my point is that Mobile Stream was not honest and truthful as others vendors are in stating if the phones they sell are used or refurbished. My niece took very good care of the phone, it looks brand new, never dropped, never damaged. Again, my disappointment is not only that the phone failed but also that Mobile Stream has been completely dishonest about this product.
This Seller/Merchant CANNOT be trusted.  This phone was sold as NEW. Apple confirmed that it is 2 years old has been poorly refurbished with non Apple parts on the screen and side trim.
stopped charging within a few months
Unprofessional & Carelessly Packaged.. DIDN'T EVEN WORK!  When I opened the box, I was amazed that these people are still in business! The screen protector was practically sideways on the screen, it was almost dead when I turned it on, so I plugged it in and the cable didn't work AT ALL, and when I used my own phone charger, the phone took a charge for literally less than 30 seconds... Then..... Nothing. Ended up dying and I had to return it 
Poor camera setting very complicated
Had previous owners password programmed it it. Even Apple couldn't get into. Should have been cleaned out and ready to program. Utterly ulseless
Came with a damaged back and now isn't working... Great
Doesn't hold charge any more. I thought it is battery problem, so I bought 3 batteries.
HIGHLY MAD AND ANNOYED.  If I could give the seller zero stars I would. DO NOT BUY FROM SELLER I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AND SOON AS I UNBOXED IT I HAD ISSUES. THE PHONE OVER HEATS WHEN ITS NOT EVEN BEING USED. IT WON'T STAY CHARGED MY PHONE DIES WITHIN A HOUR OF BEING COMPLETELY CHARGED. AMAZON WON'T DISCIPLINE SELLER SAYS THEY'RE A VERIFIED SELLER AS WELL AS A PARTNER. YOU CANT EVEN REPOT THE SELLER. HIGHLY MAD AND ANNOYED.
Don't  think it's new it has glitches , not 16 GB, HeadPhones weren't working properly, and the charger was broke.
The worst experience ever  awful, the camera lent broke only after one month of using it. the guarantee does not work in Argentina. The worst experience ever.
Samsung Galaxy S3 -- unrecoverable "Black Screen of Death"  4 weeks. that's how much functional use I got out of this device. It turns on, I can hear sound, but the screen is black and stays black no matter what I try. I did some online searches to see if there was some combination of button presses that could bring the screen back with no luck. I found that there were a lot of cases like this with the Samsung Galaxy line -- it's a known issue.  Unfortunately, it was past the 1-month return window so I was not able to return the paper weight.
I do not recommend  This Cell Phone have a problem with the autorotation.... I do not recommend buying
not buy it again.  The phone has probably been stooled. If I know that I would never bye that! Locked and cant use it in USA.
Horrible phone - auto restart on its own, cannot uninstall apps and bad battery/cable  Used this together with AT&T for about 9 months. Initially the battery does not charge. Seller sent new battery, but problem still persist until I changed my cable to HTC's. But still, the battery depletes really fast. The phone auto restart when I want to uninstall apps. End up I have quite a few apps I would like to get rid of. Anyone can help? Oh, the phone also restart as and when it likes. No way to return the phone too.  Update after 1 year: This phone is really really terrible. The flashlight suddenly don't work on it's own. I have to shut it down (cannot even restart) then it can work. All the unwanted apps still cannot be uninstalled. There are times when the phone don't react and I have to close the app and reopen again. The camera function is getting really slow. I bought this phone to take my baby's pic, but as she moves so fast and so much, camera function should be fast, so as to capture "the moment", but it usually only started after more than 5s after I clicked. Very useless phone. Very frustrating. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!
Was broken, did not work!
Unfortunately Expiramental  A nice phone with as advertised has great built in speakers. The ability of the phone to generate software menus using any bottom keys if your software requires it. A software I've used many years on every Android I've ever had would not work on this phone.
had to get it fixed twice because of bootloop lg has a terrible
It said its with straight talk but when I put my straight talk sim card in it it started messing up. Its a good phone but make sure that your company that you're with will go with this phone, and that it's compatible with your company or service. Love the pictures love the weight of the phone its a great phone all way around, but for some reason the internet on it is super slow, don't know if it's straight talk or the phone
nightmare and un-satisfaction  Dear Sirs: I don't know how to express my nightmare and un-satisfaction with the purchase of the iPhone, I bought it for my daughter who lives outside the United States and this is what I got:  1-when charging the battery the charge goes up and them back and back until it turns of for lack of battery, so I have to restart it to be able to see the real battery chargethat that by the way if it says 100% full charge and a couple of minutes later goes down to 80% and them within 2 hours without use goes out of battery 2-the bottom part of the scream does not work, when you try putting the password you can't due it because the tactile part of the bottom screen does not work. 3-when answering a call with the volume at maximum volume you can barely hear the other person.  In my opinion the product is a total failure, I have thrown my money to waste, may daughter so disappointed with the gift I gave her, and will NEVER NEVER again buy any electronic Item from this vendor or any vendor through AMAZON.COM, my recommendation ZERO "0"  is a piece of junk.  Sincerely yours Ramon J. Yepez
Not enough features
Htc will not work with windows 7 64bit.  Case escalated to level 3 support and absolutely of no help.  Their mtp driver is not compatible.
Not bad price but the battery got swollen after a few months.
No LTE on tmobile network  Do not buy this phone if you are a t-mobile user LTE doesn't work
Galaxy S6 - good phone, especially notable if coming from phones a few generations back...but beware android update hell.  I am evaluating the Galaxy S6 920F through a narrow lens. We upgraded to Galaxy S6s from Galaxy S2s, and  until now, we have purchased  our phones on contract through AT&T as our carrier. We bought two phones through Amazon (Tek Deals). The phones arrived on time and in sealed boxes with a separate two prong European to US power adapter that fits on the European round pin charger. In both phones, the adapter fit too loosely over the European pins, and appeared unable to stay connected with any kind of minor jostling of the cord.  Fortunately, the adapter was easy to take apart and I used a pair of pliers to squeeze the spring clip legs together, which easily fixed the problem. Of course, the adapter does make the charger stick further out. Our old S2 chargers will work, but the charging rate is lower, because they are only 1A chargers, rather than the standard 2A fast charger that comes with the S6. We took the phones to our local AT&T carrier store, and obtained SIM chips; I was pleased that the SIMs and switch over was free ( at least in our area). We have had these phones a little over a year, and I have found in necessary to substantially change my glowing review. In the year, Android 5.1.1 was succeeded by Marshmallow 6.01. However, our phones never received the OTA (over the air) update. Our carrier of course will not update the phones. I  called Samsung and they said the phones would have to be sent in to Samsung to receive updates, because they are from the U.A.E. We live in the US and are not citizens of the UAE. If you are the type who changes phones on a yearly basis, or is happy with the current operating system. regardless of potential new features or potential security issues, then you have no problems. Otherwise, you have two options: Either send the phone to Samsung to be updated, or second, manually update by using the independent Odin software package, and finding the latest android image file from an independent web site. Both cases are not optimal, and though I have not manually tried updating yet, which is a bit involved, the latter is more acceptable  Coming from the Galaxy S2 to the S6 constitutes a big uptick in speed of everything, from downloading to app loading and operation. The screen is not only larger, but as expected, much sharper. We downloaded the Samsung Smart Switch mobile apps to the new and old phones to transfer as much information as possible. The app worked great. Google accounts transferred seamlessly, but some other accounts manually updating the username and passwords. Of course, all the wifi routers passwords had to be added manually.  One feature missing on the phone, which apparently exists on US carrier branded phones, is the ability to alphabetically arrange apps with a one button click. At this time, apps are organized by when they were downloaded. App reorganization is a manual operation that can take quite a bit of time.  I was used to seeing 4G/LTE on the notification panel on our old branded S2s, but on the 920F, only "4G" shows up. This worried me, despite researching that the necessary channels for 4G/LTE are active on the phone. From reading, and I believe, editing out misinformation on some sites, the international version only shows "4G", which is "4G/LTE".  As noted by others, updates seem to just keep coming over a couple of days, but compared to an S2, the updates happen several times faster.  The phone is slippery; wife already dropped hers once, and it was only one day old! Fortunately, no damage. New case will help.  A concern,  like for others, was battery life. It is often very difficult to compare usage from other users, who too often complain about battery life, without a hint about their usage.  We live around 1/4 mile from the nearest cell tower, which is line of site, so 4G communication is quite good. Our wifi routers are generally within 50 ft of where the phones are used in our multilevel home.  Wifi is used on an intermittent basis for updates or adding apps or heavy browsing sessions, to ensure staying under our carrier plan data cap.  I am definitely a low level user, checking weather several times a day, reading and composing a few messages a day with or without attachments, an occasional email, and taking several camera shots a week. Syncing is set to automatic. I do not listen to music on the phone, or watch videos during the test periods.  I may average a couple of calls a day. I may use a browser several times a day in either 4G/LTE mode or wifi.  There were a number of updates or apps downloaded during the test measuring periods..  With power saving mode activated, I monitored  my average battery usage over several charges. After 32 hrs battery reserve was down to ~65 %. Somewhere between 46 hrs to 67 hrs, battery reserve was 53%-56%.  A worst case was leaving wifi on for about 10 hours, which drained the battery to 65% capacity in 23 hrs with minimal use (mianly overnight). Obviously, as a low level user, close to a cell phone tower and wifi routers, these values represent a minimal battery drain comparison baseline. I can get away with charging my wife evey second day. My wife's usage is greater, but even in her case, battery usage was similar, and she could charge every second day if she wished, but she is used to charging her phone every day anyway.  For those whose life is not marginalized by their cell phone, I would say battery life should be quite acceptable and noticeably better, especially if upgrading from a smart phone that is several generations (like three years) back.  Compared to our S2, my impression is that wifi mode does not drain the phone battery nearly as fast as our old S2s
This phone only lasted 3 months. Maybe only a few weeks after receiving it, it started having charging issues. It would not hold a charge and took forever to charge up. Eventually, it stopped charging completely and wouldn't turn on anymore. Also, when I uploaded it to my Verizon account and activated it, it came up as an "Amber Brown" phone despite being white. So when I had to get it replaced by insurance, both Verizon and Asurion would not replace it with a white phone because the code in the phone is for an Amber Brown one. Do not order from this seller.
Microphone doesnt work when speaker is on  When the speaker is working people can't hear me speak Would like to switch product Please contact me regarding this issue
Headphone jack  Revived my phone and it does have a working headphone jack
NOT FACTORY UNLOCKED!!!!!  NOT UNLOCKED!!!!! beware!!! Also as soon as I plugged the phone it got really hot!!! I saw the reviews an made a huge mistake by giving it a chance... Do not buy this lie!!! False advertisement!!! Repeat it is NOT a factory unlocked phone
Don't purchase here  I purchased this item around two months ago and at first the screen didn't work properly which is because Ithought it was a nice new screen and I couldn't get oil on it or some idiotic excuse, I put a screen protector on it and it worked fine. Fast forward two months and my screen randomly died  and when I went to a repair shop they said I had two screws missing indicating someone had worked on the phone before. So essentially they are putting bad parts onto phones and reselling them.
From Good to Worst  The phone was great at first, until I realized that it always says searching and no service. I thought it was my phone company, but it was not, and not even the sim card. I know I should have service because people around me have the same service and has very good connection. The seller did not state that there were any thing wrong with the device, but ITunes says differently.
I give this phone to my mother and she said that the phone is crazy...you can send me a new one.. Waiting for your answer..
wasn't able to activate this phone, even when I brought it to a Verizon store
Not happy!!  Was non working phone. Not happy.
Got ripped off don't ever buy.  Id give zero if i could. Never got money vack after sending phone back when it didn't work. Total rip off.
You sold me 2 iphone as good as new, but are defective, the manufacturer's warranty has expired a year ago  Hello, during the last month you ComRes amazon products for several thousand dollars, and I am deeply disappointed with their quality control on some products I've bought you and Amazon. I live in Colombia and now I want to mention two iphone to buy from you last November 26, 2011, both units were shipped without the stamp and one of them is damaged, not working, I contacted the support center apple and they tell me that this team has a warranty expired long ago. I demand an immediate solution, because I think they have deliberately acted in bad faith. I am in Colombia and I demand a refund immediately or send to my home again and sealed equipment. SERIAL NUMBERS ARE DEVICES: 86839WA6Y7H 87922XS9Y7H
Cellphone defective.
Turn off any times ay Day
It didn't last without any reason  My phone broke shortly after I bought it
BUYER BEWARE!!  1 week shy of 1 year, the phone "broke".. the charger port or the battery or both .. won't charge right.. and battery drain even when it is off. and when i check the IMEI # for warranty with HTC, I was notified that although the purchase date is September last year with one year warranty, but HTC told me the warranty expires in May!.  Buyers beware!!.  I will no longer purchase any mobile phone from AMAZON!! u will think and expect a $700 phone will last more than 1 year.!  very upset and pissed off.
Average performance  Often comment
For some reason this phone does not have NFC I'm returning it.
FAKE  The phone is as shown in the picture yet is not factory unlocked. it's set with AT&T and didn't work with my sim card T-mobile. I don't recommend anyone buying from them.
This is a LOCKED phone.  Don't buy this phone. You will not be able to use it anywhere on this planet. Again, this phone is locked to a specific carrier. I wanted to have another iPhone for my travels. This phone is no use to me. I am happy that I checked it before going on my trip. I am certainly returning it.
this phone looks nice but it is terrible it is slow and doesn't work with my network although it says it does i have no 3 or 4 g and i hate it. I cant use my gps or go on the internet without a connection, it does not connect to anything so i can not use it unless i am home connected to my wireless, very disappointed
IT IS NOT UNLOCKED  It is not fully unlocked. Nokia and Amazon should look at this. I feel being cheated. Returning it won't be easy as I live out of USA
I purchased one and brought it to China. It can call and message by using a Chinese sim card, but no data. Not even a 2G GSM. I don't understand why since it said it support worldwide GSM.
SD card tray  I got the phone and the SD card tray is missing
I bought my iPhone in May 2017. When I got it it was working well for a couple months all of a sudden my iPhone starts getting very very hot. Why is that?
Don't spend your money on this phone  This phone was a waste of money. The battery life is terrible. Phone calls and texts don't come in. I was very disappointed.
disappointed with amazon  Don't buy this item it has a bug that HTC and amazon are aware of and they intend to do nothing about it.
Idioma Spanish?
It was defective and  returned.  I was given a monetary reimbursement for it.
Bad Bad
Mislabeled product  Defective iPhone but labeled as "very good" on the website....
the batterie is going down so fast.
Found out product after giving it to my uncle as a gift now i have no recourse whatsover. It will cost me over $130 to ship back a $90 defective phone
So upset  I just got my phone today and it keeps freezing I have to lock it than unlock it so it will act right ..I'm so upset and I waited for this phone for so long ..just hope I don't have to pay to get another one
The phone breaks, doesn't even last 2 years  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! I got this phone thinking it's top of the line, it went dead after year and half of normal usage. I called both Google and LG customer support and after 2 days of calls they wanted me to pay more money to fix it. Very disappointing customer service.
Utter bunk  This phone broke on my first year using it. The battery life was worse than disappointing, and I couldn't even hear my own voice on the other end when I was on a call.  Not was I was looking for.
IPhone 3G  There a few different problems with the phone. I bought if for someone else because I know how nice IPhones can be but this one did not work properly and it will most likely not get used. =(
Phone caught on fire!!  This phone caught on fire, and burned. Do not purchase.
Terrible  Don't buy this
Fake iphone 4  This iPhone 4 landed up being fake, it stopped working after 6 months and I took it to a Apple store where they told me the part in the phone had been remove and cheap Chinese parts had replaced the orginals. I will never buy electronic products from Amazon again if this is the type of items they are selling to the public.
Terrible product and customer service from LG and Google  Terrible product!!! we have replaced it twice now. The phone just stops working after 1 year and the warranty has expired. Google & LG are not taking responsibility or helpful. Can we not expect a $400 product to work for at least 2 years? we now have to wait for 2 weeks for LG to decide whether they are willing to repair it. Don't buy an LG or Google product.
Don't waste your money  I "WISH" they would put up a negative start because that phone sucks!! I had to call apple and had a professional IT person who works for the government look at the phone and the blasted thing DOES NOT WORK. Sending it back!!!!
Caveat emptor!! Phone did not match description! Obviously they're clearing the old junk off the shelves. The one I received wasn't  a Windows 8.1..it was an old 7.5!!
I bought one, started using it in February, it worked well even though it had little internal memory. however 4 months later the battery won't hold charge for more than 3 hours, if I'm lucky. DON'T BUY IT!!! NOT WORTH THE HASSLE!
Stollen phone  Phone is junk now tried to resale it was reported stollen
DONT EXPECT SAMSUNG TO SUPPORT THIS PRODUCT IN THE U.S.  I got this phone. The abbreviated manual that comes with it says to go to samsung.com and type in the model number to download the user manual. The website does not recognize the model number. I tracked down their live chat and they say they can't help, but gave a 1-800 number to call for support for the phone. They say it is an "international phone" and they refuse to help anyone in the U.S. You cannot get a manual for the phone. You cannot register the phone. The phone may be great, bu the support is non-existent.
Faulty phones -- has a infinite bootloop problem  Do not buy this phone, if you don't want to invest ~250$ for a phone that is just going to stop working in 1.5 years! Read about the bootloop problem that plagues this phone. I got this cellphone along with the projectfi connection and found to my horror that is just stopped working yesterday morning without any previous signs of trouble. The LG repair is a joke, you are going to have to spend ~100$ to get it fixed and that too with no guarantees when it will break again. As it was beyond the 1 year period of warranty, all that projectfi could do for me was to offer a trade-in. I'll have to spend ~230$ afresh to get the motoX4 now, which is currently the cheapest phone on offer with project fi. However, the reviews so far for moto x4 have been generally good -- so we will see!
Used heavily. Don't buy.  Don't try. It is a waste of time. The label and the website say it's NEW, but I received one with all these SCRATCHES. I'm sure it has been RESEALED and REPACKAGED many times. Return it right away. Should read all the reviews before I place the order.
Seems to be a fake  Phone doesn't seem to be a genuine Samsung product. The packaging and appearance all seemed legit but the phone is kinda glitchy and there is no s beam option which is a Samsung feature I use all the time. Disappointing.  Update: I've had the phone a couples months and the clock will stop working all the time and won't update so setting an alarm to wake up to in the morning is impossible. Lots of issues.
Never work .
cheated  The item was sold as new and in Apple figure active since 2014, therefore it is a used item. The device has technical defects that I discovered. I feel cheated. It's the first purchase I make and I'm very disappointed.
Review about Samsung Warranties, there is actually NO WARRANTY! I actually loved the phone for 49 weeks  This review is about Samsung Warranty, not the phone! I actually loved the phone for 49 weeks. I had model N910H. Three weeks before my warranty was up, I started to have battery drainage. Full charge gone in less than 4 hrs with no use & no apps running. I keep wondering if it had anything to do with their Samsung update. I purchased a new samsung battery, then did a full factory reset & all apps disabled. The phone still looks brand new. It had a Zagg & dual layer caseology. I'm old & really just loved the gold phone. It was purchased through reputable dealer in US. Initially customer support chat, determined my phone was an international unlocked version. Gave me a number specifically for unlocked phones. Any way, long story short I was denied repair because samsung said it was out of warranty. After proving with receipt, they then denied because it is not a US phone. I've been told 4 times now, to go to link to find out what country my phone originated from. Its up to me the consumer to search that out. Fortunately for me, I purchased from a reputable retailer. I have spoke with my local retailer their words "If Samsung won't honor their warranty, yes we will honor it" "Bring in receipt & we will work something out" I don't care what they work out, I will not be returning it for another Samsung phone, after what they have put me through for 3 days.  At the bottom of both my denial letters there is a link "How satisfied were you with the email response you received?" The link doesn't even open! Also a link to FB Support. They're also a US Support & cannot help. Samsungs warranty has been a joke! What I am posting here is a copy & paste of my 2nd denial letter. This does not even include my communications directly through Samsung Support or Samsung FB Support. Everything start to finish trying to deal with warranty & Samsung Support has been the Keystone Cops or Three Stooges. LOL! From all communications, my guess is none of their support personnel are US citizens, in other words US support are non US personnel!  What I am posting here is a copy & paste of my 2nd denial letter. Dear Debbie,  Thank you for taking the time to contact us at Samsung Technical Support. We always appreciate hearing from our customers.  I certainly understand that you are not happy with the previous Email response regarding the service repair of your Galaxy Note 4. I will address to all your questions in this regard.  I would like to tell you that the model number SM-N910H does not belong to a Samsung US phone. Samsung support is country specific and the support regarding the service repair/warranty claim is only available in the country of origin of the phone.  I do agree that you have purchased the phone from a retail store in US. However, as the phone is not a Samsung US phone, the warranty repair option of the phone is not available at our end. I understand that you are not happy with this statement, but the repair parts and skills required for the Samsung international devices are not available at our end as we are only trained for Samsung US phones.  In this case we request you to contact the place of purchase so that they can provide you with the information regarding the country of origin of the phone. Then you can access the below link to contact the dedicated Samsung country support team so that they can help you to repair your phone/help you to claim for the warranty repair.  Link: [...]  Should you desire additional assistance, we invite you to access the web-link [...] to speak to a Chat Specialist. Our technicians are more than happy to assist you further. Chat Support is available 24X7.  For additional support and updates regarding your product, please follow us at @SamsungSupport on Twitter or like our page at [...]  Thank you for choosing Samsung products.  Sincerely, Subham
the seller is a cheat he phone is too expansive with nothing new except for some minor tweeks in hardware and software not worth upgrading frome note 3 to note 4
There's a known boot loop issue that LG is not willing to deal with. Avoid this phone.
empty content  the package arrived without content and I need to know how to retrieve the product or my money or if I was just scammed. please i need answer.  thanks
Absolutely appalling service. Shocked, horrified and upset. I expected far better! Completely disappointed and let down.  Disgusting treatment from this seller for a worthless piece of crap that cost me more money than I could afford to lose. Was sold this device with the guarantee of a one-year manufacturer's warranty. (Unrelated to the store's and Amazon's 30-day warranty) Phone started malfunctioning slightly, shortly after the 30 days were up. Figured it was too late and hoped the somewhat tolerable malfunctioning would cease. It only got worse. Couldn't turn the phone on or use it at all. Constantly kept freezing, shutting down and rebooting. Won't turn on anymore. Tried contacting the seller for advice on how this should be addressed and what I should do next, regarding the warranty. They gave me a one-line reply telling me 'We can't help you, contact the manufacturer', and linked me to a site that was in Spanish. I don't even speak Spanish. Found the English site. It didn't even work. Tried contacting that centre and every Samsung help centre and repair centre I could find. They ALL told me they can't help, THAT THE SELLER is supposed to help me regarding the manufacturer warranty, regardless of the store warranty. Tried contacting the seller again for help regarding the manufacturer. No reply. Finally got in contact with the proper manufacturers on my own- was then informed that this third party seller was not known or trusted by any official Samsung outlet and that they could not help me because they could not verify that the seller had acquired the device by the proper means. They said the seller could simply have gotten the phones anywhere, anyhow. Am now stuck with a $523.98's worth of useless merchandise and at I am an utter loss as to what I should do now without a phone and unable to immediately buy another one, having spent the money I saved for a phone, on this.
Non-original product - FAIL  I purchased this product last year (August 4th) as a birthday present for my daughter. The product was unpacked few months ago and it started presenting a lot of problems. In my last trip, I went to the Apple Store  and also to One Click Authorized Store from Apple in Miami for assistance because she could not handle her phone any more. After paying a big amount of money between the two stores, they gave me the final answer that they cannot repair it. Their main reason was  that the cellphone have non-originals parts, meaning that the phone was stole or repair without apple's authorization. My main point is that I bought this product trusting that it was an original Apple product, I refuse to continue having this phone due to an irresponsibility from you. At this point I think that the solution will be returning my money, because I am not willing to pay this amount of money for a phone that I am unsure if it is stolen or simply have parts that clearly are not original and are not working properly. I hope you understand my situation and hopefully you give me my money back. I think it is the most fair situation after passing such embarrassment and losing a big amount of money. Please find attached the report from One Click Apple Authorization Store as proof of their investigation
cell phone  bad electronic device, the slot issue for sim card was broken and the screen touch didn't work after 3 months
This phone cover says american sim only will it work in india
bad batteries. cellcow sucks  Bought two of these from cellcow. The batteries just don't work!!! The phones just randomly turn off with full charges.
Large camera assembly not water insulated  The large camera assembly on the back does not have any gasket. Little sweat from your body (my case) or a non fully dry surface can damage the camera, and possibly other components. Many users complained on the web about the camera small light always on, and camera error in the software; i got the same from keeping my phone few minutes on my sweatty shoulder, camera facing down. Phones of this cost should be built with more care.
this is a fake samsung
Faulty product  Purchased this for use outside of the U.S., and after a month of use started having problems with the phone freezing and turning off on it's own. Did factory resets a few times to no avail. Waste of $500.
Bought new, got old  I specifically bought a new one and even paid a little extra to get a new one, but the box I got was unsealed. Also, the battery life is crappy. Lasted no more than 6 hours.
no matter the condition (mine was sold like new and it was awesome)  People should be made aware and LG needs to publicly address this problem: the phone you are about to buy, no matter the condition (mine was sold like new and it was awesome), is overwhelmingly likely to end up with an ever-expanding dead zone on the touchscreen.
Don't buy a Samsung phone!  I liked mine when I first bought it but the last few updates to the software have made it worse each time.  It's now a pain to put it on mute or vibrate; it used to be very easy.  Also, my pictures don't rotate to the proper direction anymore.  I think they are making it worse on purpose to try to make you upgrade to a newer phone.  Samsung sucks!!!!
Horrible Phone --- DO NOT PURCHASE !!!!  LAG-LAG  Typical Crappy plastic samsung phone. The software lags (home button ) and freezes all the time. The battery is not up to par with other smartphones... Its got WIFI problems , only 8gb of user accessible storage,smudging when scrolling and i can go on and on... Its just been a horrible experience for me. Never buying samsung again...
it has i lot of problems no sound no wifi and heavy scratches and i can not refund it caus i sent it to other country  it has i lot of problems no sound no wifi and heavy scratches and i can not refund it caus i sent it to other country
the phone does not  the phone does not work, the cell is refurbished
The phone completely died after 2 months of purchasing. Not worth buying  The price looked good so I bought it for my young sister. The phone worked ok but died after 2 months. It wouldn't turn on or charge. I don't think it was worthy it.
Peace of junk!!! I've bought it in February and it just died in September! 8 months and that's it?! Just avoid this if you can call it a "phone" go with an iPhone or something else... HTC NEVER AGAIN!!!
Keep rebooting not a very gd phone
It looks okay but my son no longer wants it
the phone arrived damaged, does not serve the mic
DEFECTED PRODUCT
many problems  I had many problems with this phone!! I send it back twice and first it worked, but after 3 days, they had the same problems like before. I couldn't charge it and at the end I couldn't turn it on anymore. When I wrote the people, where I bought this phone, they were really nice and i had no problems to give it back. I know many people who have this phone and have no problems with it, but I had a lot of problems and would buy me another one.
ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY!!! NO STARS!!!  This is the worst phone imaginable. The phone rings randomly and only when it wants to so I am constantly missing calls. The same goes for text messages. The ringtones actually change on their own! Immediately I though virus! So I bought virus and malware software after I took it to the shop  sure enough the phone was clean and nobody could figure out a thing. No stars, I want my money back! DO not buy this phone. Samsung has got to make this up to me! After 20 years of staying true to them the f#%&ed me with  this piece of.....
Horrible phone  Horrible phone. Do not buy if you plan on taking it with you running and have it in a pocket or runners belt unless you have it locked with a password. Otherwise it will open a tons of apps and websites as well as text and dial people. I never had this problem with any of my past smartphones. Can't wait until I can upgrade and get something different. Worst phone ever! Also, I dropped this phone once and the screen cracked even with an Otterbox and clear armor shield. Poorly designed and the edge screen does nothing of use. It's just a gimmick.
estafadores, no llego nada.
Not a new phone as described  The charger broke after one month ues. We took the phone to an apple store, they said the phone was registered 3 years ago and it's out of warranty.
Miscellanous files uses up over 3GB of space  Full of bloatware! Miscellanous files uses up over 3GB of space and won't let you move any of it to the SD card. Awful.
Wrong information and terrible service both times it was purchased... Great phone, TERRIBLE Service. DO NOT BUY From.....  First time around I bought this phone on random selection for the Seller. According to the title of this phone it's Factory Unlocked, it is not specified as an international model in the title or the description. Only way to know that it is international is by researching the model number or looking more closely at what each individual seller description is.  The first phone I got was from FGS Trading, I didn't know it was international until after I received the phone and when it turned on, it was in Mandarin. I had to google and youtube a video in order to walk me through setting the phone into English, imagine the hassle. I contacted this Seller about the issue, also that the phone was not syncing with my computer because the ID Hardware was not identifiable. The Seller refused to take back the phone without charging me extra and finally after almost 2 months of debating the issue with the seller, through Amazon's A-to-Z Claim I ended up getting a full refund. Tom is the name of the customer service agent from FGS who I spoke to and demonstrated over the exchange of 30 + emails that he clearly is not fit for customer service. For him, his company is always right and I was the airhead who didn't do my research into this phone.  THE SELLER does not follow their 100% money back guarantee unless they are forced to and their customer service is lacking, if they were competent it would not have taken nearly 2 months to resolve the issue. This seller also does not offer return labels for the assurance that an item can be shipped back to them, they only provide an address. You have to pay for your own shipping, insurance and signature on the package just to make sure the Seller gets back their phone. **Buyer beware, if you purchase an international model SAMSUNG USA will not cover this phone under their warranties. In order for me to get any service on this phone I would have had to send it all the way back to Hong Kong. The Seller does not provide you with this information. All they cared about and clearly demonstrated was that they got their money so they no longer need you or positive feedback. In one of the email exchanges from the Sellers' agent, he told me that MOST CONSUMERS KNOW this phone is international and that they are happy with the phone they received and since I am unhappy/unsatisfied/clueless its my own fault because I did not do my research. Does that mean that those who posted similar reviews are clueless as well??? :(  Now here's the kicker, I re-purchased this phone because I have wanted it for a really long time, BUT since I did not want to run into the same problem, I did my purchase with Amazon customer service on the phone.  Now, the Amazon agent was not aware that this phone was international either. World Wide Distribuitors did not have it labeled or specified as an international phone. I re-bought the phone only because it was assumed to be US Coded. The Amazon agent advised me that it was, otherwise the Seller must disclose that it is international.  BOY!! were we wrong... I did not find out this phone was international until it was already in transit to me. The seller finally responded to my inquires 3 days after I made my purchase to inform me it was international. I immediately contacted the Seller by phone and the customer service person- Juan, who I spoke to was very nice. He told me to simply refuse the package. Aslong as the item remained unopened/unused and still in its original factory shipped form I would get a full refund.  I followed his instructions and anticipated a full refund minus the shipping fee I paid. That did not happen. Upon my second phone contact with the seller, the first agent was not helpful, he informed me that I was subject to a restocking and a return shipping fee. At this point I requested to speak to a supervisor to justify why I was receiving two sets of information and how it was even LEGAL for the Seller to charge those fees.  The supervisors name was Melissa, she was definatley NOT helpful. In fact, this person was unprofessional, rude and very condescending. Melissa informed me 1) my product was subject to a restocking fee and since the item was returned I would have to pay for that cost as well, 2) I could not contest it because it was a company policy clearly listed on Amazon's website and 3) Even if I filed an A-to-Z claim it would be denied immediately because the policies they have are all Amazon pre-approved. This person was snarky, rude and beyond tolerable. Melissa even refused to give me any company information in order to file a BBB claim. When I told them I would take the matter back to Amazon, she told me she would be happy to transfer me to Amazon customer service so that I can hear Amazon tell me that my refund request would be denied since I obviously needed to hear it from two sources.  Two weeks have gone by since my purchase from World Wide and Amazon granted me a full refund since I refused this package. Amazon also gave me a promotional gift in the amount of the original shipping fee for the trouble I have encountered with the Seller. I have also submitted a BBB claim against this Seller and my complaint can be viewed publicly. So I suppose, in the end, Melissa, if you see this post, you were wrong.  It's a shame really. I have wanted this phone for a long time and finally saved up enough to get it. Times are hard, cash is not expendable for most consumers and this purchase was a luxury item purchase for me. I never expected to get so much trouble. When I did have the phone, it was a wonderful experience since I had never had something before that could do so much. It played movies, music, took wonderful pictures, writing instead of using the qwerty board to text was awesome. I really love this phone but I will not sign a contract to have it :(.... Too bad that all the factory unlocked are international models.
Phone came with a broke SIM card slot was charged more to fix it than what I paid. The charger isn't original as stated. Dont buy.
Worst experience ever  Hi guys! I bought this cell phone a few months ago and it has been a complete nightmare. It says It's unlocked but I contacted with HTC support and it says it was anufactured to operate on AT&T networks in the United States. For this reason I can't update my Operative system that works in my country and with my operator. to fix the problems that came since the phone was new. It's been a horrible experiencie use this device. I'd like a solition for this inconvinient asap.
Faulty Battery  Phone battery arrived defective. Phone would die at random intervals when stating that the battery percentage is very significantly charged. Upon plugging it into the charger after it dying it would immediately restart and turn on to whatever percentage it died on. The percentage was never under 5% it was typically around 30% or higher. Also, the battery would drain and die within max two hours of a full charge while being on low battery mode as well. On top of this the charger that was sent with the device is not Apple compatible so it would not even register on the device. Therefore, it would not charge it.
This is a beautiful phone but I had to return it  This is a beautiful phone but I had to return it; it was a phone that has been reported stolen according to my carrier.
Stolen!  The phone was scratched and when I put my SIM card in the phone it didn't work. I was told by my carrier tmob after they looked up the IMEI number that it didn't work because the phone was stolen and could not be used under any circumstances.
Yazmin  This seller is a scammer. Well offers Galaxy note GT N7100 2 And upon receiving the phone is another reference which does not help. And he refuses to answer. It's not a star deserves.
Horrible experience  I hated it the moment I got it. Got the phone 15 months ago brand new. The battery never lasted over 4 hours screen on time. Gradually, I accepted the fact this is a big screen phone and it's normal. Fast track to now, the battery got worse and worse after every update. Few days ago, the battery died at 30%. I couldn't turn it on even plugged into the wall charger. There's something genuinely wrong with the phone and I strongly suggest do not buy this phone.
Both Iphones doesn't work.  Both devices do not charge the battery. When I took them for a Iplaca I was informed that these devices had been registered in 2010! I bought them in January 2013! So both are out of warranty! But I bought them in 2013! Now I lost $ 400 and I was with two Iphones 3 that never worked.
Watch out for problems just after your warranty expires. Google doesn't care!  I just want to say that I rarely write reviews but I felt like I should as a warning to anyone that buys Google Nexus phones or any other Google phones. I really liked this smartphone and I have had many smartphones ever since 2007. I bought this phone near the end of March 2016. My Nexus 6p has had a screen protective and case since I got it. I have been very careful with it and always updated the phone with all of the OTA security updates and official Android updates. After downloading the July 2017 OTA update, I had something weird happen. The loudspeaker on Nexus 6P would not work if I tried using it on speakerphone. It will still play ringtones, music, audio from videos on Youtube, etc. The only thing that it will not do is speakerphone which is a feature that I use a lot. I contacted Google support and was trying to troubleshoot the phone for over 2 hours which only consisted of doing a Factory Data Reset. I had to backup my videos, photos, etc on my phone. What Google support didn't tell me is that I would lose all my text messages that were on the phone. This should have been something they told me before I did a factory data wipe. I thought that the Google backup would include my text messages but whatever. After over 2 hours, the data reset did nothing to fix my problem. They told me that since I didn't buy the phone directly from Google that they could no longer help me. It seems that Google only stands behind their products if and only if you buy them directly from Google. They promised me that Huawei would be able to help me as Google has "excellent manufacturers" that stand behind their product. This was an absolute lie. Huawei had the worst customer support that I have ever called. The representative from Huawei was very rude and said that they could do nothing as I was out of my factory warranty range (remember that I bought this phone around the 28th of March 2016. My warranty has barely expired and they offered no help. They couldn't even tell me if the OTA update caused the issue with my phone. They could not tell me where to buy parts for my Nexus 6p even though Huawei is the manufacturer of the phone. I was floored by this fact. Customer support wouldn't even suggest where I could take the phone for help. My overall conclusion is this: Please do not buy Google branded smartphones and do not buy Huawei products. They will not stand behind their products and will not help you solve your issues with their products. I have been a fan of Android based smartphones for a long time but I think an Apple smartphone will be in my future. Shame on Google and Shame on Huawei. You will not get my business anymore. Your reluctance to help your loyal customers is very disappointing. It seems you have gotten to the point where your customers are not your priority. The all mighty dollar is all you care about. If you have read my review, please share it with others to prevent them from facing the same fate. Thank you for reading this review.
screen problem, LG service is very bad!  I bought nexus 5, about 50 days ago from google play store online. Three days later, I accidentally dropped the phone from only two feet high on flat plastic tile (it fell off fron my y-sherts poket when I pick up somting) but the screen glass shattered. I called google to explain them, the google representative transfer phone to LG company. They charged $170 to replace the screen which is half of new phone price.  I received the phone two weeks later. The phone is not receiving signal from T-mobile sometimes received one or two bar of low signal but that was E or H signal which is very slow, not even 3G, 4G nor LTE. I did not get any signals indoor at all. I called LG service again to explain, they told me to return the phone again to their service center with provided return label which was not overnight service it was Fedex ground service. I have to wait another two weeks to received my cellphone back.  Two weeks later I received phone back from LG but it was same condition. I seems they did not even looked at it. it did not received any strong or fast signal from t-mobile. I called LG again, they told me same thing like two weeks ago. "Send it back to LG".  I bought nexus5 I used it for three days, I could not used my phone for more than a month now. LG seems not care, they will send me another ground shipping label to send it back, I have to wait another two weeks. I will never buy LG product again. it broke very easily and their service is very bad.  One more, even if evrythig fine, you can not see the screen horizentally while you are wearing sunglases. You can see only black screen untill you turn it to vertical position!!!
broken screen  bought this as a continuum to my galaxy . my old phone was so ruggedly used without a cover. sadly, I overestimated this new product, its the bad sheep of the galaxy family and the screen broke with the first fall it faced! My old Galaxy had at the most a dent with similar fall.  replacement of the not original screen is 170$ min!! not happy at all :'(
IMEI Blocked  Hi,  I bought this phone, but after a year and a half my IMEI got blocked by Orange.  Can someone please help me with that?  Thank you.  Raphael
it stoped working.
Do NOT buy the LIE  Neither Verizon nor Samsung will truly stand behind this phone! Do not believe the ad that says it is water RESISTANT for up to 3 ft for 30 minutes. Accidently dropped one in 1 inch of water for 2 seconds and it does not work. Neither Verizon nor Samsung will stand behind this phone and replace it for free. If the phone were truly Water RESISTANT as the ads and paperwork state it should have survived this accident! Does not charge and is glitching. This phone was in an OtterBox case and the USB port cover was secure and back on. Had the phone 3 weeks. Verry Angry!!
Bootloop piece of junk  Broke exactly one month past a year, so no warranty fix...I will never buy another LG product...poor customer support for an obvious defect in this phone...
Amazon sell junk  The product that I bought on Amazon for $307 + tax  was a piece of junk .the speaker phone never worked and the calls are terrible because of the phone's bad connection. Amazon is turning like eBay ,selling junk with only big profits in mind
It looks like the iPhone 2  Why are people so obsessed with this phone? It's beyond hideous .. I disagree with the $$$$$ ... This is my own opinion
Would give 0 if I could. Dead in less than a year  I really liked this phone and always recommended windows phone to anyone who hated slow android or did not want to be in apple club. I used it gently, never dropped not a single scratch and even did not peel the film that came on the screen. Unlike other users I was aware of lean apps market for Windows phone and it was not a surprise for me either. The only complain was that the phone was not easy to charge, sometimes it acted weird on my attempts to charge it and was very picky on charger device itself. One day, in less than a year, the phone simply died. All attempts: soft reset/hard reset did not result in getting the phone alive. I was able to connect the phone to the computer via Nokia Suite in order to download pictures./video and other data, but it was too late, since I did the hard reset prior to connecting to the PC and it erased all the memory. No memory recovery software helped to recover the data, since Windows phone uses proprietary system that is very closed. Being able to connect to the PC and read some data (IMEI, stock pictures etc.) indicates that either the screen, I/O or some sort of controller that is responsible for screen and I/O went bad. After my last suspicion was the battery, which , after opening the case and checking on with voltmeter, seemed to be ok yielding 3.6 V. It is sad that brand new looking phone now is sitting on my countertop with no use. This was my first and LAST NOKIA Windows phone that I will ever drop any money for. Regardless now what they produce and how advanced the product I will not spend a dime on it for the rest of my life, unless I get it as a gift. Now, as much as I did not want to go back to Android, looks like I have no choice.  save yourself a headache DON'T waste the money and buy this phone or if you do, make sure at least all your valuable data is synced with the cloud.
DEFECTIVE!!!  Phone came scratched on the back when it was suppose to be "new", battery charges to 100% but only lasts 3-4 hours AT MOST, phone randomly shuts off, unable to make phone calls without using speaker- people can't hear me- muffled voice. Never had I had an issue with ordering a phone until now. Completely disappointed. Will NOT EVER Buy from this company again
Good function, but not for the screen  Even though this is one of the best Android mobile phones in the market, with very nice set of functions, and good performance,  unfortunately, it has an easily breakable glass screen. Yes, it is a very nice looking, but too fragile for a mobile phone. I have used many phones, and normally it drops off, slips off from time to time, and I never had any a major issue with any phone. My new Galaxy Note 2 was dropped on the floor, from no more than 50cm height, and the screen was totally smashed like a low quality watch face. After a little search for a solution ( phone calls, & online), I was really surprised, when i found that it was a common problem with Galaxy Note, and Galaxy S3, even with a protection case.  The company should recognize that customers purchase hardware for the service they get, handheld devices are expected to drop often, so the designers should consider this fact. or at least provide a protection case or a rubber frame for free in the box ( which will cost them less than $1).  I gave only two stars, because the value of all nice functions will be of less value if i need to use the device with special extra care,worrying not to break it all the time,  or if I need to pay extra for the expensive repair(s), then the price will be too high for these functions.  This is like, having an excellent expensive meal, while you have to stand on one leg to eat it.
It looks good, but the software is awful  Returned it as it acted up already during setup. Screen started running, it would not call my own (2nd) number but connected without a problem to a  friend's phone. Rebooting numerous times did not help either. It looks good, but the software is awful. Ended up buying another iPhone.
It does not work with Verizon
JUNK products are sold by this vendor.  I have purchased new i phone 3gs from this wireless provider as a gift to my friend and latter realised its not working. The worst part even if you report this the wireless provider would n't care for replacing the device or refunding your money. Shows 100% functional on the web site --its a lie.
unsatisfied  poor quality. .. awful sound.. battery doesn't stay charged long at all.
Waste of time it is defective .....I want a refund
Bad experience  This phone has presented a lot of problems, it dosen't have wifi avialable and the microphone dosen't work. We have to use it in speaker. It is not a good item
Not to my expectations  Phone screen keep freezing , sometimes I want to review a text and won't let me open it , I have to shut phone off and back on to start all over again. Don't know what to do with it

Phone doesn't work indoors......wall charger never worked.....  If you are going to sell a new phone, make sure it is actually new.....
Not good for Samsung users  This is a rough transition from my Galaxy Note7 (which was the best phone of all time). It is slower, the camera isn't nearly as good, and worst of all it does not work nicely with Verizon. I continually have to reboot the phone to get it to recognize the 4G LTE signal. Even when all settings are correct, it periodically disconnects from the towers without warning.  Then of course no one can reach me.  I will just go buy a phone from Verizon now because this is unusable.
I didn't know this was a go phone from att, if I known that,  I hadn't buy it, is not what I expected.
This phone does NOT work with Virgin Mobile as stated in the answered questions.  This is NOT an unlocked phone!!!!
not for US market  after i bought and received the phones (two of them that i got for a hefty price) i was told by three different cell phone dealers that the phone could not be activated and did not appear to be sold for the U.S. market. all three of them were convinced they would only work overseas. that was not listed anywhere in the description and i was very upset. the phone itself (although never activated) seemed like a nice phone. i loved the size and weight of it. i would have loved to be able to use it!
I loved this phone  I loved this phone, but eventually it crapped out on me and would constantly give me voice command prompts. I had to throw it away.
Everything is looking good but the battery life is just 71 percent. Disappointed. Never buy here again.
Was sold as unlocked 32g, received was 16g locked
turns itself off  A very good phone, connection fast, an excellent size, especially for viewing websites. Allows sharing of a simple, fast and fluid.  The downside of this device is that suddenly goes off, to turn it back on you have to perform a soft reset.
Nokia lumia 900 not detecting SIM in india.....not sure why .....I installed micro SIM but not working...Can any one suggest ..  Nokia lumia 900 not detecting SIM in india.....not sure why .....I installed micro SIM but not working...Can any one suggest ..
The phone is ok. It came with the LED not working, so....
WORST SERVICE EVER  I received the phone and it did not even work properly. The part where you charge the phone was not working so I couldn.t charge it. Sent it back to be replaced and they sent me another phone that was defective. I emailed them complaining and when I sent it back, it got lost in the post office. Now this company will not email me back because they got to keep my money and do not care at all. Now I am in the process of filing a claim with the post office. This company sucks! I will never make the mistake again of getting a phone off of amazon. Worst experience I've ever had!!!! Do not look into this company because all they care about is getting good reviews when they don't even live up to their expectations.
Stopped charging after one week. Not impressed.
I am so disappointed the phone cost $229  I purchase this phone on the 6th June,2017 and the phone turn off and never went back on. I took it to the repair shop and they advised me that the phone have a system error problem that cannot be repaired. I need a return on my item or my monies back. I am so disappointed the phone cost $229.99 and didn't even last for 6 month. thanks for your kind assistance in this matter
It has the WORST battery ever!!!!!!!
It does not work.  The phone does not work, it stopped working, it was hung many times, I think it has a defect and it has stopped working.
Fraud  The connection was broken so I took it to Samsung Official Dealer in Mumbai and they told me the device was not new as I bought. It was 1 1/2 year old. An almost perfect fraud. Lukely I got my money back soon
It is a good product but the glass of the camera arrived broken
GARBAGE  It said it was unlocked, apparently not completely, been trying for weeks to get it working with all the  functions. It keeps saying the sim card isn't working. Thinking about returning it. Not at all happy.
I bought an Iphone 5S but I can not use ...  I bought an Ip<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Apple-iPhone-5s-Unlocked-Cellphone-32-GB-Space-Gray/dp/B00F3J4KYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Apple iPhone 5s Unlocked Cellphone, 32 GB, Space Gray</a>hone 5S but I can not use because it is locked in product specifications it indicates that it is unlocked.
I couldn't get Internet no matter wat plan I took..it's unlock but with some limit place on it
Didn't work Right. Issue with the soundm
Very bad,  don't work
If group messaging is important to you then DON'T buy this phone, it is not capable of doing it. If someone create a group messaging and you reply to it? only the sender will receive your text. I don't know why Huawei left out this simple features. I called their technical support and confirmed to me that this features doesn't exist on this phone...I am NOT going to buy another Huawei phone or products in the future.
Constantly rebooted, had to return. I was able to buy a refurb model from TMobile which works very well.
EAFD Samsung  Samsung WILL NOT REPAIR THIS PHONE IN THE UNITED STATES. and yet their online support will constantly refer you to a local repair center who will then tell you they only repair carrier-branded devices. I get it's the "international version" (despite being the same internally as the US version), but they wouldn't even tell me where I could ship it to overseas to get it repaired.  Worst customer service ever and I want to GIVE THEM MONEY lol. Not looking for a warranty repair, I broke my phone and am owning up to it, and they won't help me at all to get it fixed. Just amazes me.
The hotspot is blocked. You can not share internet from my mobile phone
An Awful Buy  When I received the phone it would not remain on for more than about an hour at a time- always went to a blank screen and refused to turn on again unless plugged in... was told that there was an error with the unlocking programme used on the phone however the company could not resolve the issue...
boost and other networks This is totally unacceptable to be ripped off like this  i am extremely diasappointed with this purchase ,when i bought i told the seller i wanted factory unlocked thats why i was willing to pay so much money for the phone and now i find out i was scammed as this phone will not work on sprint,verizon,boost and other networks This is totally unacceptable to be ripped off like this
The phone was not unlocked as described.
very bad phone
Doesnt work have funny charger, a waste of time and money
Nice build of phone and great sound, but Camera quality too poor  Good phone for sound, but the Mifavor UI has horrible usability issues. The Settings are scattered all over the place. I couldn't get the notification LED to flash when I received text messages, which was CRAZY. On top of it all, the front and rear cameras had really really bad quality. I originally had the HTC one, which has a front 2MP camera and it had better quality than the Axon 7's advertised 8MP front camera. The poor quality of the camera is not worth the 400 bucks.
Disappointed  I bought this cell like a gift for my mom she live in other country and the battery exploded one moths after, I don't know if the phone have a warranty but I cant get this phone, I'm very disappointed, btw I bought 2 and the other one is working very good
It was a used discontinue phone with some damage what did not work properly. I had to return it.
DO NOT BUY manufacturer build error - no longer being made!  This was bought as a Christmas gift in in December. Once it was opened and activated, I noticed right away that the camera was 41mpx, which I thought meant it would be soooo much better, unfortunately it sucked. I couldn't zoom in on anything close up with out the picture being blurry. After less than a month it started having problems. The battery would not hold a charge. It would be plugged in for 8+ hours, then after being off the charger for less than 2 hours with minimal use the battery was already half gone. This happened every day for several weeks before it was brought to a Microsoft store. After looking my phone over the technician told me there was a manufacturing error with the phone and that many other people had reported the same issue. Not all of them had the problem, but it was a problem none the less and they had stopped making this model altogether because of it. Since it was a manufacturing problem she offered to replace my phone with any phone they had in the store completely free of charge. So I got a lumia 835 and am really happy with my choice. So far I haven't had any issues, but we'll see.
The worst purchase I've ever made  I bought this phone and we have never been able to make it work properly, it's frustrating that they sale the product with such low quality. If you are thinking on buying this model, I highly recommend you to think it over and reconsider to buy another model because in my case was literally a waste of money.
Expensive but not working right  it is not working properly. The hand free palm control motion is not response. Factory unlocked? but in Brasil version
DO NOT BUY. Not worth it. Microphone doesn't work and the screen is coming up in the corner. Definitely not good/excellent condition. Completely dissatisfied!
<script>alert('good morning :) ')</script>
software malo.
) SGH-1747 with a crappy ROM to fake i9300  Its was announced as i9300, but on reality was a refurbished(?) SGH-1747 with a crappy ROM to fake i9300. Don't buy it!
Malfunction  Bought the Note 2 in Dec 2012.  And on June 20th I charged the phone and came back it was "off". Tried to turn it on and NOTHING. Cant reboot do nothing with it. Oh and my phone in GSM International and from the UK. SO I can mail it to them but they CANT mail it back to me. And Samsung US cant fix it because yeah its from the UK. So by Samsung never in my life will I buy a product from them again. Buy at your own risks. If you look up Galaxy S2, S3 Note 2 online you will see that 95% of their owners got the same problem.
The add inform that the equipment is unlocked, but my AT&T sim card didn't work in it.
Bought phone as present for a relation in Africa and after 3 days of use broke down. Spent extra to have it fixed since it will cost more to have it returned
Do not buy this or any other cell phones from amazon.  This was not "new" as described and the screen fell off after 6 months.  I was blatantly misrepresented and overall a piece of junk.  I can not believe Amazon lies about the condition and sells junk.  Beware!!!
This phone come broken
... after one week of use this is a really bad used product and it say is  it break down after one week of use this is a really bad used product and it say is new
Warranty Issues...  Be warned...  There is no warranty on at least some of these phones.  HTC claims my phone was purchased almost a year before I actually purchased it, and HTC wants an original receipt that includes the IMEI and Serial Numbers, none of which are provided with purchase, so even though the phone was technically OEM "new",  it is apparently  being re-sold as a new phone.  I will change this review to 5 stars if HTC/seller resolves this issue, since the phone, when working, is quite good, but the warranty problems are a deal breaker.
Sudden death in one year :(  Incredible device with one year lifespan. I used it really carefully during one year and a month, and phone shutted down, while a listed tracks in google music. Can anyone tell me please, where shoud/could i send it for repair? Thanks in advance.
Worst phone ever!  I have had this phone for less than 9 months now and its worst phone ever. I had LG-G2 earlier that worked very nice for almost 2 yrs. So I went ahead and bought this G4 phone. It could be only from this seller or all unlocked G4 phones or just G4 in general, but battery is worst. From first day of usage, battery used to drain out in less than 2 days without any data or wireless. I kept it at bare minimum to just test it out. As soon as I started wireless, battery started to drain out in less than a day and with LTE ON, it started to drain from 100% to 15% in just 4 hrs. I had to almost keep it in charge almost every hour of day at work just so my phone doesnt suddenly turn off. Today, June 1 (less than 9 months from purchase), phone suddenly turned off and won't start anymore. It just shows 'LG Life's Good' logo and stays that way. I am now on my way to contact Amazon and then seller, if needed to see what can be done with this. I am really hoping someone would fix it.
Clunky to use, very limited in what one can do.  If you're going to use only Apple downloads and apps, and not use Audible or anything else that isn't bought from Apple, then this phone might be okay.  However, Apple discriminates against products not bought from the iTunes store.  For example, an audio book bought from iTunes can be backed up to the iTunes library on one's PC.  Not so with an Audible book downloaded with the Audible app.  So far, I have not found any way to back it up into the iTunes audiobook library on my PC.  In addition, Apple seems to use my cellular data on a daily basis to upload about half a megabyte (think of a 100,000 word term paper's worth of data) daily, even when I have turned off push notifications, Siri, location services, and just about everything else.  The only thing that stops this upload is turning off wifi and cellular data.  So much for  having a "smartphone"!  Then there's the matter of "garbage collection".  When one loads something onto the phone and later deletes it, the storage doesn't seem to become available.  One has to back up the phone and restore it in order to have that storage amount available again.  And, then there are the bugs.  Sometimes the backup and restore fails to restore the photo album.  Other times, it fails to restore the ringtones.  And, if you manage to change the setting for manually dealing with music, a restore might try to load all your audiobooks onto the iPhone.  The only thing that gets this to stop may be to restore to factory settings, and then to manually add back everything.
Poor quality of phone! I'm not recommending this seller
dow
Now the phone can't go on speaker the charger isn't working and the least little thing its getting hot like its on fire  If I could give a minus zero I would. This phone was supposed to be a certified tested and refurbish phone that I bought for my finance to take home to Jamaica. The person who puck up the phone didn't check to see if it was working OK. Now the phone can't go on speaker the charger isn't working and the least little thing its getting hot like its on fire. Am so so disappointed especially now that the phone is in another country and I won't get to send it back for my almost $400 USD this pisses me off.
Don't waste your money! Cheap AT$T Go phone...Not Unlocked!  First off...This phone is not Unlocked...I had to go online and buy an unlock code for $20....The description is misleading... it's a cheap At$T Go phone...The phone does not work with Wifi nor with the 4G SERVICE..I can make phone calls...That is about it...I will be bringing it in to my phone provider to give the benefit of the doubt...Maybe it needs to be programmed...Usually if you use a phone with the wifi on...it just works...this phone is slow...when the wifi is working.....The 4G does not work at all..You can buy the phone at Walmart for $79.99...Very disappointed... emailed seller yesterday about it being "unlocked" have not heard back yet!
DO NOT BUY  worst phone ive ever had. ordered black. got maroon? power button was broke, charger was broke, battery died at 60% or randomly and would die when taking a picture. sounded like I was calling a fax machine anytime I made a call or would just end my call randomly. disconnected from a strong wifi just would turn itself off. I could go on and on with this POS phone. never again!
This phone was absolutely phenomenal for the first year. Now it has weird battery drain issues, shuts off before it gets to battery saver level, and will drop cell network service to 0 bars at random kicking me out to a lock screen.  Very frustrating when I need to drive somewhere and have gmaps going.  Very unreliable! Friend with same phone purchased elsewhere with a different provider had same issues as me.  He sent it in through Huawei's support, got it back weeks later, issues came back within 24hrs of receiving. Typing out this review dropped my battery from 23% to 15%.  Just skip this one.
bad sim card reader  would not read sim card consistently, intermittent reading. Apple said it had to be returned for repair. BEWARE of THIS SELLER
I liked
Not unlocked phone.  Its NOT unlocked phone, does not work with carriers other than ATnT. I have gifted the phone to my sister and she is disappointed with it, does not work with other networks.
Stay Away. Poor speaker sound,  Speaker is POOR. Barely hearable. No matter the features you would miss the calls due to audio or speaker problem.
the phone came with battery failure
good camera, about it...  It's a strong 2, I got it for the camera. It's works very well. Windows sucks real bad compared to Android. To bad they can't put out a product like Android.
GPS did not work, even though the phone said the hardware was online it could never get a lock on the satellites. Phone would also lose cell connection every few minutes, making it impossible to place a call and causing text messages to go undelivered. Picture messages routinely took 10 minutes to send, even when the connection was good. The built in Samsung browser is also not usable with the latest OS updates because the webpage will hang when loading until you kill it (this was a problem with my S5 as well).  On the plus side the phone was much faster than previous versions and the camera is excellent and fast, the UI works just like any other Galaxy.
Phone arrive with marks of use Often phone just switch off.
not practical  The screen is not bright enough in a sunny day. Cannot see anything even at full brightness. Too big for my pocket, it almost bends when i sit. Battery life is horrible. If i get sweat touch won't work. After a full dry I have to restart phone. Phone gets too hot while talkibg or charging or playing anything.
Phone was not new though what I bought was supposedly new, and has died just after 4 months.
Nice big phone  Nice big phone . However only after a few days it was freezing up when I would try to text . It would send every letter word by word without letting me complete the text 0 stars do not buy
Stay away  Dont buy from this dealer. Phone worked fine for two months and suddenly the screen went blank. Item was returned and given only a partial refund with $120.00 + charged for "restocking fee". My suggestion find a different source to access this phone.
This phone is a refurbished phone  The phone is not new phone but refurbished or assembled personally. First,the IMEI shows in system is different with the IMEI  shows in SIM card slot. I definitely believe  it's not a healthy phone.
Disappointed much!  2nd Amazon purchase that I got an item that doesn't fall in the 'new' category as advertised. The dirt at the ear speaker is quite visible and missing apps that are always pre-installed on  windows phones are not there.  Disappointed much!!!
NOT UNLOCKED  2 stars because i bought 2 and 1 worked. both were advertised as unlocked and to put it simply one is still locked.
I wouldn't buy this phone  But gets way too hot and then shuts down even if you were only on it for like a couple of minutes.
Not unlocked probably stolen  This phone was not unlocked and when I went to activate it was interrogated because they believed it to be stolen and obviously not able to activate it. I'd give less stars if I could. This is crazy.
Terrible phone, has no service would not let make texts or calls out. Totally useless, waste of money. Never buy from this seller again.
Worst camera I've had on a phone  I'm not going to lay out all the goods and bads but if a great camera is your top priority as it was for me DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!  It's auto focus is a joke and if you need to take pictures with the flash be prepared for a 2 second delay between hitting the button and taking the shot. Which I suppose really doesn't matter because if your subject is moving at all it will be blurry no matter what.   I switched from an iPhone 4 hoping this phone would be more durable and take better photos. It is neither. Photos are terrible and one drop knocked the battery out and dented it...while it was in a hard case. So dissapointing!!!
I no longer recommend this phone.  Tried to contact support but they were almost no help. The consultant did not speak clear English and we played email tag for almost a week and now I have stopped receiving replies. Avoid ZTE like the plague until they figure themselves out as a company.  Not sure where to begin with this since every other review seems to have covered most of it. So I will start with some history, I am coming from an LG G3 which I bought brand new on release. I imagine most of you are aware of this phone and how great it was. But it was time for an upgrade and I wasn't really feeling the flagship price anymore and I was stuck between this and the OnePlus 3.  Here's what MY deciding factors were. - Front facing speakers -Hifi audio -Rear finger print scanner -Capacitive buttons instead of on-screen -USB 3.0/expandable storage  The only things the OP3 has on is.. -Higher quality display -Better camera -More ram -OPEN BOOTLOADER  My biggest issue is the lack of XDA support, seriously ZTE? This is an Android you need to have an open bootloader. I was only okay with this since I am hoping it will come in the future and that the stock firmware isn't that bad.  8/24/17 Update  I don't like the phone anymore. The headphone jack has almost completely quit working. There is a weird issue with the camera where it actually vibrates within the housing making it completely unusable when it tries to focus. It has slowed down significantly as well.  10/26/17 Update  Fingerprint scanner has now kicked the bucket and no longer is recognized by the phone.
the phone is great. But can't get Samsung to register it IN THE US
Phone was decent until we found out the camera was not functioning.  Tried to warranty the phones and found out that reseller was shipping Chinese versions so there isn't any warranty at all.
it has been less than 7 months and the mobile broke down, the software is down and an expert working in LG told me it's a manufacturing defect, i am very disappointed the first time to buy a mobile from here and definitely the last. i lost all of my memories and i am without a phone now. really bad experience
Doesn't come with original charger or headphones. I wish I could return it but I'm traveling out of the country and do not have the time or the patience to deal with this.
Untrustworthy seller. Cheating.  Seller Cheated. The phone is not working (the buttons are not working). Total rip-off. Stopped working after one month, so can't return it. This is total Cheating.
I sent this phone back. I purchased it based on the description of the phone, and Samsung described this phone as NFC capable bu  I sent this phone back. I purchased it based on the description of the phone, and Samsung described this phone as NFC capable but this phone is NOT NFC capable.
Don't waste your money!  I liked the phone at first until it just stopped working all of a sudden.  LED screen went black after only 4 months!  I purchased this phone brand new (not refurbished).  I sent it to Samsung who returned it to me a month later with a note saying it was "unrepairable".  I lost ALL my photos, messages, etc.  Don't waste your money!!!
False charger, earphone and cable  After sometime questioning the originality of the acessories, cause they simply didn't work on the regular plug, I went to the technical assistence near my house, and I founded out that all the acessories were fake.
It only last 17 months. It has hardwork problems. Stuck with Google. Imposible to repair
2G phone heads up  I over paid my phone bill for several months before I realized that this phone was 2G n my plan was 3G
Be careful!  Be careful from this seller - "Gadget Negotiators" The unit doesn't  work ("no service") and no corporation from the seller.
It does not work
Didn't last a year  I bought this phone 8 months ago.  It worked excellent for about 6 months. However, for the past 2 months it has been freezing up.  In the interest of full disclosure I'll say that the phone has been dropped a few times, but then again so have my other phones which lasted at least a couple of years. I think that for the price I paid I should have at least gotten two years out of it.  I am still an absolute Samsung fan. I just bought an S5 for my son and I have an S6.
When I first ordered the phone I was very happy of the condition and satisfied until I started using it. The phone kept freezing and had to be restarted like 3 times a day. VERY ANNOYING !!!!! I like LG products but this LG G2 I'll never own as a backup phone either! Taking my business to Samsung and SONY phones now !!! Crap phone !!!
It get in sudden death  I bought two s4 mini and bouth get in sudden death.
Don't think you will want this phone (zero stars if possible)  I just got it today and for whatever reason, it wouldn't work. I turn on the phone then set it up then after I got done with that I tried to update the software then it got stuck in a long boot loop then it just didn't turn on after that. I did all the troubleshooting I could find online but none worked. Then I went to LG customer service and they are completely useless. So I'm having Amazon just send me a replacement since I can get it faster than what LG tried to offer me (which was to just send them the phone and wait for a couple of weeks for it to be fix, like really?). It's crazy how phone companies expect you to buy a $500+ phone and be okay with it not working. With Samsung have exploding phones and IPhones just not turning on I honestly getting confused on what choice do I really have for a quality phone. What happened to having pride for your product? I'm just hoping that I just got  a defective phone and the replacement will be better. If not I'm just going for a refund and staying far from LG products.  (Edit) The 2nd phone was a bust as well don't buy this phone. BUYER BEWARE!!
do not buy used  it broke in less than 90 days...what a scam...do not buy used
The problems have gotten so bad now that the phone is pretty much useless  I began using this phone in June. In late July it started randomly turning off, and it wouldn't turn back on for several hours. This began happening more and more often. Now, in September, the phone has also began crashing while I am using apps. Music playback doesn't work. I've tried rebooting it and that doesn't seem to work. The problems have gotten so bad now that the phone is pretty much useless. I am very dissatisfied with my purchase.
It is soo fake so i didint buy it
Galaxy Note II  Do not buy phones from these people I bought one and it was reported stolen from someone so just letting you all know.
I HATE THIS PHONE  This phone is consistently loosing connection to my tmobile network and when I connect it to my wireless network it does not work neither. I purchase this product back in November 2014 and I do not think that it should be acting up like these in less than a one of year of purchase. My phone is supposed to be an international unlock version and I still can not update to the new android software.
overheated  Worked for 3 hours. Overheated and never turned on again. I returned it in less than a day
Battery not keeping charge after 7 days of use.  Battery not keeping charge after 7 days of use. I was told I would have to replace the battery
phone out of warranty  Your store sold an old, damaged phone that is out of warranty. We reached out to Samsung and they informed us that the phone was clearly not brand new, out of warranty, and likely had unauthorized repairs prior to it being sold Per IMEI number our system is showing that the device as having a production date of 03/28/2015 and that it went out of warranty as of 06/30/2016. That means that the device couldn't have been brand new at the time of your purchase.
No model Number provided  The reason is that it has very ,limited LTE/4G.
Not the best  Reasons why I don't recommend: 1. Battery life is subpar, and the battery isn't removable. 2. Has issues with the micro usb charging port (and I've heard this from others, so it's not just me). It won't quick charge anymore, and it's really finicky about what cord will even charge it. Then if I do find a cord that charges it, I need to push it in just right and not touch it or it will stop charging. Super loose connection. 3. You can tap the screen to bring the phone out of sleep without pushing a button, but this isn't a good thing. Too many times I've had the phone activate itself in my pocket and make phone calls or open apps. Not cool. 4. Phone crashes sometimes and restarts itself for no particular reason.  In addition, the speakers that were so widely praised aren't even that great. I've heard a lot of other phones with smaller speakers (that don't increase their height) that have sounded just as good and we're just as loud or even louder.  Another feature that was widely praised was the fancy all metal construction. Sure, it looks good, but what good is all that fancy aluminum when you put a case on it that covers everything?
Dont trust google.  I've had this phone for 3 years now. Bought it brand new from Google. I have never dropped it or abused itAfter. exactly 2 years (the magic number because then it's time for a new phone!) The internet stopped working, and would come back momentarily and not often. My service provider said it is the phone and not them.  You cannot save a contact. You have to go through Gmail and put it into a contacts list there to be saved to your phone.  They really want you to use Gmail and have everything connected and eliminate internet anonymity. This is the perfect big brother phone where you can be spied upon by Google.  I find it nearly impossible to delete pictures I don't want.
Cell was in different langisht and not enoght memory said i was getting a 16 gb and it seems is 8 gbs. Not happy
Do Not Buy from HERE  This phone should have been great. It actually was great for the first few months. The phone appeared to come brand new but I am now having heavy suspicions. It has almost been a year since I ordered this phone. Within the first 3 months the MicroSD card reader no longer worked. Then I had to replace the battery (not a really big deal). But now, after one year, I am having to replace the entire phone because I have the screen fade/flicker issue! (search for "lg g3 screen fade or flicker").. After researching I see that this screen fade/flicker is a common problem on these G3s. But the issue seems to usually come after a few years of usage - not after one year. This is pathetic. And the phone here is way overpriced. Do yourself a favor and look for a brand new LG G5 on Ebay for $10 more or get a new G3 for $130.
I would not recommend this phone  Phone started shutting off randomly after 13 months. Nexus blames Google and Google blames Nexus. Lots of troubleshooting hasn't helped. I would not recommend this phone.
BAD QUALITY (broke)  The phone was broke. The screen wouldn't work. So I had to get a refund.
Don't Purchase Iphone - jailbreak faulty and don't work  I would not recommend this product from them.  I brought the phone  and the jailbreak is defective and most of the system functions don't work and i want money back.  I tried to contact the seller but to no avail, he hasn't even called back.  The charging port don't work, the sms message don't work the phone was a total waste of my money.  Do not buy this phone or any other device that from them it will be faulty just like mine and this will be no satisfaction. I am also very disappointed with amazon for not dealing with this matter.  They have also been removing my comments about this phone and not dealing with the matter.
is a Bad product  this is the worst phone i could have purchase, within 3 months of buying it the power button stop working,  with the case on and without falling the back screen cracked everything they said in the product reviewed  is not  true all my expectations. i do not recommend any one to buy this phone period. and the sad part is that i will not get any refundo or recompense me for my money lost..
slow
battery was not gud taking so much time for charging. Got the piece with glass broken nd noticed after opened the package
Phone good, build sucks  The phone itself is great. The build is terrible and the screen has broken on me twice, with case and screen protector.
I was very very disappointed. Amazon set out to solve  4 months and lasted only phone died, definitely. No possibility of recovery. Erased, turned off and never called. In touch with the seller, the answer was negative for Exchange. I was very very disappointed. Amazon set out to solve, but this seller.
Defective unit..
device BootLoop  device BootLoop
item did not match descriprion  Item arrived is an AT&T locked phone so I couldn't use it
This iPhone s so defective the button to lock it does not work properly, the sound was really bad, and when I dropped it and the screen cracked I went to go get it fixed and the guy said that the phone had had several repairs before and that there was even tape in where the battery was, he even showed us the tape on my phone. This was the worst buy ever, I do not know how this vendor is still selling when the products are low quality and crappy. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR !!!!1
Wrong item supply  Item arived is second hand but order was for new . Please check the order and supply new not second hand.
Got a used one though ordered for New  This is totally frustating as though I have paid for the new one and extra shipping cost it arrived at me as a used one which is contradictory with the add heading.  Now I have wait without any cell because of this rubbish.
these phones are crap. Avoid them like the plague  these phones are crap. Avoid them like the plague. I have had two hard ware failures out of three phones. Only buy this phone if you like replacing it every two months.
The phone is suddenly down after 3-4 month of purchased. We called Apple store and found out the phone was refurbished but with lower quality. Don't purchase any phone here since no warranted unless you can repair that.
It looks great, but doesn't work well. Shows an error
Item is not what it says, it specifically says unlocked, but is locked under Verizon. If you don't have a Verizon sim this phone will not work, simple as that
Sticks
Terrible terrible phone.  Came with the weirdest glitches.  Can't even use it.  Sending back.  Don't buy!!!!
Not working Its keep shutting and when i charge it its been too hot Very poor phone . . .
Came as a pre-paid phone and was not able to activate under my Verizon account
I didn't received the right item.
I was in love with it  So, I got this phone for the first time last September. I was in love with it, the camera is sooo nice and it was working great. Except less than a month after, the screen split in half and I could not see half of my screen. I was still under the return policy with Amazon so I got it replaced. I've had my replacement since October, so 6 months now. I thought that the screen mishap was just a rare thing. But, just a couple of days ago, my phone just died and been unresponsive since then. If you google that, you'll soon realize that it seems to be a common problem with this phone. I can't take it to my phone provider cause I didn't purchase the phone through them. I've called LG, but since it's the international phone, they won't help. When I called Amazon they directed me to the seller of the phone, who responded by telling me that they couldn't do anything about it. So, I just have a dead phone and no way to get it fixed or replaced. So, my advice is to not get this phone or make sure that it has warranty because you'll probably need it since it seems to break down after a couple of months.
Broken Phone  I bought this phone 3 months ago. Initially I didn't use any sim card to use as a Phone, I only used wi fi to access some web sites. Today I took this phone to a pre-paid Phone company to insert a sim card, couldn't activate the phone. The phone has some software problem, can't fix it. Now I'm stuck with it, can't use it, can't return it.
The camera have issues with the focus. Sometimes after restart the cellphone don't start.
just make sure the descriptions is correct  the ad said unlocked, but it was only for t-mobile I use these phones for my business and I needed unlocked for any provider
the unit that I receive have a problem on the display
Not real happy about it  Phone wouldn't charge, still trying to get it returned so we can get it taken care of. Not real happy about it.
Cheaper at Apple.com  Apple.com has an unlocked 16GB iPhone 4S for $649.00, why would I pay $736.92 from WorldWide Distributors?  Check out the Apple Store, choose iPhone, scroll down and choose unlocked.
Do not buy, this phone never worked, would not connect to wifi and no data.
Very disappointing that this version does not apply to the US LG Promotion (Free Battery + 32GB + Desktop charger). I bought it on June 30. They should have published this information...
It is a rubbish phone. I lost my money.
My phone stopped working and the store did not give me any support.
Mostly junk  Phone had many operating errors that could not be fixed even after taking it to Apple....iMessage didn't work, time could not be adjusted and all apps were lost when phone was turned off and back on.
Estafadores  compr un Samsung Galaxy S4 mini y me enviaron un protector solar. son unos falta de respeto. Estafadores. Ladrones
TERRIBLE PHONES, I WONDER IF IT WAS AN ORIGINAL SAMSUNG PHONE  I bought two very bad phones, One phone is very slow, and the other one just stopped working after two months of use, it doesn't turn on.
Seller is scam... iPhone sold as new but appears to be sold in Japan in 2016 and is therefore out of warranty. AVOID!
purchase of New Samsung Galazy S Captivate  I purchased on amazon.com what was suppose to be a New Samsung Galaxy S Captivate. when i received the phone it had bad blemishes and the entire rubber door covering the charging port was missing. There was NOTHING NEW about this phone.  I feel that the description and price online is misleading to munipulate me, the customer into a purchase.
software not updated on phone  The phone does not have installed the latest software. I had to do a lot of time consuming research to figure out how to update the phone.
Phone was working fine for 2 months, then I updated blinkfeed and it crashed  The phone did not show any issues up until 2 months of usage. I updated blinkfeed and it crashed making the phone useless. Then I did a factory reset but then WiFi and Bluetooth stopped working. I was in the technical chat support for 3 hours and they said that I have to go to my region technical support since I happen to be in Europe at this time. My region technical support said that they can't do anything since the phone has an IMEI number from the US so now the phone is completely useless
is sucks
Stinks!  Junk.  Stay away.  I loved my Nexus 5 and recently tried to return my Nexus 5x only to be told its outside 15 days so I am stuck with it.  From day 1, this thing is slow and often freezes -- especially when an app tries to access the Camera.  I am going to go back to my Nexus 5 and sell this junk on Craigslist.  Pros : Camera is decent but i am coming from an awful camera on the Nexus 5 Fingerprint reader is speedy.  Cons : Slow Slow Slow Slow Locks up for 2min and reboots when apps access the camera. ( Folks on the internet indicate there is a hardware flaw and a patch won't be coming) Battery life -- struggle to get through a full day of use. Phone body is slippery - Nexus 5 had a more tactile feel with a grippy back.
I like the phone but it didn't come with SIM cards and it's hard to find one for this phone.
NOT FULLY UNLOCKED (ONLY usabled for Southeast Asian SIM)  I just got this phone, expecting it to be usable in every country if SIM card of that country was used. (I am currently living in US). But the package of what I got clearly says "Southeast Asian SIM Card ONLY". I am so upset and disappointed right now... It also took about a week to be delivered to me. I am thinking of returning it.
That's a s***..... Don't buy
Loved it, until it broke down after 11 months!! Contacted the seller (US Wireless) for warranty, said that they only have a 3 month warranty. When I asked about the 1-year warranty they told me that's the "manufacturer's" warranty. So I contacted HTC, they said since you bought the device from a third-party seller on amazon.com and the device has been manufactured more than a year ago, your device is out of warranty!! Surprised at first but then decided to ship the device to the HTC repair center. Their diagnosis: Pay $200 and we will fix it. Why? because it's out of warranty. What's wrong with it? It's out of warranty. That was their only response "It's out of warranty". I guess everything they fix is for $200 no matter what the problem is.  HTC is dead to me and I will never buy another device from them ever again.
has problems syncing with cpu through usb cabel.
I received my iphone in the expected time however the battery charge battery lasts no more a charged one hour standby time.
Two units, both lasted only about a year.  I have had two of these and both of them broke after about a year. GPS started to have issues, than the devices got overheated and eventually they would be loosing too much power. I've tried new batteries with no luck. One wouldn't turn on at all, the other one wouldn't have cellphone reception at all. I will not buy another of these. It maybe the GPS that is causing these problems and overheats the device.
Phone overheated!!!  This phone is okay, has all the features I wanted and more.  However after 3 months it became very hot and as a result one of the sims slot is not functioning.  I was very disappointed and went back to using a cheap dual sim china phone which give no problems.  Have to give it a one star!!
Bad Screen, the pink line  Bad Screen, the pink line, the seller did not give me a solution, Now i se this S7 edge with that screen error
I bought this phone on Jan 7, 2016. This was my first phone and I was really excited because it looked so cool. I was happy with my purchase for the first few weeks but then I started noticing the battery draining really quickly. This was a new phone and I was already disabling apps that I can't uninstall and don't need and using power saving mode, airplane mode, etc. I charge it to 100% and after 10 min use its already 90%. Really disappointed with the battery life.
Stay Away  I received the device on time that's the only positive. The phone was completely defective, the speaker was in horrible condition it sounded like I was talking under water, really muffled. And I'd place a call and the only way I can be heard is if I'm on speaker. The charger didn't work and the battery drained way to quick and believe me I adjusted all my settings. I have to charge it 3 times a day not kidding.
Waste of time  This phone was supposed to come unlocked and it did not. What a waste of money, pain in the ass, and on top of that this could be call fraud because the item is not what it was described as.
DISAPPOINTED:  INTERNATIONAL SIM CARD DID/DOES NOT FIT IN SAMSUNG's SIM SLOT.  I AM REALLY SORRY THAT MY SIM CARD DID NOT FIT THE SLOT.  MY SIM CARD IS LARGE AND THE SIII SLOT IS FOR A SMALL SIZE SIM CARD.  ALSO, THE PACKAGE ONLY INCLUDES A UK ADAPTOR, NO OTHER ADAPTERS, LIKE FOR U. S. OR EUROPE.  I EMAILED THE SELLER AND REQUESTED A REPLACEMENT SIII THAT WOULD FIT MY SIM CARD.  THEY REPLIED FOR ME TO CALL FOR TECH. SERVICE TO FIX MY PROBLEM.  I HOPE THAT I CAN HAVE A SMALLER SIM CARD MADE TO FIT THE SLOT BY MY CELL PHONE SERVICE PROVIDER.  THE SIII DOES APPEAR TO BE A GREAT PHONE.  I HOPE THAT I CAN GET THE SIM CARD PROBLEM RESOLVED.
Good
Battery doesn't last much at all
bad battery an abuse
The phone didn't work since I bought it. I brought it to bring it to my family in Argentina and it started to reboot  constantly and after a week it stopped working. Don't buy it!
Great phone, while it lasts  The LG g4 has a great camera, nice interface and great features, but it doesn't last. I bought the phone in July of 2015 and 16 months later the phone died. Took it to a repair shop and they told me that the motherboard of the phone was dead and needed to be replaced. It is disappointing to pay nearly $500 for a piece of electronics with such a short lifespan. Beware! If you intend on using this phone for more than a year, I'd consider buying a different phone.
Not bad
I used to love this phone  Horrrrrible and laggy and it was used....I used to love this phone...I know this was a used model..
Camera is not a good as the original Mega.
Short battery life and deficiency  Battery life is short and battery had to be replaced in 4 months.  A few months after purchase charging port on phone stopped working.  Battery would not charge when phone was plugged in.  Used another cord to test:  confirmed that it was the phone port and not the cord. I won't recommend this product.
False advertisement, however you will get an iPhone
Worst 400$ purchase of my life  Worst 400$ purchase of my life. When I got this phone it was already broken. The speakers didn't work. When I went to get them fixed by Apple they said the entire phone was fake, including the serial number. The only real item on it was the colored back. Not only that, but it was supposed to be new and apple told me it was 2 years old. I am tempted to never trust this company or this website because of this incident.
SCAM!!!  SCAM!!!
Google doesn't support their product  Do not Buy!  Avoid this model.... It pains me to write this review.  This has been my favorite phone ever. You will experience battery issues. My phone shuts off randomly after it drops below 90%.  Unless you want to pry apart your phone and replace it or spend $90 getting it replaced at a repair shop.  If you buy from anywhere other than the Google Store, Google will not help or advance replace your phone like they used to due to "policy changes". They will just tell you to take it up with Huawei.  Huawei does not care.
bought in 2015 and thought what an amazing phone, really no issues with GSM sim  bought in 2015 and thought what an amazing phone, really no issues with GSM sim. Now a year and half later my phone quit & finding out it is in fact a locked phone with Sprint and CDMA network , illegally unlocked and now completely usless to me, well I guess the camera & apps work sad
The does not stay in charge ,please advise.
Phone was great until digitizer issues showed up twice.  It's a pitty. I really liked this phone, but sadly the two I purchased had digitizer issues (one had a dead spot, the other ghost touches). I have read this is a common problem with LG G2's.  If I had time I'd keep trying until I got a good one, but I'm going to be trying a Samsung Galaxy S5 instead; slightly more expensive but it has a removable battery and SD card.
el telefono  vino bloquedo pide el pin  para desbloquearlo  por favor enviarme el codigo  el mismo comprado en phone zone
Got this in July 2016. It began turning off on it's own Dec 2016. Jan 2017 it turned off and won't come back on. This barely lasted 6 months.
WORST. PHONE. EVER.  This is the worst smartphone I have ever owned, bar none.  I was excited to buy hardware directly from google, given their (mostly) sterling reputation for innovation and design. Most of all, I was excited by the lack of carrier-installed bloatware. However, the shortcomings of this phone have eclipsed all its pleasing features. The worst thing about this phone is its USB-C charge port. This is the worst connector ever invented. What was wrong with the micro USB connector used by EVERY OTHER android phone? The latching mechanism on the USB-C port is so weak and frail that it failed almost immediately, and no USB-C cable (I've tried a variety of mfgrs) will latch into the port. I routinely set the phone on a charger and then come back to find it completely dead. This is a crippling flaw for a device that I depend on for my livelihood. I have literally been late for commitments because the charging cable fell out of the phone while I was asleep.  This phone is also huge. It does not fit comfortably in any pocket except for that of a winter jacket. It is very difficult to operate this device one handed. Also, the battery performance was never good, but after about a year it won't even go 12 hours on a full charge, a problem none of my previous smartphones have ever had.  Here is a short list of the Pros and Cons  Pros: It takes great pictures No carrier bloatware Early android updates  Cons: Too big to use one handed Chintzy charging port Accessories not stocked in stores Chargers unavailable in convenience stores (If you travel a lot this is enough reason to skip this product) Poor battery life Uncomfortable to carry  To buy a $500 phone and encounter these basic flaws was severely disheartening and my confidence in Google's hardware has taken a nosedive. I will need significant convincing to ever spend my hard-earned on another piece of google hardware. Do yourself a favor and buy an iPhone or something if you want to spend over $500 on a disappointment. After getting ripped off on this level, I will never spend more than $500 on a phone again.
stuck in loop mode, garbadge
Its Fake... Disapointed  Fake Galaxy S6 plastic phone, 600$ wasted! Getting a refund!
worse buy ever  worse buy ever....i must say  delivery was  on time, packaging was great. presentation of the phone was fairly good although not too fond of the camera, battery life was adequate.  anyways after about 6 months after purchase i noticed that my notepad  was going off on it own it randomly types ,  selects, send calls and messages on its own!! how annoying that must be. i thought it was an external issue had the hone wiped problem persisted.  now 8 months later i am unable to use the phone any at all. was a waste of my money and the seller has increased the cost too!!
Not working. Returned
The phone didn't last two months And died Bad bad
I placed the order then learned that the Edge of the phone is used for quick access to some functions and is not recommended for  I ordered this phone before I knew what the "Edge" word in the description referred to.  I placed the order then learned that the Edge of the phone is used for quick access to some functions and is not recommended for seniors with arthritis; which is my case.  I tried to cancel the order but it had been shipped and I was charged a 10 % restocking fee even though I sent the package back unopened.
Muy pirata el telfono  Muy pirata el telfono
Slow charge!  Camera is good. But it's not fast charging.
Bought for my granddaughter and she was unimpressed, on front face camera was her biggest complaint
Bought as a Christmas Gift in December 2017. Phone suddenly goes blank on 4/23/18 and am told a "Brand New" phone need a new motherboard.
Does not work  I bought This device one month and half ago, but when I received it and took the phone to my country to try go connected it was unsuccessful because the phone did not take the cell phone company never , even thou I took the phone to different places trying to know if there were a way to solve that problem they just can't do any thing 4 the device .. I feel so angry and uncomfortable with this result because this iPhone was suppose to be my father gift, but I could not be.. I had never gave a complaint for anything but in this case I thing that it is necessary ..
Was a big disappointment..  Was a big disappointment....could not be set to receive texts or texts with pictures.  Had to send it back.  Felt badly because I really wanted to have a Galaxy phone.
Unassigned phone  This was my first time to buy electronics via Internet verses store. The Phone was labeled as new. I could not get to work so took phone professional. This phone appears to be a dud
This phone sucks  This phone doesn't work, as soon as I turned it on, the screen started to turn off (not the phone, just the screen) when it turns back on the screen is locked, when I unlock it it turns off again! UUUGGGHHH!!! It's impossible to use it.  I always expected to buy this phone, now I know why I've never bought an LG phone, it is the worst thing ever!!!
return it
Disappointed  This phone worked great for me on T-mobiles network and then one day, just stopped working on the network. Hadn't been dropped, or experienced moisture, or anything. This phone was babied. I won't be buying unlocked international phones anymore. They won't work on the US LTE networks anyway.
Issues with International verison  This does not have warranty even after spending nearly 750 US $. The screen now has some manufacturing defect which shows lines on screen. And I don't know if Samsung will replace the screen
Utter Rubbish  1 star is generous but zero is not an option. First out-of-the-box the charger that was supplied with the phone, doesn't actually charge the phone and after a few uses in became very obvious that the battery needs to be replaced as it doesn't hold a charge. You have to be either constantly plugged in or enjoy the 15 minutes of freedom a full battery will give you. Be careful as you really don't know what you are getting!
Do not waste your time and money!!!  I bought this phone because I had a Samsung Galaxy  s3 before and really loved it, just wanted to have a smaller Galaxy and was very disappointed, it overheats and drains the battery, freezes and reboots every moment. I was able to return it next day.
DEFECTIVE  This product stopped working in less then two months. I brought it in to a technician and they checked a bunch of things on it. The conclusion was that it was a DEFECTIVE item. When I plugged it in the logo only came on then it shut off. When I unplugged it. It completely shut off. The battery was over halfway charged. The charger that came with my phone did not work on it either. I got my full refund for this item through Amazon since I bought it with my store card. I never will buy an item that is not sold by Amazon EVER AGAIN!
Camera and led not working  The cameras and the led don't work,  I send it to LG for warranty and they tell me the warranty don't cover that, because the problem was "water"  on the components,  I never drop it in water or anything  else.  This phone cost me like $400 for all the shippings and taxes from Guatemala to USA,  I'm not recommend this.
verizon phone can not use any place no card
while the seller has made efforts to send a phone that meets my needs I now have 2 phones that are "broken"  neither work.  the first one doesn't accept or read cellular data information, the second does not recognize a sim card when inserted.  These are not factory unlocked new phones.  They may have been new locked phones and are now "broken" in order to sell as unlocked.  I have wasted a lot of time trying to get a good unlocked new phone.
Did not give accurate info about the size of the sim that works.
Producto this Informacin  oodnight I need more information on products they buy where and when will I receive agradesco information that I do not feel satisfied with the service thanks and sorry if recommended
this is bad
PHONE NOT AUTHENTIC SAMSUNG PRODUCT. INVALID IMEI  NUMBERS  This Phone is NOT an authentic  SAMSUNG phone.  I Bought my phone  in January  2016.  Been having some problems  with it so  I called  Samsung to get some trouble  shooting help. The technician asked for the IMEI,  which turned out to be invalid.  So I'm  stuck with a phone that won't  even power up.
Didn't work...  Never works. Finished in a  non oficial repair office.................................. Very dissopinted. This is my first bad experinece buying with Amazon
Returning non working item  Phone tuned on but wouldnt stay charged and turned off within min which if it was tested prior to shipping like it says in the description the seller would not have sent this phone. I started the return process and ordered another phone from different seller.
it's not unlocked like the ad states  I just got the phone.....it's not unlocked like the ad states. This an AT&T phone and I am not an AT&T subscriber. I am currently under contract with a different provider, so this phone is no good to me. It keeps asking for an AT&T SIM card. I paid for rush delivery. I'll keep you posted on the return policy and process, because that's my next step!
The phone came with problems in the physical and tactile button on the bottom.
Great phone only it is not 4G compatible  Great phone only it is not 4G compatible. If you want 4G you will have to get a different model. Best service level is H+ which is significantly slower than my S4's 4G speed. The phone itself is wonderful though, just beware.
I loved, loved  I loved, loved, loved this phone up until about year and a half later power button failed. Tried everything people on line recommended. Took it a part a few times. Cleaned it and so on.  Nothing works. Phone is practically useless. Apparently, its a very, very common problem of Nexus.  As always, it happened after warranty was up. Disappointed. Never thought I will switch to apple but looks like their product is more reliable. Wife has been using I-phones for years with no problems.
Charger not from Apple  At first when I got this iPhone, I was very happy and everything worked very well. But later, when I was charging my phone, it said that charging was not supported. After comparing this charger to my other Apple charger, I discovered that it was not from Apple, and was fake. I'm very unsatisfied because the seller was not honest.
my LG g4 is dead!  after about a year of use, it went completely dead do not buy here
THE PHONE IS NOT WORKING IS REMANUFACTURADO OFFERED AS  THE PHONE IS NOT WORKING IS REMANUFACTURADO OFFERED AS NEW
I wasn't totally satisfied  No charger to connect the phone,I wasn't totally satisfied
BEWARE failed upgrade  Purchased Axon 7 from off Amazon.  LOVED it upon arrival until it updated to 7.1.1.  Now it does NOT work with Google Play.  Before you purchase, search internet for Axon 7 "waiting for network".  Renders the phone useless and you can NOT go back to previous version of Android.
Pure frustration  I don't know if I should blame this phone or my carrier which is Family Mobile.  The phone will not send any texts to a certain area code.  Samsung support has been non existent, Family Mobile told me to buy a new sim card which accomplished nothing and now after having me waste my money on that,  they claim there are no problems with their service  so I am stuck.  My plan is to put the phone  in the drawer and buy a new phone and I can assure you it will NOT be a Samsung, I am through with them and also to switch carriers.  By the way, if you are thinking of using Family Mobile, you will find their customer service people impossible to understand.  I am looking for a carrier with U.S. based support.
The phone sold to me by E-depot is not genuine s4  i found out that the phone that they sold to me is not a genuine s4. Some of the settings is missing thats why i went to ask help and they found out that the phone is not genuine that's why some of the settings is missing...and one more the phone is lighter than the original one. I want to return it but i don't have time coz im out of the country.
Don't buy, died after 1 yer and 1 month  Died 1 year and 1 month after I bought it, tried everything, sideload OTA, anything I could find, but no luck. And the worst part, since it's past 1 year, I don't even have warranty now. First time this happen to me with a phone, horrible. No more LG. Sucks!
I bought the phone and it was nice but has one problem that my husband did not like. It did turned off and didn't wanna turn on when somebody was calling. So I ruterned the phone. I did ask the seller to send me a new one and they did - but it was the same phone - it even had my baby's picture which we took the first time we used the phone to see the quality of camera - and charger was folded the same way I did it and did not have plastic covers and black cover from front and back of the phone were put there for the second time for sure. But they stil keep telling me it was a new phone. So please buy the phone but NOT from this seller - because the phone is good but service is awfull. And they refunded money but took 10% off the price I paid originaly because they say it was a new phone!!!!
Terrible Customer Service  I placed my order for this phone not realizing it was "Unlocked" and would required a SD card. Shortly after placing my order I emailed the company to cancel my order they insisted that this phone would work for my Verizon account. I had to open up an entirely new Verizon account for the phone. Luckily mine was up anyway. Two days after receiving the phone my touch screen began to glitch. I went to bed and woke up in the morning and the touch screen completely stopped registering any touch. I spent $225 on this phone, $120 to activate it, and another $130 to fix the screen. After bringing this to the attention of the company, they responded with a short, mediocre reply; refusing to accommodate for their terrible services. Then stopped replying to me all together. I didn't ask for a replacement. Only an accommodation for the extra money spent to make the phone functional. I would not recommend anyone to purchase any products that SD wireless has to offer.
Phone took too long to come... and it didn't even work....
Very slow and turns itself off  restarts
where is Cortana?  I bought this phone because it said it had Cortana and I have looked everywhere on the phone and can't find Cortana, will be returning this product if I don't find Cortana
This phone is not as I expected.  This phone is international phone but not USA phone.  I thought it was sell in USA; However, it is ship from China.  The ac charger is too big too fix in USA plug.  The phone is color gray but the ac adaptor is white.  I does not have 4 G for my Tmobile , so it is very slow connection for online.
the original phone package was open and the mobile phone was scratched.
Great phone until into a brick and started bootlooping after 1 year and 3 months.  Great phone until into a brick and started bootlooping after 1 year and 3 months.  Chatted with google fi and they gave me a new replacement even though the old phone was out of warranty.  Now the clock starts ticking on the new phone bootlooping.
3 Strikes and Out  This phone from Open Source Wireless came with a European Plug and instructions in a language other than English. There is an enclosure suggesting calling them if there is a problem, but this is such an obvious inconvenience that it's going back.
THE PHONE IS NOT GREAT QUALITY  I received this phone on 12/26 and accidentally dropped it on 12/29 and it broke.  I didn't drop it on a concrete ground, simply on a laminate floor and it broke!  So I'm not sure how the phone itself works because I really didn't have a chance to use it.  I have always been "old school" when it comes to certain things and the phone is one.  A thicker phone, no matter how outdated, you can drop a million times and it still works. It was cute, though.
I ordered this for my son for Christmas.  I didn't realize it was an international phone that could not be registered in the USA. now we are waiting for a refund, before we can order another one.
It has many damage on it. If I know it has many damage I didn't spent more than 180$ for it.
me vendieron un galaxy s5 mini con fallas de fabrica y no me lo quieren cambiar  I sold a galaxy s5 mini to start charging the battery the display will turn colors, the phone is not 4g but policy amazon can not ask for a replacement despite being almost unused, never again buy a product by this store, nor by amazon should have a consideration to the customer when a product fails factory
marginal  device performs much below expectations. The only reason i keep using this phone is because of the larger screen I need which no other phone in the US can offer. Aside from that there is not much to admire about. Instead recurrent problems include,  Rotate screen frequently does not work which can be very annoying at times when it is most useful (i.e. during gps driving, the screen failed to rotate many times, which forced me to rotate the car mounter instead).  The two window feature also confusing and sometimes does not seem to work. It s got pen but I don't use it anyways.  Video and still pics taken by care automatically uploads to google+ without any warning and by default which is a security concern for me. So far I haven't found a way to disable it, the setting does not offer to disable this. Not sure if there is a trick around if I research it online. In either case, it sucks that they did not make this effortless.
The iPhone 5S may (or may not) be a decent product. The one I bought from Apple years ago has been great. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AGAINST buying any product from the Amazon supplier "Clean electric" however. Clean electric sold me this phone represented as "New." In reality, I learned that Apple had originally sold the phone in 2014 and the product was, therefore, out of warranty. Unfortunately, I waited longer than 90 days to begin using the phone and didn't discover that it was defective until it was too late to write a scathing review for Clean electric. DO NOT BUT product from CLEAN ELECTRIC.
I got this phone on 4/19/2016.  It suddenly die on 6/1/2016 while it was idle. Last use was around noon time, then I left on the table. Not able to turn  on again since 6 PM.
Was in great shape. It will not work completely  I would barely give it one star. The phone arrived on time. Was in great shape. It will not work completely. It freezes, stops working, has to be shut off and restated constantly. One of the biggest waste of money I have made on Amazon. A complete joke!
This Iphone is not original.  I bought 2 Iphones on the same date and they both stopped to work on the same week. I went to an Apple store in Brazil for warranty and they told me that this Iphone is false. There is no serial number. Don't buy this. Now, I want my money back. See what you going to do with this. It past just 2 months and I want my money. I want a RMA to send these back to US. There is no serial number on the Iphone
Lie  The phone was locked even though it was clearly stated that it was not. Can't make calls or messages
Mislead,  false info  According to the mei number it's a m9. Very poor information I received when i got the phone. It said it was an 'unlocked' phone which turns out it wasn't. Said I could choose any carrier I wanted all I had to do was but a SIM card but all that was a lie to.
HTC hardware for headphones sucks. It is a hit or miss.
WAS NOT LIKE I HOPED OF THIS MOBIL  THIS DEVICE ONE DAY SHOUT DOWN AND NEVER MORE FUNCTIONED
Dont buy this product!  Zero starts! I was using my phone and suddenly te screen turned out black and I cant see anything. It does not turn on again. I brought to samsung and they told me this is a FAKE cell phone. What the heck?? They opened a samsung in front of me and they were so different. Im waiting for some exaplanation from the seller and my money back. Dont buy this product!
does not work and no support  I have one of these phones.  Samsung sent me an email to update to the latest OS version and the update crashed the phone.  Samsung says it had to be my fault and I need to pay them.  Samsung will do nothing to to help.  Their customer service is rude and unhelpful.  Now I get to pay for phone srvice with no phone to use, thanks Samsung.  By the way since they make cell phones the BBB does not take complaints.
Falsely advertised  I was careful to read wether or not it came from a carrier. After reading that it did not come from anyone, I decided to purchase it. Upon activaton I find out it's from AT&T. I  was greatly disappointed about this as I am not familiar with their applications. Had I known it was from AT&T, I would not have bought it. There needs to be a way make sure everyone who vends on Amazon fully discloses information such as this.
a waste of  the phone worked only one month and the problem is that it was at a premium of Venezuela a gift, it was a total fiasco and i do not know if it is warranted because the period amazon and return step, a waste of money
it doesn't stay charge long I don't know why
Do not buy this mobile  Buy this mobile exactly 5 months and a day like any other stopped working. Bring it to a repair center and was told that the main board was burned. Research on the internet and it turns out that the Galaxy S3 have a hardware defect, at 5 months were burning main board. I tell them not to buy this mobile, because it has no warranty, and lose their money, as I now have to buy another, and pay only 5 months ago more than 500USD laying burn that has no warranty. If I had, samsung knows the problem and they changed to a new one, but since it does not, just lost my money. Thanks to this sale. Not lose their money, do not buy this mobile.
It's not a good choice.  Not properly unlocked. It doesn't work with any SIM because T-Mobil still block the use in different countries and operators. It's not a good choice.
I don't have a good one so I have nothing to say...
Serious battery issues after a year and half. Phone ...  Serious battery issues 16 months after buying the Nexus 6 phone. Phone shuts down by itself when there is still 50% battery life, unable to turn on unless it's charged for a while, when it's on, battery is 0%!  Called and messaged Google, who did nothing to help. Google referred me to the manufacturer Huawei, Huaiwei says pay $150 to replace the battery. WHY? it's a 16 month old phone! I will never buy or recommend another Google phone again! Never buy any product made by Huawei again!
Done with Apple  I bought this phone a month ago, and now apple is coming out and saying that it puts out updates to slow down older models?? (SE included). It's a month old!!! I didn't buy the phone from amazon, but that doesn't matter; the obsolescence update affects everyone. Stop letting apple bully you into buying new products, like chargers, headphone adapters and new iPhone models.
phone sucks badd, they sent me a fake iphone  phone sucks badd , they sent me a fake iphone :(
Found 5 photos of some Chinese guy on my phone when I got it. Will post all 5 pics. REFERB
Phone is great! LG support is lackluster.  The phone itself is a great value. It works well, especially given the price. There seems to be an issue with this model whereby the phone can get into an endless reboot cycle. The support team indicated to me that this is a known issue which a number of people have encountered. When I attempted to get my phone repaired under warranty, LG told me that the standard turnaround time is 9-14 days. That seems like an unreasonable amount of time for to be without a phone.  Contrast this experience with a mobile provider, which typically can send out a replacement within a day as a warranty repair.  Recommendation: If you want this phone, buy it from your carrier or through Google. It might cost a bit more, but consider what the cost of not having a phone for nearly 2 weeks might be.
... right on it had to go purchase one from best  It was junk nothing worked right on it  had to go purchase one from best buy
and it came as a locked phone i belive this is some down right $^*( ------ disappointed not  scam !!! this s*** isn't unlocked do not buy ! this is my third purchase and the first two came as locked which I CLEARLY KNEW however when the discription on the phone says """" HTC Desire 610 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE....... and it came as a locked phone i belive this is some down right $^*( ------ disappointed not recomended
HTC Uno X con Beats Audio GSM desbloqueado ... HTC  Hello! The iphone does not catch me. What can I do?
buy a new one  broken when it came, paid to repair it,  now its broken beyond repair
Same thing every year  First off I would like to say I only upgraded because At&t gave me a discount on this 5s. Before I had the 5 which I was kinda stuck with. I swear sometimes I forget I got the 5s. Its almost the exact same phone, but slightly faster, and a poorly made finger print scanner. A 64 bit chip? That may some in handy if it had more than 2gb of ram! I swear apple puts out the same phone every year! I'm sick of it so I'm switching to android. If you still love apple there is really no difference between the 5 and 5s. And literally no difference between the 5c and 5
I Don't like it as i take phone on my ear to hear call. its on-screen buttons start working.. sometimes call on hold, sometimes mute, sometimes loudspeaker on during call. I really faded up with this product.
Not truly unlocked phone  Falsely advertised to be unlocked but is actually a Verizon phone that does not perform properly with at&t network
Dissapointed  Ok so I had high hopes on this phone, but it dissapointed me why? 1- my calls somehow drops alot and no it's not my network provider, the person that I'm talking to on the other end all of a sudden does not hear me but I could hear them, I would have to hang up the phone and call back the person or the person would have to call me back.  2-the ring tone is not loud enough, I had cheaper phones with way louder ring tone.  3- the vibrate option on this phone is very weak, sometimes the phone is in my pocket and when its on silent and it vibrates when someone is calling or I'm receiving some sort of notification I don't even feel it.  4-the camera is ok not great.  These are my issues with this phone, I think I would have to buy another phone soon
Camera problem  Received the phone fast. Beautiful phone. But after using the phone for a few days, we noticed that photos were fuzzy. Experimented with it some more and found that the internal lens was "off". Will not take a clear photo. Returning phone.
Phone malfunctions in less than a year  This phone worked fine for a few months but then went haywire in less than a year.  It would just stop working and shut down with no particular rhyme or reason. Tried wiping it clean and starting over but that didn't work either.  I've searched message boards and some other people have the same problem but no solution.  I don't recall seeing the "No Warranty" language when I made the purchase in October 2014.  Seller said there is no One Year Warranty with this phone.  This is not a review of the type of phone in general.  It worked fine in the first few months.  Just make sure you buy it from Google directly so that it will come with a warranty.  11/11/15 Follow Up:  I replaced the battery and that fixed the malfunction problem.  The original battery had swelled up like it was about to burst.  But now, it will not work as a phone due to our TMobile network switching to 4G.  If you are in the US and have 4G coverage, buy a D820 version, not this D821.
Could not talk with it up to your ear for ANYTHING!!! My son still has to talk on speaker when answering or receiving a call.
Stupid get out of business
Unfortunately,  I got a used device...
Old software, old product.  Don't buy this product. The software is old and you will not be able download any apps on it. Anytime I tried to download, it gave a message that I needed a more current version in order to download. What good is an iPhone without apps. I will not recommend this to anyone. Get iPhone 4 or 5 or get a Samsung galaxy instead.
Meh.  I'm not sure about this seller but in real life the phone is pretty great besides the one breaking point. The power button is much lower than any other galaxy so I'm constantly turning my phone off mid text because of where your hands go. Also the phone is horribly weighted so when trying to avoid the button the phone will fall backwards out of your hands constantly.. very frustrating even after a couple of years but the thing is tough so two stars.
The phone isn't holding a charge, and also pictures r taking  to long to send:{
Hate it!  Hate it! Hate it! Hate it!!!!!  What a stupid design! My galaxy S5 has enough useless features to fill days of exploration yet the home button wakes the phone and there's no way to disable this feature. Every time the phone is in my pocket, the home button inadvertently depresses and wake the phone. Soon after the phone rub against my pants and get unlocked. From there to the misdeal phone numbers to the deletion of important info, the way is very short. I guess it's okay, it only cost $700...  I contacted Samsung but they had no help to offer other that going around it by putting a number or pattern lock on the phone. Surly my pants pocket isn't that smart. It's okay for the phone to heat up in my pants and waste battery while the screen is on.  Arrgggghhhhhh! you stupid Samsung software engineers! Who the hell is testing your prototypes? We don't all wear suits like you! most of us are a blue collar working class that put our phone in our pants pocket.  Please revise software to allow us to disable home button from waking phone up.  And NO! I don't wan't to put a code (number, pattern, or unreliable finger print) on my phone. I don't want to see my life waste away on unlocking my phone for every time the screen goes out or with every phone call. I tried it and it suck.  If this is not fixed, this is my last Samsung product. Very disappointing...
I have problems with this product.....i need a warranty
Had all sorts of problems.  Shortly after receiving a few small but tolerable problems started, they progressed until the phone was completely unusable. First, when charging, the phone would randomly stop unless the cable was wiggled. Replaced the cable and it stopped, then returned. Went though about 4 cables before I realized the charging port was bad. Shortly after the 4th cable, the screen started to malfunction, it was subtle at first, but progressively responded to touches less and less. The phone also started turning off at 50% randomly. The phone stopped accepting any touches 3 days after the return window ended.  Bought a Moto g plan for my daughter instead, couldn't be happier.
Awful Caution  Caution. What he sells to you is something that does not work. I opened my "brand new" (purchased thinking it was new not refurbished) iphone and tried to set it up while I was in the car. It told me to hook it up to itunes so I did on my laptop, but it gave me an error. Took it to the apple store and i was notified that it had been wet. That there was a red spot on top of the phone that notifies that it had been tainted with water. I notified the seller and he tried to blame it on me saying that if I had wet it somehow. Like really? I got it and saw it did not work and took it to the apple store, which I was told that I would have to buy a whole new one because this phone does not have warranty in any way not even the 30 day warranty that you should get and he advertises. I would ask the seller questions about the iphone and he was very rude. I asked him if I can have a refund and he said "Well I guess knowing the amazon policies". So if it was up to him he would not refund anything, even though he is selling cheap stuff that does not work at all. It is just a waste of money if you guys go and buy from him.
Dont buy this ohone is pirata not real samsung fake from china
Shipped me a used, rooted phone.  First thing I noticed upon opening the package was that the lens for the camera had been smudged/scuffed. Next thing I noticed was that the box lacked any documentation or instructions, and there was no SIM tray tool. I turned on the phone and immediately noticed that something was wrong with the screen. In the upper right hand corner of the screen, the time and status icons are cut off at the top, as if the black border around the edge of the screen is extending OVER the screen. I tried to open an app on the home screen and was warned that the app would not work because the phone had been rooted.
NOT a Rugged Cell phone  NOT a Rugged Cell phone.  The internal electronics in this phone are very fragile. Even without any external signs of damage you will pay through the nose to fix it.  Neither the Samsung warranty nor the Verizon warranty will cover any repairs.  The Samsung "7" series phones are bad news - avoid.
Pretty okay phone until it literally broke from doing nothing  Pretty okay phone until it literally broke from doing nothing. The lcd display quit working when it was sitting on my bed. Brought it into Cell Phone Repair. They ordered the parts they thought they needed, fixed it, and it still didn't work. They told me to try and send it back for a new one. This happened after the return policy ended. Thanks.
samsung they sent me was not the open international code, they sent me a model of Korea that I could use.  I could not use it.
good afternoon! equipment problems  good afternoon friends I want to meet the problem is happening to me! since just eh RECEIVED equipment and has some problems he seems to have problems with the horns and I can not listen to people who call them my I have not put the phone on speaker and they listen to me I want to know that occurs ! because when I put my headphones if I listen but do not rest!  THANKS and agraderia them to give me a respuestaa see that could be done in this case?
There is a problem while charging  the touch screen responds slowly
Hot phone (literally)  I purchased this phone in March 2017, it is now July 2017 and the phone has completely died. It tuened completely hot and shut down an will not turn back on. I loved this phone in the beginning but really fustrated that there is no contact to the company for questions or repair issues, not to mention Amazon return window closed as of May 2017 (how conveinent) I'm really in need of my phone for my job situation being that I'm a flight attendant and this is our method of contact,
awful  This product is not original, it does not work the air gestural nor any similar applications, I can not update, and nothing that the seller told me if it was. shame that bad, I lost my money ...
Buyer Beware  Receive phone that has gray flicker bar across the top. Upon research it is a known iPhone 6/6Plus issue and they are turning around and reselling them with this issue. So glad it presented immediately so I can return it.
I bought one and it died in 6 months. Totally dead and Apple could not help by phone
False information not 32 gigs.  I want my money back.  Not compatible with my service purchase Provider and its suppose to be.
Check the phone before you sell it.  I bought this phone to work on walmart family mobile (t-mobile) instead of AT&T. Does not support wireless charging like i hoped with the lg g3. The volume down button does not work and it comes with android 5.0.1. I was hoping maybe a software update would fix the issue, but I could not update it to 5.1.1 because i had to be on an AT&T service to recieve their update OTA. this phone can work on tmobile, however, they do not sell the lg g flex 2 so they could not update it. And the screen could have been better.... going back to the LG G Stylo.
box incomplete .....  I received my cellphone. But the box came  WITHOUT headphones. Where are my headphones ???????
Have had it only a little over 6 months and the battery is already dying.
Be careful buying unlocked I phones  Both phones was supposed to be unlocked and they weren't.. Would never buy again
Broken upon receiving.  Shut down minutes after unboxing. Won't stay on for more than a few minutes.
Apple iPhone 3GB  I hated it because it got freezed and stopped working at a point. I had to buy another one. It may not be fault since it wasn't a brand new stuff.
NOT  HAPPY  AT  ALL  HAVE  LOT  PORBLEM  WITH  PHONE CAN  SENT  PIC OR  REVICED  THEM
These are really good phones for the price  These are really good phones for the price. The phone was not unlocked as advertised. I had to go to at&t website and request an unlock code. It took a couple of days to complete.  The phone should have been unlocked as advertised.
Very bad  Not very good the iPhone not work all fusin on china and memory Roo small bad service 100% bad    bad . Teje One month to get the iPhone rely bad  bay everything bad never get for Amazon
The battery died soon and I always have a charger with myself! :(
Battery problems  I purchased two of these in August. Less than two months later the battery in one needs constant charging (Twice a day) and they both have the same apps so its not a problem of apps running down the battery
Horrible Company.  Stay away.  Update:  After 6 months the phone died.  Sent back to Mercate.  After 5 months they have not returned the phone and now no longer even respond to my emails.  They have effectively stolen my phone.  Stay far away from this company.  They take your money and run. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Beautiful piece of hardware!  Bought it for my wife who switched from an iPhone 6.  She loves it and has no regrets.  The Screen and camera are awesome.  Battery life for her is not great, but she keep the screen at full brightness all the time.  Overall very impressed.
arrived with defective screen  when i received the phone i was happy to see what looked to be a good replacement phone, but upon plugging it in found that the screen was defective and would not work despite itunes showing the battery around 80%. there is also a screw missing in the bottom that holds the screen in and i suspect the screen did not work and was repaired but not effectively because it does not turn on. makes me sad to see a product backed by amazon to be shipped in such a state.
Maybe I have a lemon  I have had IPhones for years. I gave up the IPhone 4 for this one and regret it almost every day. The finger print scanner only seems to work for a few hours before I have to input a new phone. I added my daughters and my wife so they could unlock it and none of their finger prints work now either. I add my almost everyday and by the end of the day it will not recognize my finger print.  The keypad is a nightmare. As I said I have had IPhones before. This one is so sensitive (and I have fat fingers) that I can never get a message out without getting a cap rather than an "a" and/or several other mistakes that autocorrect invariably screws up. Never had that problem so regularly on other phones.  I have not had Siri before but it is worthless on my phone. I have used voice recognition programs on my computers and never had problems there so I have a hard time imagining it is my voice but most of the time I cannot get Siri to work well enough to use it.  All in all this phone is a nightmare but maybe it is a lemon.
Bad Purchase from bad seller.  Worst purchase ever, phone was working well for 1 month only, then suddenly while he was IN MY POCKET, i pick it up from my pocket to call somebody, and without no notice, it was shut down, tried turning it on , nothing happend. tried charging nothing happend. It just stopped working, and now i am required to pay 150$ just to fix it. Do not buy from this seller, or buy an LG G4 at all. when i wanted to return back , the return policy was already gone, i remind you the smartphone worked for only about 1 month, it did not fell on the floor nor in water.
Three Stars  This phone was a waste of money. The  phone had a good appearance. First thing I noticed was the poor resolution on screen. Second the camera, poor picture quality. Third the GPS stops working. I compared this phone from Mobile Group USA to a new Samsung from at&t. Mobile Group USA I call and get voice mail no one has returned my call.
It gives me massage "Battery unplugged" and don't charge I have asked at the product page but no body answered so I have request to return it :(
Worst  Request a phone unlocked as indicated in the publication, but both got blocked. One was only I could release but the other did the impossible to do so and to spend almost the same amount of money to release it, I could not. I really lets this because when I found out because I could not unlock, AT & T indicated that the IMEI had been reported. So as you can not sell a phone like this.
very bad quality overall  very bad quality overall, battery only last about 3 hours, it started to have the problem one year since i got this phone, and now it is completely died about 2 years since i bought it.
it has a metal sound in the speaker...  every time you make a call this loud beep beep noise rings in your ear. its annoying  ** well i figure out how to get rid of the beeps every time you dial a number before the call rings in. its in the settings  then goto personal  then goto accessibility  then goto hearing  i clicked on turn of all sounds and it got rid of the annoying beep beep in your ear.  still working on background apps even though you have ended them all in the task manager ram usage they keep running in background.
love this phone  5 stars for the S4 mini duos. love this phone. great features. ZERO stars for the phone that I RECEIVED!!! I was only able to make and receive one call on one of the SIMS. The other Sim never worked, didn't even register on the phone. Phone stopped after 5 mins. Kept getting this message whilst trying to make a call: "Mobile network not available". Returned phone and I am now waiting for my refund.
Phone was locked repeated efforts to correct situation were ignored  Not what was advertised
Do you get a battery when you purchase this phone?
Not Dual Sim  Be careful folks this is not a dual sim phone. It has one sim and the impression for where the other sim should be.  And the phone was bought from amazon. This is a sham.
Item returned.
Did not come with stylus pictured. Now the phone boots continuously and the return window has closed. Piece of crap. And the screen is burned in.
my LG G4 came with an open box and while LG sells this phone with two batteries, mine came with only one which had a broken seal.
Problem phone  Screen started to get a purple color that is turning to black and within 2 hours screen got completely black that I cannot operate and use the phone.  When I took my phone to Telecommunication Ministry office to get it recorded to my passport  Imei number showed that it is recorded as an I phone. As my phone is still under warranty Samsung Service does not accept warranty. This is a brand new phone and I do not know if this screen problem occurred because of a fake Samsung phone or not. Amazon customer service was very pay attention for this problem, at at the and I returned it.
Really bad everything bad
Microphone broke and now I can no longer use my phone as a PHONE. This is a notorious problem and Nokia has done nothing to fix it. Not only that, but the Windows Phone platform just isn't as fluid as it should be at this point. It's honestly buggy and glitchy. I'm going back to Android. Camera is phenomenal, but having one awesome feature doesn't make up for the complete wreck that is windows os.
The phone is not unlocekd and it sucks.  I expected a nice looking unlocked phone but what I received what a bruised unlocked phone. Didn't even realized it was unlocked till I got home and almost my friend because of it.
the phone i received was not "unlocked" but was in fact locked  on the amazon page for this phone it says the phone is "UNLOCKED" BUT THE PHONE THAT I RECEIVED WAS NOT UNLOCKED IT WAS A LOCKED PHONE. there is not doubt this phone i was sent was in fact LOCKED because, after i complained i was offered an unlocking code which i rejected as a solution because 1..it might risk fouling up the phone and 2..it could void the warrantee.
The phone is used phone I bought as new
Does not works as a new one  Charger works with defects, not stable charge. iPhone comes without box charger earphones. Just the cellphone bubble rap.
Pathetic experience !!  I had bought this product last week. The product was delivered on time and everything was all well till the time I gifted this phone to someone and as soon as the person opened the box, started the phone, and started testing out the functionality, we observed that the microphone is not working. Tried a lot of troubleshooting options which were available on the internet and none of them worked. This is such a ridiculous experience, especially when you are gifting this smartphone to someone and the very basic functionality of the phone doesn't seem to work !! Phone heats up quite a lot while charging, you can prepare a mini omllette while the phone is charging... Even the touchscreen doesn't work very well, you have to touch multiple times before it actually acts..  This purchase is such a big disappointment and waste of money!!  I have no idea whether this is an issue with the all HTC phones or only with the ones being shipped by TJ Global.  Fellow Amazon Shoppers, beware !!
Possibly defective  Was a birthday gift, missed return date. Phone worked for two weeks,  FaceTime would not activate. After two weeks, phone would not power on.
Overrated  This phone is a disappointment. Despite the hype about Gorilla Glass 2.0, the display is the easily most fragile I have ever seen on a cell phone (this by itself justifies one star). The battery lasts barely 10 hours under light use. S-voice is essentially useless - it takes three times as long to get it to do anything useful than does Google Voice Search. Samsung support is poor and unresponsive.
Rip off  Not happy at all received the new phone and go to power it on and all it does is turn on and off can't even use the phone at all. Phone looks good but not happy at all
There was original Samsung,  There was original Samsung, table load can damage and was not received by the Samsung in my country as a copy
This phone came in late and turned out to be defective
Do not purchase R-YAs phone. Its disfunctional and the nfc function doesnt work on his.
no galaxy in the box  There is no galaxy inside the inner box.(galaxy box) there was no sticker on the box and the box was opened! what the hell is this??
Refund please, broke down for no good reason after 9 months  It hasn't been a year and this phone broke down, for no good reason it just stopped, I am soo disappointed because I took good care of it, I didn't drop it once and then as I was charging it it  just broke, and its not just the screen the whole thing stopped working, I even contacted Samsung and they couldn't replace it because the cereal number didn't exist on there system, I don't know if this is the sellers fault or just Samsung but 660$ that I paid last year for this was a lot of money for it to brake like that. I wish the seller would at least send a new one or repair this.
becase it have error 1015
It says Factory unlocked. Which means no Carrier logo or app in the phone. I received an AT&T unlocked phones and probably the mobile hotspot will not work on Digicel Haiti. Thank you Amazon for such a lie !!! PAOLO from Haiti.
I ordered 2 unlocked phones,  what I received were 2 locked phones for verizon.  Poor poor I can't even find a rating low enough to match the hoops I had to jump through not including the money spent.
Disappointed with poor connectivity and support.  After the recent 8.1 update the phone is having constant connectivity issues showing "limited" or "no internet" status for WiFi, which blocks pages and apps from loading. Contacted Nokia support - they told me "too bad!" since the phone is out of warranty. I'm not going to consider a windows phone ever again. Microsoft + Nokia deserve the 3% market share, and I'm out.
Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black (Wireless Phone Accessory)  These phones does not work with 3G banded, only connects to the Internet, This is not the S5830L, is the S5830 and is the European version
Didn't work for my Carrier  Claimed to be an worldwide unlocked phone. Not for Verizon. Also the water damage stickers were completely white on both the battery and the phone.
Phone does not work.  Hello: Phones do not work, every second get block when you are the phone. It is hard to keep unblocking the phone to be able to speak on the phone. After a couple of minutes on the phone the line gets disconnected and people thinks I am hanging up.  What can I do please call me at 602-570-5596. Elizabeth
imei bad  Phone was blocked/Stolen I can't even use it has bad imei number
Phone Was Not Factory Unlocked  The phone was locked to At&T only. I had purchased the phone to use on the T-Mobile network. Since the phone was new I tried to unlock the phone through AT&T's website. Since I didn't have the phone on the AT&T network for 6 months they could't unlock the phone for me. Not a problem with their policy but a problem with the person who sold me the phone and said that it was already unlocked. Sheesh, what a waste of my time.
phone I received was USED and DAMAGED  the Iphone I received was USED, but also the lens had a scratch that cost me $35 to fix at the apple store, since ALSO the phone had NO WARRANTY !  Better buy at the Apple store, where they stand by their product with a FULL warranty  and great service !
A junk phone and a bad screen and camera  Sorry but this phone worked fast the first 2 days. Then it started to freeze Started to crash Powering off by itself
Screen damaged  Do not buy it. the screen was damaged, I took it to an apple store and they told me that the screen was fake and that I had to pay for it.
Please read this.  I not have any complaining about the shipping actually was really fast. I only want to said that you lie in your details about the product. Because i recived a refurbish phone and the battery don't work and make it reset every time i open any app. The phone at the 2nd day just totally die. I want my money back.
Phone battery seems to be defective, saying 75% but does not want to come on unless charger is plugged in. Also is not completely unlocked for any GSM network. Really disappointed now got the phone and right out the package and it is defective.
I'm ok with it.. Heats up too much  Hardest thing to update to lollipop. Could only do it by tricking it or rooting it.  Heats up like crazy and only lasts the day if I don't keep my data or WiFi on too much.  The space is ok for me because I back up my stuff automatically and can easily access them when I set important stuff to available offline.  I don't mind that because I always used to that before - constantly saving space.  I enjoy the button being at the back,  makes accidentally locking  the screen harder. Plus it feels better like that. My fingers automatically place where the buttons are anyways so that's good.  Front camera is awful but the back camera is great for its price. Both cameras aren't all that great at night. The auto focus on the camera is annoying I tend to manually do it my self especially when doing a video.  Sometimes when receiving a call the caller complains that they are hearing some kind of interference.. Idk why. So,  idk if it's a manufacturing problem or what.  It's unlocked as stated and I could use it for both the available carriers here in Jamaica.  I too am loving the screen size.  In box: LG g2, USB charge, adapter, an AT&T sim card and booklet.  All in all the bad makes me rate it 2.. If it was already updated to lollipop and didn't heat up so much I'd love it. But most LG phones have a heating problem anyways.
locked iphone  The phone wasdeliverrd to me still locked and we tried every attempt to unlock it without success. Some websites promised some expensive money to open the phone, and that would mean paying another money. It was going to be my son's bday present, so I had to got to a phone store to buy another phone at the last minute. I Felt cheated because I had paid for a phone that could not be opened or used. It just sits here.
I got it very old
I appreciate the phone because I needed one; but the volume is messed up on it;  I miss a lot of call because I can't hear the phone ringing even when the volume is all the way up.  Please advise
Can't listen to music with headphones anymore!  I purchased this phone in May 2014. It was functioning well until the auto screen brightness stopped working about 4 months ago. I thought no big deal. Now I am unable to hear music when I use my headphones. I have two different headphones and none of them work. I can only listen to music without my headphones which is not possible at work. Any advice?
Purchasing directly from Samsung I thought would have eliminated any issues I would have had but this only caused more issues. The only good thing about the phone was that I got a fast charger with it...but I don't know why I would have to charge the phone every minute
Its a bad copy, bad sound, bad colors.
I'm very disappointed in this product  The phone worked for a little over a month then it started acting up and now it has died completely. I'm very disappointed in this product.
The charger and cord did not work. I had to go to tmobile to purchase a new cord after one week of having the phone. While, I didn't want to replace entire one or be without a phone.  There wasn't anyone from Amazon where I could address sending me a new cord from vendor. Since I have used the phone for a month... I find the battery to drain quickly. I also learnt if phone will not restart or turn off you will have to place it in high light to have it turn off.  It's been an everyday new experience.... I wish I stayed with a Samsung phone. The best thing about the phone is I can hear it ring--thanks to Beats as a feature. And here I thought I upgraded.
Sucks. Has lots of problems. Acts like its having a seizure all the time.
THE WORST! Model: SM-G920F Samnsung S6  This phone is no longer alive. It started with restarts once in a while. I bought it in June 2016. And today January 2017 I can't use it no more. It restarts automatically every day... the screen gets frozen... Not good at all.
nice try but no good  So far i have two major issues: (1) poor signal reception rate - whenever i am in a relatively poor signal reception area, I almost instantly lose signals or at least the device's connection become very unstable.  (2) poor camera quality.  I get it.  This is a budget phone with some premium end features but the camera has become a very important aspect in many people's everyday use and yet this is VERY VERY BAD.  Under bright sunlit, this performs NOT BAD but even with a slightly dim condition, the camera starts to perform horribly.  OIS does not save it.  The photos lose detail and get blurry.  These two glaring issues made me hate this phone.  Other minor things - the Hi-Fi feature is actually very confusingly set up.  Hi-Fi Super? Hi-Fi Standard? Dolby?  Also, MiFavor Ui still has a long long long way to go - still feels like a dev device rather than a consumer's - like the Galaxy S3/S4 era.  At this price range, I would consider other options like OnePlus 3 and maybe last year's premium phones if you want great camera while losing some raw horsepower.  This phone has a great screen (on par with Note 5) and great speakers/DACs but other than those, meh.
There are better phones for the price out there  I bought this phone in February of 2017 and it is already malfunctioning. This is not due to physical damage done my be. But rather a design flaw in the phone. After just so much use it will just begin to fail. There are better phones for the price out there. The screen will flicker and fade and eventually just go out. Would not recommend.
Issues. Issues. Issues.  This phone has given me trouble since the very beginning. First the audio had a great amount of static, that problem was partially resolved after a couple of resets. Then the dropped calls started happening, I live in the heart of the city and have never had carrier-related issues with dropped calls. Then finally a few days ago, screen went completely dead. Now, I am back to using an older phone and I have no idea what to do with the phone I purchased. I have never owned an iPhone with so many issues. The earphones fell apart within a couple of days. The box that it came in seemed a bit shady, I am really not sure if the merchandise I received is actually a true out of the box Apple product.
The speaker on and off was really glitchy, I would be busy in office or kitchen and in the middle of a conversation with someone and the speaker function would just turn off.
Microphone was damaged, never worked properly.
BOOTLOOPING PHONE  Phone was great all the way up to when it just didn't turn on anymore. Experiencing the well known "bootloop" issue, and there is nothing I can do about it but buy another phone. $375 spent only to have to replace again with a little over a year of use.
Phone stopped charging or turning on within a few months.
The worst  Well, I need to say that I had the worst experience with the phone I've bought, the accesories weren't originals and the phone was extremely  slow,  the phone looks like it's rebuilt. It was the worst purchase I have made. I have had experiences with Iphone 2 and are much better than this phone 3G acquired. I felt like I throw my money away
Phone died and customer service has ignored my messages.  I loved this phone while it lasted. It's been only a year and it died without notice, can't even repair it. I brought it to a phone repair store and inmediately they told me it probably had an issue with the motherboard, meaning it would be extremely difficult to repair. I lost sensitive information and had no way of retrieving it. Phone doesn't even turn on. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE.
Ive had other Samsung product but this one is my worst buy.  1. Signal drops for half day. 2. Person on the other end of the call cant hear me i have to restart and then wait for 10 mins to make a call again.. 3. Gets really hot one can fry an egg on it.  Ive had other Samsung product but this one is my worst buy.
I'm very upset and disappointed. It's a good phone but It came broken in the bottom. This is the worst service I ever had! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!
Got the phone and was unable to make a call in my own house. Always locking up
Sucks!  My android was better. This phone doesn't have the swipe feature on the key pad nor has a functioning hotspot. The hotspot won't even load. The camera is cool; takes quick, multiple shots. Overall, I'm not satisfied.
Broke  Well, actually it lasted only two days...It slipped off my hands and crashed into the floor...
This product is not as described. When pulling it out of the box you can tell it is a well used phone. It has scratches all over the screen, the back is dirty, it appears that this phone has been used for sometime. The phone does not even look like it is a S4, it looks like it might be a S5 or some other type of phone. Be cautious when purchasing from this seller.
Wrong Description of the phone. The phonenis locked.  The description said the phone was unlocked but the phone was actually locked. I sent the phone to different country abd now have tonpay extra to unlock it. SIM card did not work.
Now I supposed to pay them extra because they make crap  I bought this phone with  2 yr contract. Had it less than a year before the screen started hopping up and down so badly that you had to guess were the actual keys were. I googled flickering screen and LG G2 and found a large number of chats with consumers talking about this problem. It used to happen after the phone was in use for a while but eventually turned into a constant problem. The phone was under warranty so I got a new one. The problem is is that if this one goes wonky I have no recourse other than paying for a brand new phone. Five days after I got my new phone I got an  offer that they would extend the warranty and my new phone for a year for only $93.00. Now I supposed to pay them extra because they make crap phones
What about for my Money I don't see the money and my account for the galaxy  What about for my money I don't see the money and my account for the galaxy
horrible!!! the worst cellphone i ever had.......stop working...freezes its really really slow, do not even have flash..its a nightmare :(
Great phone except for the fact that they sent it from the factory with a charger cord that doesn't work!!! I'm highly dissatisfied with that.
The single worst customer service experience I have ever had  So I found out recently that LG may be the worst company in the world when it comes to customer service.  A known issue rendering the Nexus 5X useless requires the device to be ground shipped to the facility in Texas before a weeks is spent on "diagnosis" before the issue is fixed.  If the part needed to fix the devices is out of stock, they will not alert you the wait time will be much longer, but instead you can obtain this information by calling multiple times and asking to speak to call center supervisors. They will then "escalate" the issue (read as more waiting) before once again letting you know the part will be out of stock and your repair will take longer than expected.  If you call enough times and explain again and again they are asking you to be without a cellphone for over 10% of the year, they will offer you a replacement device. As I use Google Fi as my carrier and they have no unlocked Nexus 5Xs in their facility, this is not very useful.  Instead I had to buy a new phone and requested, what I hope is, the most expensive  device offered so I can sell it on craigslist or something to recoup my losses.  The day after my phone broke my car was totaled in an unrelated incident.  A week ago I had a new car. Today I still do not have a working phone.  Short of refusing to address the known issue (google Nexus 5x stuck in boot mode) or the phone exploding, I cannot image a worse experience.  The phone itself is real cool though and I like it a lot but you may want to get the 32gb model.
Battery issue  It worked nicely for 1 month but from then the battery problem started and the apps are running slow and the speakers are also not proper I think
The phone was great when I first received it but then 2 days later the phone wouldn't charge or come on. I had to return it.
Very disappointed the volume does not work properly have to use the speaker to hear calls and sometimes that does not work right either
Don't waste your money  I have owned android phones for years and this one by far is the most disappointing model I have EVER owned. The battery life is a lie; I maybe get 6 hours out of this without needing to charge it. I had a GO PHONE from ATT that costed 100 something dollars and that battery lasted me 24+ hours without dying. There are so many settings too that sometimes you have to search for what you are looking for. And the amount of bloatware that comes with it is appalling. The only good thing I like is the amount of internal space and speed. It can't even fit in your pocked the screen is unnecessarily large. They know this and even made a mode that lets you type on a smaller resolution screen by shrinking it into the lower corner. I will never buy another samsung phone.
BUYER BEWARE!  At first I liked my phone, but now I can't hear when making or taking calls because there's now sound coming out of the speaker.  The charger that comes with this phone is an international one so it also has a conerter for the US. Unfortunately they're two different colors!  This really sucks.
Two Stars  For some reason this phone didnot hold up nice phone but on and off trouble Sad
Not 4.8 inches as advertised  False advertising.
iphone4 listed is new, but was old and used  i bought 3 iphone4 for a friend of mine living abroad these iphones were listed is new, but they weren't when i received they seemed new, but when my friend opened the box they all looked old and used and they don't work properly Now my friend is stuck with 3 worthless phones I am very disappointed with this purchase!!!!!!  very disappointed with this purchas
It came with a problem on the POWER button
It broke quickly
Don't.  Huge mistake buying this phone.  Less than two months after purchasing it (but, of course, too late to return it), I turned it on one morning to find the message 'Unfortunately the process com.android.phone has stopped.'  When that message is up, there's nothing you can do.  So, I learned about the 'hard reset' process (wiping the phone clean to start over).  After two fruitless phone calls with Samsung ('Oh, you must contact Samsung in the country that the phone was intended for'), and then some exchanges of messages with the seller, I finally accomplished a hard reset, and then after more messages, getting the language back to English (I can't read Russian, which was necessary to know which button to tap). Finally got English back on the phone, only to find that when I tried to input my name for the apps, the keyboard still displays the Russian alphabet.  A seriously inadequate phone...and mediocre support for it if anything goes wrong.
Wasted Money...Very Fragile Equipment.  The worst cell phone I have ever bought. As some customers already posted, I had the same issue with charging the battery, the charging process was intermittent and took so long as well as once charged last a few hours only. I got my phone with a robust case and tempered glass screen protector and after one month with it the first fall happened at around two feet height and over a rug and the screen got simply broken, no cracks but broken, so my cell phone lasts one month :). The screen replacement is around $220 so it doesn't make any sense to do it, better to get another phone but no more Galaxy, at least S6. If helps, my experience for two years with S5 was totally different, great equipment. Think before getting a S6. Regards,
the battery dies to fast that's...
Bad battery.  The battery is bad from day one.
Designed obsolescence anyone?  The fact that you have to disassemble the phone to replace the battery is terrible. Designed obsolescence anyone? I bought this phone new about 2 years ago. It has it good aspects and bad aspects...but the fact that my battery will not hold a charge and it's built into the phone is an epic fail. I'm quite sure it is intentionally designed that way to get people to upgrade sooner than they may have otherwise done. I really want to see some accountability and some sustainability in products. Maybe I'm just alive in the wrong generation for that...so we'll all just keep consuming intentionally flawed products and upgrade to the next while tossing the "outdated" 24 month old model into the landfill. Great. Maybe we should take up this mode of consuming for pets too...I'd always have a cute little kitten! <3
Irresponsible and misleading description  Extremely misleading.  This phone is only compatible with a European SIM card.  The description does mention that it is not originally intended for use in the states, but does not even come close to mentioning that it is completely incompatible.  Do not buy for use in the US.  I read the description thoroughly and repeatedly and was still not prepared for what I received.
Not an unlocked phone  Will not work with Sprint. I was told it is not truly unlocked. Sending back for a refund.
shortly after the software became extremely buggy . I cannot tell time or sign into my iCloud, i cannot use the features i hope to use when i bought the iPhone.
Horrible phone with even worse customer service  Horrible phone with even worse customer service! Within the first two weeks of owning this phone the power button broke. It is not too fun to have a phone that restarts randomly. However it was under warranty so all was not lost. After two weeks a fixed phone was returned, however it was set up to have Sprint as the provider, making the phone unusable for Virgin Mobile. We have been told by customer service that this is as simple to fix as giving us an activation code. However we are now going on a month and half of fighting with customer service and being told " we will have a technician call you in 24 hours". HTC is a horrible company and a little bit of research will show you how many people have similar stories as mine. Please be smart and do not buy a HTC phone especially if you have Virgin Mobile as your provider.
The earphone is NOT original, However, the phone is working fine.  When I bought this item, I thought it was really NEW with Factory sealed tape. Until I found out that the item is already opened. The earphone is NOT original, However, the phone is working fine.
I told that this phone is going to work everywhere. So I ca not use it in Africa. I am not happy with the description.  I am not happy with the description. It should be made clear to the costumer that it is not EVERYWHERE it will work. Also it is not 4G LTE
Fraud!  Do not buy this
Does anyone know the brand?
The phone was defective. not good
RECEIVED ANOTHER ANNOYING PHONE  OTHER PRODUCT RECEIVED, I LIVE IN VENEZUELA WHEN OPEN THE BOX WAS ANOTHER PHONE SAMSUNG S3 MINI, I WANT MY MONEY

Poor shipping  I Love the phone but one star because the mail man left it in front of the house which was poor communication
Phone stops working withing 2 months. Restarted the phone, did hard reset, nothing worked. Unfortunately, I can't return it.
complete rip-off  DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP The cellphone is not new, its modified.. the baterry is chinesse not original and when it discharged the first time the cell didn't turn on again it just reboots and reboots.. i cant return it because i don't live in the US so its an uselles brick now..
don't work. Sent back for full refund.  don't work.  Sent back for full refund.
Amazon sellers falsely sell international models with no warranty coverage in the US  I ordered this product from mercate group, who explicitly claimed I would receive a US market phone with US warranty coverage. I actually received an Australian market device with a warranty that is only valid in Australia. The devices are all visually identical, so unless you explicitly check the small print in the warranty booklet you have no way of knowing you have received the wrong device.  All Nexus 5X series phones are known to suffer from a defect that can render them unable to boot successfully (boot loop). This issue is so widespread that there have been class action lawsuits filed against LG to address it. After many months of normal use, my device began to suffer from this issue as well. Since my device has no warranty in the US, I have no way to receive service for it.
Bad product, stopped to work after almost one year
Disappointed  I have had this phone for a little over a month and I have to admit I'm a bit disappointed and contemplating returning it. I bought it as an ipod replacement because the phone and a 128gb microsd card were cheaper than a new ipod plus I would be able to transfer files more easily. I've used Samsung all my life and have never had a problem until this device. The first phone I had developed a problem with the headphone jack and music would only come out of the right speaker. I tested several headphones and speakers with it. It also had a problem reading the microsd card. Initially it would randomly declare a card error and claim there was no memory card inserted. This is even after formatted the card. Then it started to claim it was inserted but that there were no files on the card when in fact, I knew there were 80+gb of music on it. I got a replacement memory card and it did the same.  I had to open the back cover and remove and then reinsert the memory card and restart the phone to fix this issue.  I then replaced the phone and after one week of use, the new phone also claimed the memory card was empty and seems to have developed headphone jack issues as well. I tend to use this for music in the car with an aux cable and also recently replaced the aux cable. Altogether I cannot figure out the issue. None of my other Samsung devices have ever had issues reading the memory card or developed headphone jack issues. I'll be looking for a new device I think. Disappointing because I wasted money on screen covers and cases.  EDITED TO ADD: I am now on my third version of this phone. Straight out of the box, i put in the microsd card and the phone declared that it was damaged even though i knew it wasn't.  Then a day later it also claimed the memory card was inserted but that it was empty, just as the previous two had done. I'm not sure if Samsung has just gone downhill with their microsd slots or it's this particular model but I have never ever had an issue with memory cards in any of my Samsung devices over the years. I'll be returning this device and moving on to another model that hopefully works well.
not what i expected  The longer that I've had this phone, the more I realize how much I hate it. It randomly deletes my photos. Browsing the web sucks on this phone and I can't open / read a lot of my emails. It takes good photos but the camera takes a very long time to take a photo, and to load between photos. It is absolute crap if you enjoy facebook at all. I'm disappointed with this phone :(
Awful! Phone never worked. The touch screen never dectected touch. I am disappointed that Amazon would partner w a company that sells broken refurbished phones. Totally disappointed. DONT PURCHASE!!
It is not what they announced  The phone I bought is a "Samsung Galaxy S III/S3 GT-I9300 Factory Unlocked Phone - International Version (Pebble Blue)".  The phone I received is a Samsung Galaxy S III / SGH-I747, installed with a GT-I9300 old firmware version.  As a result, the phone had a poor screen resolution and a very poor camera performance and a lot of bugs in applications.  When I tried to update the software to the recent Android 4.1.2 firmware version the phone died and was very hard to discover why.  The phone works fine with its original SGH-I747 firmware and don't understand why they changed to GT-I9300.
DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT AT AMAZON  Don't buy this product ta amazon. My screen is showing a pink line. This is a common problem in S7 edge, however Samsung just provide the replacement in the country that the product was bought. I bought at amazon, but I discovered that the product is from egypt, in that case I will need to travel to egypt to get support !
it was perfectly fine. However  I received a defective product. When I first got the phone, it was perfectly fine. However, about 2 weeks in, the phone randomly dies and won't turn back on unless I put it onto the charger. Another problem arose with my phone. The phone lagged immensely, so I tried restarting the phone. When I restarted the phone, it keeps displaying the initial restart screen that says (samsung), and then it KEEPS repeating that until the phone has no more battery. Even when I place the phone into a charger, the same thing happens.  I tried contacting the seller (Innovations Int.) but they haven't even responded. In order for me to receive help, Samsung needs to know where the seller purchased my phone originally. No luck yet..
Item did not work  Ordered this IPhone 5c as a gift. Out of the box it was locked with a Indiana phone number. I brought it to an Apple Store, where they found the phone defective. Luckily they gave me a brand new phone without a hassle.
DO NOT BUY this phone unlock (Not a good idea to buy from Open Group Wireless)  You won't be able to get this phone repair under warranty by Samsung in the US. Not a good idea to buy from Open Group Wireless)
PIECE OF GARBAGE  I would give this phone less than one star if I knew that was an option.  Honestly, I have wasted so much time on this phone that writing this review seems like even more time wasted, but I feel like I should to protect other people's interests like I wish that mine had been.  It is marketed as being Verizon compatible.  It isn't .  The same goes for T-mobile, Att and Sprint.  Do not waste your time buying this phone.  It doesn't work.
Received the phone and it won't power on. The battery seems like it's bulging out because the screen is slightly popped out. The charging cable also won't completely go in. You're better off buying it from the store. BUY WITH CAUTION!
Not loud
toooooooo old  I bought one it works only one and have month then the mic does not work . I went to apple store they told me it out of guaranty it sold from apple since 2010 so I just loss my money
It came with a charger that's only useful in Great Britain and the adapter for the charger (to use in Venezuela or the US) doesn't fit and I can't charge my phone. Very bad for me.
I have sent it back and wold like one that can be used for Verizon  I was told that is phone was unlocked and could be used as a Verizon phone and it could not, I have sent it back and wold like one that can be used for Verizon...
Phone didn't work with Tmobile  Well, I received the phone in 2 days, however, the trifecta of AMazon, T-Mobile & LG was a problem.  Tmobile couldn't get a signal to the phone, LG G4, for whatever reason. SO i cancelled TMobile and returned the phone to Amazon.  Let someone else figure this crap out.
Totally DISAPPOINTED..  Totally DISAPPOINTED .. !! I'm from Venezuela, and bought a Samsung Galaxy s4 mini phone this seller, which when I get the package was not! since it was a mini Chinese s4! the phone is an expensive paperweight! because of manufacturing problems is not working properly and no one pays Venezuela technical service Chinese phones.
after a wild it just stop connect to the WiFi
Huge Liar this saler!!!!
APPLE IPHONE 3G WITH A DEFECTIVE BATTERY!  I did not like the phone because the battery was very bad..I could not even charge the battery for usage.
there all used don't buy a new  ordered new revieving used
Disappointing!  This is my third Nokia phone, and my second with Microsoft Phone software. The first issue is that the screen is very fragile and breaks easily. I've had my phone for a month and it's broken twice. It should be sold with its own cover for protection. Secondly, the compatibility of Microsoft phone software with other useful softwares, such as Amazon for instance is limited. iPhone and Samsung are much more versatile. BIG disappointment!
Piece of garbage without warranty - Stay away like from the plague!!!!  Don't buy this piece of trash. The phone stopped working after 4 months. It was overheating etc. When you call the Samsung, the people from India say you standard phrases to apply back to Amazon and Amazon says to apply to Samsung. Now, I have a piece of trash that no one can help me to repair. Stay away from Samsung/ Wireless Electronics and all the companies which allow them to sell this garbage!!!
sucks
Not samsung quality  The microphone isn't working well, someone on the other end could barely hear you speak. I have checked all the settings, volume etc.
Locked phone  Bought this phone to work with straight talk. Put straight talk sim but somehow it could not detect the sim. I believe it is a locked phone. Returned it and got full refund.
If only it came with android.  Build quality is great but Windows kills it. This thing crashes me back to the start screen all the damn time. 50/50 chance you can watch more than 3 min of a youtube clip before it freezes and you have to start over and good luck using the reddit app.
regret purchasing this phone  This phone is only freezing up I want my money back, the plastic on the back of the phone chipping off the very first week of purchase
Was so disappointed  Phone has no IMIE number.. Was so disappointed
Loved the phone  Loved the phone. Looks and feels great but it came with a defective camera so I'm just completely turned off. Don't love it anymore.
Screen shattered very easy and you can not see the screen horizontally when you wear sunglasses "you can see only black"  I bought nexus 5, about 50 days ago from google play store online. Three days later, I accidentally dropped the phone from only two feet high on flat plastic tile (it fell off fron my y-sherts poket when I pick up somting) but the screen glass shattered. I called google to explain them, the google representative transfer phone to LG company. They charged $170 to replace the screen which is half of new phone price.  I received the phone two weeks later. The phone is not receiving signal from T-mobile sometimes received one or two bar of low signal but that was E or H signal which is very slow, not even 3G, 4G nor LTE. I did not get any signals indoor at all. I called LG service again to explain, they told me to return the phone again to their service center with provided return label which was not overnight service it was Fedex ground service. I have to wait another two weeks to received my cellphone back.  Two weeks later I received phone back from LG but it was same condition. I seems they did not even looked at it. it did not received any strong or fast signal from t-mobile. I called LG again, they told me same thing like two weeks ago. "Send it back to LG".  I bought nexus5 I used it for three days, I could not used my phone for more than a month now. LG seems not care, they will send me another ground shipping label to send it back, I have to wait another two weeks. I will never buy LG product again. it broke very easily and their service is very bad.  One more, even if evrythig fine, you can not see the screen horizentally while you are wearing sunglases. You can see only black screen untill you turn it to vertical position!!!
The touch id didn't work...
I have had this phone for 3 months and it has stopped recharging.
Already repaired - sold as new  Not original glass, not new, not original display, sold as new and it is not.  Completely dissapointed!
Nothing but LAG.  Software has severe flaws!  . I have owned the S3, Note 3, and now this crappy Note 4  First off here is a list of PROs and CONs  PRO (unique PROS) -S-Pen, I can use it to sign and fill documents. -Fingerprint Unlock- the reason I upgraded to the Note4 from the Note3 -Removeable battery...If you do any kind of travelling (air) it is very handy to swap batteries instead of looking for an outlet or being tethered to a battery brick -Nice specs, like the camera (but I can promise you, you will miss the money shot)  CONs (Just one BIG one) -LAG--Lollipop 5.0.1 Lags.  Many times it takes so long for the phone to unlock it locks back up!!  WTH samsung.  It takes about 10 seconds for the phone to actually connect and dial.  When you answer an incoming call, the phone takes so long the caller goes to voicemail.  Then AGAIN, you have to wait through the lag to dial.  Oddly, my LG watch shows the caller calling WAY before it actually comes up on the phone.  I live in New York so i took it to the Samsung Store.  They made sure everything was up to date and sent me on my way.  I need to go back, but since then I have read up on this issue and it seems it is inherent in this device.  The PRO are VERY appealing, I agree, but the phone just does not work.  I have read that many people have downgraded back to KitKat version 4.4.4.  I have not got around to messing with it, since something that cost this much, probably should work out of the box, Samsung!  There are those people that say you have too much running in the background.  I have about the same as I did on the Note 3 so that cant be it.  Even the S3 was better.  Also, this is a Flagship phone, are you not supposed to be able to use your phone that way?  I almost bought the LG G3 or G4.  I am definitely not buying anymore Samsung junk (mainly due to the awful decision to make the  battery non-removable and remove the SD slot)
I bought this phone from just about a month ago. and the screen messed up. I started seeing multiple colours and now i can't see a thing. the phone didn't fall or anything of that sort. ineed a refund and or a new phone... please be warned..i have not heard back from seller!!! i feel cheated!!
Do not buy this product from this listing on Amazon. The software has been tampered with and is not the original software from HTC. This is not HTC that are selling this. I've been in contact with HTC directly as i have been having problems. After telling me to boot into recovery mode and such, they tell me the software has been tampered with.  My headphones do not work, my bluetooth connectivity is iffy at times, and it says under "usage" in the settings that "This is a test device...".
this smartphone battery did not last even a year
Worst phone I've ever had  I got this phone mostly because some of the apps that allow you to use it as a guitar amp (also i needed a new phone). After 3 days of use I realized that even though apple apps store is great is not worth it. The battery is a joke I had to get my charger wherever I was; the interface is very simple to use but it does not allow to personalize themes at all; and the IOS is kinda nice but it crashes continuously and does not offer lag free performance. I had an ipod 4 that my sister gave me for free because she got an iphone. Even though the ipod had some faults I loved it, that's why I chose an iphone, but I learned apple product are great only if you get them for free.
Four Stars  poor
Cellphone will not charge
Ok Purchase.  This is really not an unlocked phone. It looks like the AT&T locked phone is unlocked by the code and delivered. It still has AT&T default apps which you see in the locked phones. I contacted Ross Cellular on this, they replied that this model is AT&T branded, so you will have all those apps.  Even though it worked with different carrier (tried T-Mobile), but if you are really looking for an unlocked phone don't get this model. And more over, the bundle did not have headphone, the charger and the user manual looked cheap, i guess they are not the real Nokia ones.
The screen turn black periodically and I can do nothing about it.
the screen got black out after 4 months, and i do not know how to contact for warranty!
Water damage  There is water damage to the phone and I need a new one
Phone had significant water damage  The phone has had intermittent problems ever since we got it. We finally took it in to have the battery replaced and the technician found significant water damage that had not been repaired by the seller. Because we are more than 30 days past the purchase date they are unwilling to work with us on resolving the issue.
The phone seemed to ma as counterfeit  The phone  seemed to ma as counterfeit
False advertisment  The phone was suppose to be "new" but when the box arrived it came in a refurbished box. Refurbish is not new. That was false advertisement. The blue back case doesn't look blue at all. It looks like an all black phone instead. The phone seems to be functioning properly but I'd much rather not have this phone right now. Unfortunately I cant return it, but I will be selling it.
Didnt work well at all
Was unlocked
The phone does not work, shuts down every moment. Do not buy
Battery issues  Phone battery is horrible. Have to constantly charge the phone. I spoke to Apple support and did everything possible within the settings to minimize battery use and nothing worked. Dont waste your money.
Badly refurbished phone  This phone is badly refurbished. It looked fine. But it started lagging and restartin itself randomly. I wrote to the company but I was outside the window to return the phone. They told me that I could exchange it, but that phone is worse than the first one! I cannot use it at all anymore. It freezes as soon as I turn it on and then restarts over and over. I tried trouble shooting. I factory reset the phone but nothing helped. I wrote to the company again but they said there was nothing they could do. They said this wasn't happening to anyone else, but I can see for other comments that that isn't true. Now I'm out $200 and have no phone.  Save yourself the money and frustration
item not decoded  I bought the nokia lumia under the impression it was unlocked just to get out of town and present it to the reciept to realise it was not unlocked. i spent an extra 100 dollars to unlock it. I would advise you stay away from these people. They don't seem to be doing genuine business. Nokia lumia is a great phone but this company is not.
Phone is crap.  Do not buy. Phone is crap.
DON'T BUY IT, DONT BUY IT!  I bought directly from the Apple store, then my concern is about the quality of the product and not regard Amazon. I gave one to my wife and during one year she faced several problems with the operational system. Exactly after one year of acquisition, the phone turn off and does not resuscitate anymore. In the Apple store they told me that was a problem of manufacturer and offer me a brand new one for USD 280,00. It is not serious offer!! They produce trash and I should pay twice. My conclusion about this phone is: The Iphone 5c  is a piece of s. Sorry if I disappoint you.

Not even a month an the home key isn't working
Beware of power button issues.  Phone worked well for about 7 months and then started turning off on its own.  Sometimes turned off in the middle of a call or while booting on.  Investigated potential software issues (viruses) and found nothing.  Discovered that this phone has issues with the power button.  Tried all of the solutions to fixing the power button issue with no luck.  Can't give a good review of a phone that doesn't work in a reliable manner.  Need to replace this phone but very leary of buying a Nexus or an LG phone.
The cell have a white line in the screen
Chipped screen on arrival spread to FULL crack. Huawei refuses to replace.  Only two months after purchase from Amazon a tiny microscopic screen chip defect (barely noticeable originally) on the very right edge of the screen has now spread entirely across the screen as very visible hairline crack. It has never once been dropped and has worn it's protective case I bought simultaneously since the moment it came out of the box. Huawei claims their warranty will not cover the $180 screen repair on this brand new $650 phone. Awful customer service agent also hung up on me. Do NOT waste your money on this!
sellar cheat with me.. on this phone
Does this phone have front and back camera? Thanks
It's a scam!  Scam! When I was buying it, it was a sim card, not iPhone! It costed 1 cent and didn't worked.  They did it to get reviewes and now are changing description. What a shame!
Horrible quality. Do not buy!  Horrible item! Do not buy phones from anywhere on Amazon. This phone is a European phone and does not work well with the 4G LTE here in the States. I bought this phone for my girlfriend and it has given her problems ever since she first got it. I decided to give it a try before trying to return it and now 5 months in is absolutely trash and there's no warranty!!!! The phone turns itself off at random times and the speaker quit working.
won't connect to any network  I had a bad experience: While the device (the international model, D821) worked great in an area with wifi, it could never connect to any telecom network!! I tried SIM cards of TMobile and AT&T. Folks at TMobile worked hard to understand the nature of the problem. Sucks! Going to return it and get a US/Canada (D820) version.
there is a pink line on the screee when i  ussed.
fate
Product says UNLOCKED phone, but it is LOCKED
I came conproblemas signal!
can't send or receive picture mesaages  I would have given this phone a much higher rating if not for this function. I got my phone two days ago and have been trying to send picture messages since yesterday but kept on getting an error message saying "Can't send. Try again". I went to my local T-Mobile store to get this problem check out but it seems that the problem lies in the hardware of the phone, not the network. I'm going to contact another mobile tech and a third party phone store to get this check out. If I still can't find a solution to this problem, I'll have to return the phone then.
Don't buy and waste your money... Only with this seller iNSYNC - US
You should do a google search on "nexus 6p bootloop" to see for yourself what happens to this phone after 12-14 months of use. It starts to have infinite aborted bootups and you cannot fix this. Even the resetting to factory settings does not work anymore. My phone was hit by the same problem, and Google acknowledges that this is a terminal problem, but it won't provide a replacement because the phone just passed the warranty period. Google used to be the "do no evil" company, but it is not anymore. You've been warned: stay away from this phone.
Can't print out the form  Can't print out the return form and I'm having issues to access it. The phone isn't working and wanted to return it.
Terrible product speakers and vibration mode hs right after the warranty !  So dissapointed the phone became useless no ringtone no silent mode , no video or call without headphones ! I feel they stole my money .
Ordered 2 and one stopped working a week after. Couldnt return because i was on vacation....
DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!  It will work for couple of months and stop working like mine did, I tried to get them to take it back and fix it but they wouldnt.... here is the conversation:  Hello, I purchased a Samsung Galaxy S4 from you (with another account). I  have never dropped the phone, it was always in the case. It was fine until  two 1 week ago. When I turn it on I get a black and white Samsung Galaxy  Gt-i9505 Logo and then I just hear the music. The phone works but the screen  does not, the buttons beside home button do light up. I tried calling US  Samsung they told me to try PH Samsung, but they told me to contact you...  Can I send it back? I also changed my address recently. Here is the order  number and stuff when I got an email conformation. Responce from  FGS Trading next day Hello  I am sorry to hear this. Please try a hard reset, this may remove any glitches the phone has. Unfortunately we can no longer take it back since it is past our 30 days return policy.  Emma I responded immediately: Tried that. Yeah but every Samsung phone has 1 year warranty so because the hardware stopped working properly 1 and a half week before 1 year warranty expires since I bought it. You must take care of this. Response from FGS Trading Hello  I am sorry to hear this. Please contact Samsung. Unfortunately we can no longer take it back since it is past our 30 days return policy.  Emma Really bad costumer service... If you want a guarantee/warranty that It will get fixed if ever breaks, don't buy this phone!
wrong  wrong color
Really a nightmare from elm street kinda phone  This phone really has been a nightmare. From the beginning the other person was not being able to hear me. I always sounded far away and I resorted to using a pair of earphones with mic. Then the phone started to automatically restart and freeze. Next came auto sending of txts after typing one character. Also takes horrible pictures. The only thing good about this phone is the screen size for the price at $50 and the battery life. I would stay away from this phone ever at $20.
Save your money for something better.  I bought this item for my mom back in India. This phone was totally a disaster it proved out to be :(
Does not come with phones and is not an Android Cellphone  Don't be foolished by this ad, the device is not Android based. It works with windows 7.5. I'm trying to charge it for the first time, but I'm not sure it is working. And all of my friends that bought a similar model told me that it came with earphones, and this one didn't. I'm very disappointed, if I could I would return it. Also, the box does not look like the one in the picture and the phone is from AT&T. I hope it is really unlocked, I'll try it today.
I received the cell without battery.
Phone is a fake  What ppl need to realize that this is a fake phone the realize version  SIM card n memory slot is on opposite side of each other, a lot of features don't work please know what u is buying before u purchase this item
Its blacklisted  DONT BUY
Phone is not unlocked and im so worried because i order another one  The phone is not unlocked
The phone simply doesn't power on.. Do nothing if I connect it to the charger. Waited "charging" the phone for 4 hours.. Tried again but nothing.. It is dead..
I am disappointed. Within 1 week the device went into black screen mode and has not come on since. I am very hurt.
Buyer Beware  Phone calls are muffled and not working 3 months in. Hardware issue that the company knows about and doesn't seem interested in fixing. Very disappointed.
I asqued for  a pink phone and I received a Blue one.
Horrible Pls don't buy from this seller  After one month, my phone keep on restarting for every 5 mins. i took it to repair shop they told motherboard needs to be replaced. which costs almost half of the phone cost.. I just took a chance even by looking the reviews.. i am screwed
This phone is not supported by Samsung  Purchase this phone because of the size,  now the touch screen is not responding properly,  I hit the a key and may get "ap" or "al" or a whole string of characters, it backspaces or dbl spaces at random. Contacted Samsung and was informed that this is a Korean phone by its identification numbers and that they do not support it. The tech also informed me that Samsung doesn't make this phone even tho their name is all over it. We are in the process of contact with the seller to resolve this now. will update as I receive more information.
Bot combatable with t mobile
No, I received the phone and instead of white is was black. I didn't returned the phone because it was for someone else out of the U.S.
Missing are not
Fake information on my purchase - I need a solution  I want to complain about fake information on my recent purchase. In the description of this iphone, it said unlocked international. When I turned on the phone, I had the unpleasant surprise that it had an AT&T chip and it wasn't unlocked. I searched the IMEI number in the AT&T website and it said that the phone couldn't  be unlocked because the previous owner had unpaid bills. I'm totally upset about this purchase and I demand a solution. I attaching a screenshot of what I found in the AT&T website. I need an answer and a solution as soon as posible. Nilo Velarde Ch
Serious Phone problems in the 3rd month  The phone looks re-furbished; I was ok with that but two weeks ago the screen started flickering and it went off and even on plugging in did not come on for 3 days. I tried it again it came on but has gone off again.  Certainly not worth the purchase
No 4G connection  phone did not connect to AT&T 4G network. Provides basic internet access only. Cannot use.
I hate it!  A friend purchased this as a gift for me a year ago and after having it for a few months, I started to notice problems.  I wish I could of returned it at the time.  Currently I'm only using it until I can upgrade.  I admit that it is nice to have a phone already unlocked, but that is the only plus.  However, it does have a decent storage size but I did add an SD card for additional space.  First off, you will need to replace the battery.  The factory battery only lasted four hours in my pocket (with everything turned down low, data apps shut off, ect), this was not good for me since I worked 16 hour shifts.  I had to purchase a larger battery and a case to fit it.  The end result was the phone looking  like a boat.  The camera quality is awful! There is no zooming in, if you do you end up with nothing but a blurred picture.  Even standing at a short distance ends up with your pictures having a zoomed out effect.  If you want to take something of a decent quality, you have to stand on top of your subject.  This disappoints me because I did a lot of research before choosing a phone and wanted the phone based off the camera reviews.  I'm starting to think that I have a defective phone.  A month after having it I realized I couldn't take a screen shot, the button jams inside the phone and causes the phone to restart constantly!  I had to partially pry the power button out with my fingernail to get the phone to stop.  Every morning between 3 AM and 5 AM, my phone will do a random restart.  I'm unsure of what causes this but there are times when I'm woken up during the night by the start up screen chiming.  Overall, I am unhappy with this phone.  I appreciate that my friend bought it for me but I am going to upgrade soon.  I have friends that have Galaxys and have never had problems with them.  Apparently the mini phones are just awful.
Terrible  Horrible
This phone was great..  This phone was great... For about 11 months. Then it died completely. Luckily it was still in warranty period, so I sent it back. They fixed it, but now I have the battery issue that is all over the internet. My battery will shut off at 65%. Neither Google nor Huawei will do anything about it. Total garbage. That's what I get for trying a piece of crap Chinese phone. Back to Samsung/HTC for me. I took a chance since Google put their name on it, never again.
Great Phone when new  I bought mine a couple of months ago (used), and it came with a defective charging port, don't get me wrong the 1 star rating is because of the cost-benefit ratio on this transaction, it was cheap $ 130 i think, but i have to invest another 100 bucks to make it work (charge). Otherwise the phone its a great product, it performs very well i installed ICS and it makes the phone better.  The only advice, don't buy it used.
Beware you might get shipped an AT&T phone  Beware, it's not a stock phone. It's an AT&T phone with a locked boot loader. You will be able to put it on another GSM network but you will not get the AT&T OTA update. You will have to update your phone manually using the RUU download from AT&T. Being that I desperately needed a new phone I decided to keep it despite it was not what exactly what I thought I was getting. I've wasted several hours getting the phone updated, rooting and installing a custom ROM to get all the AT&T cruft off the device.
Misleading offer  Bad bad !!!!! No buy !!! Misleading offer
TELCEL 4g LTE don't work!!  This phone don't work in Telcel 4g LTE :/  Only H+ or 3G works i put my sim card 4g LTE from telcel and don't see LTE network why?
disappointed in Florida  Because it came with no manual it said new and I can't find a case or anything for that matter to go with it unless I order it!!!!!
I tried changing SIM but didn't work in India
It's not what I was expectant at all. They don't answer my emails.
Don't buy Google/Huawei phone they throwing blame at each other  Brick after 1 year,the phone just suddenly died and stuck on Google logo. Do yourself a favor check online about this problem you will find a lot of people have the same problem
Not compatible with T-Mobile Network  The phone is an AT&T phone, with proprietary software on it. So even though it is unlocked, it comes with ATT software that you cannot remove. And it comes with ALL of the ATT software , from what I can tell. I use T-Mobile.  At first I thought it came with a bad battery, so I bought another.  The phone kept restarting at about 1/3 battery and would continuously reboot unless I plugged in a charger. It would drain the battery within a few hours.  Then I bought another battery, and then another. For a grand total of 3 extra batteries. All of the batteries were losing charge very very fast (within a few hours) and all of them were over heating and bulging after several hours of this.  Combine this with the vanity camera taking pictures that looked like they were taken in a steamy shower, ATT software taking over the phone when I did not want it too, I grew frustrated and bought a new phone.  The moment I disconnected this phone from my service, it stopped having a battery problem. It went 4 days of sitting there before it needed a recharge. From what I can tell, the ATT software was clashing at a major level with T-Mobiles network.  Summary?  Not compatible with T-Mobile at a significant level. I regret not making this discovery before I ran out of my return time limit.
Wasted my money on this  Wasted my money on this.  Very disappointed.  Battery is bad.  I only used the phone couple of days before the battery started swelling up and started getting hot every time I used the phone.  Really disappointed.
Do not recommend to get Iphones unless directly to Apple stores  Had to many problems with this phone. Do not recommend to get Iphones unless directly to Apple stores.
The phone does not work, the location of the sim card is defective, it can not read the sim card
Never again...  I will never order any phone from this company again. I had loved it, at first. Replaced the charger within a week. After a month, had problems with the phone itself. It refuses to charge, period.
Disappointed!  It had more scratches on the back then what I expected!
I just got this phone and I wanted to switch my number I have through verizon but The sim card is to small for the slot could I use it with Verizon network
some features not working properly
It's Apple what do you expect
Pos phone from India. Couldnt turn it in for anything. J O K E
Phone NOT DUAL SIM  When i recieved the phone, IT WAS NOT DUAL SIM as the description said.
This whole purchase has sucked.  No you sold a phone that is locked and can not be unlocked at all. You should really let people know that y'all don't know if the phone is good to use or not. Especially for the amount I paid.
not recommended  The phone belongs to the phone company at & t is true is unlocked, but it comes from the factory as stated in the publication, I want to note that in the last comment I forgot to post that the phone did not bring the handsfree, so it seems to me very the publication distasteful that place. for this reason I do not recommend the store.
Defective Product Sold  Defective refurbished phone. Proper testing must not have been done. Phone showed signs of defective speaker system almost immediately.
Screen stopped working
Customer Services is Terrible.  I had the Samsung S4 less than a month and the digitizer went out.  I took it to the Samsung representative at Best Buy and they said the digitizer was out.  The phone worked internally, but would not work to the touch.  It was like it froze up.  Not happy with paying $200 now having to pay additional $80 to get it fixed.  No response from company when I email to find out what type of warranty I could claim.  Don't know how to get in touch with them any other way.  NOT HAPPY!
nexus 5 cell phone has garbled noise on video playback, bad  You guys need to fix the nexus 5 phone cells.  The first time I used it when I tried to playback my grandkids video performance with music in the background, there was a horrible garbled noise or underwater sound. Every video that I recorded that had extra sounds in the background, the playback was bad.  It also makes a clicking noise when I push the buttons. I think the phone would be good if not for these issues.  I have already contacted amazon and breed where I bought it from and just want to get my money back, I have had it less than 30days.
Make sure it works on whatever network you are thinking of ahead of time.  The Nexus 5 is a beautiful phone. The issue is that "unlocked" doesn't exactly mean unlocked. This phone does not work on the Sprint Network, and I'm not entirely sure what networks it will work on the the US. Amazon has a "no return" policy on this phone, but their customer service folks were helpful and understanding and they are taking it back.
Wrong photo  This photo is wrong,this is not what I received.
faulse advertisement  The phone is great,I just can't understand why some sellers such that one post a faulse description,it's not unlocked,shame on you,that's cheating...
Chinese imitation. Died after 10 days  Obviously a Cheap chinese imitation. It had a couple of scratch on the imitation of a imitation leather. No 3000mh battery. Worked for 10 days then died eternally. I had to return it. Nothing like the original G4 which I already had for a year, purchased from a different seller. This is not the one.
Usado  Estaba Usado
Completely a pos as soon as i got it the common lg flicker started within seconds
I bought the phone in January. Now it will not charge. I replaced the battery and still won't charge. I replaced with a fully charged battery. The phone works but the battery is discharging and I still can't charge.
Received a used phone  I bought an lg g2 from Amazon earlier this year. It was brand new. I peeled the protective plastic off the lens, camera, power button and around the edges of the phone. So my expectancy is the same buying the lg g3. This phone has scuffs on the camera lens, battery, and face of the phone. No plastic to peel off, no new phone scent.  Im very disappointed, this was to be a gift for my daughter's birthday so only opened the phone today and now the surprise is on me. Dont think i will buy from Amazon again.  NEW*** The box of the phone states it is a GSM 900/1800 Dual band... So the description of the phone on Amazon is misleading
Center button broken  The center button of the cellphone was broken, I had to return the device and ask for a refund.
Bad Phone  This was a defected item and was returned. Battery was bad, took about an hour to charge in full then drained quickly (lasted 3-5 hours). 30% of the screen was no effect when touching on it.
This phone didn't even last for 6 months, went black never works after that. very disappointed
Never again.  Phone only lasted 2 weeks.
save yourself and money do not buy  My first nexus was awesome, so when drowned in the toilet without second thought, I bought the next available Nexus and it was happened to be 6P.  A year and a half, battery drain faster than faster then suddenly shutdown without warning at 30%, then 40%, 50%, 60%, 80% now I have to constantly plugin.  I called Google, I called Huawei, they were the call center in Mexico without any authority to do anything to help you except repeatedly saying "we follow the procedure" the procedure written to served Huawei interest, nothing for consumer.  Don't believe me then Google "Nexus 6P battery drain and shutdown" or "class action lawsuit" you get +++hits.  They don't take responsible for their so obvious manufacturing defect.  I paid $$$$ for a defect phone.
The phone is all in Russian and appears refurbished and not factory new. I managed to change the language but it had a number saved in its contacts which says a lot. Besides that, a big problem is that the phone will only charge if plugged to the european charger with european prongs it came with or if plugged directly to the computer. This is NOT OK!
The telephone died after six months!!!  I bought the telephone in january and suddenly it doesn't work anymore. I live in Brazil and the warranty cant't be used here at the Samsung Assistance. What should I do?
battery won't hold, need charge everyday, don't buy.
Review  This company is formely bluetek usa...they sold me a phone that was advertised unlocked....but it was LOCKED!!!...please becarefulof them!!...after ship;ping they only realised it was locked till they sold it and i reported it to them!...pooooorrrr  services
This iphone is not right! the IMEI does not match the box!
BAD CELL.... (celular daado)  EL CELULAR NO SIRVE, NO TIENE PARA EXPANSION DE MEMORIA CUANDO EN LA DESCRIPCION DECIA QUE SI, SOLO FUNCIONA CONECTADO A WIFI, NO LEVANTA 3G, SOLO EDGE O GPRS, ME ROBARON, YO PAGUE 290 DOLARES POR ESTO, AHORA QUIEN ME RESPONDE POR ESTO... HAGANSE RESPONSABLES...  The damaged cell came calling does not have expandable memory, it only works connected to Wifii, who now answer me for this, pay 290 dollars.
Phone didn't work.
Worst experience with the phone
i bought this phone and after a few days of using it, it gets really hot while charging and shut down while i am using it
The phone is horrible, I took phone to have screen repaired for $60 and got a glass screen protector for $25 and the phone locks on certains pages and when you turn off and reset the power button doesn't work sometimes, the tech also said there were 2 screws missing inside phone!
fraudulent seller  I bought a Samsung Galaxy III off amazon. 369$ in December 2013. The phone arrived looking brand new with case and charger. When I took it to get activated, it did not have a SIMs card. upon further inspection, it did not have a serial number or the inside sticker and I was told it was probably stolen. Attempted to contact the seller, No response. I thought I was out the money, but luckily Amazon backed me and refunded the money. Be careful who you buy from..........FYI  the phone was available elsewhere for cheaper had I done a little shopping around....lesson learned.
NOT new a ripoff  this phone was "NEW". NOT TRUE!  worked ok for 2 months. The touch screen became too sensitive after an upgrade apple forced. found this phone was reg. to someone else awhile back prior to me buying it. You got " We cant warranty used phones." This order was filled by your warehouse. I wonder how many other fraudulent sales you make. I think a letter to the states Attorney General and BBS might be in order.
Nice phone, bad speakers  I had hoped that the rattling speaker issue wasn't as bad as some said... but it was. My bottom speaker was blown, so I sent it back. Too bad, because it was a nice phone, otherwise.
BUYER BEWARE: LG does not honor 1-year manufacturer's warranty for unlocked GSM phones  *BUYER BEWARE* An unlocked phone makes a great purchase, just plug in a SIM card and go, except a major problem and issue with LG is that the company DOES NOT honor their 1-year manufacturer's warranty for unlocked phones. So if you purchase this phone and have any issues, LG will repair for a fee. Note that LG does not have ANY written policy or mention (in the warranty documentation that comes with the phone, company website or repair webpages) about unlocked phones being out of warranty. This is solely reported AFTER the phones are sent to be repaired. Bottom line: If you want to pay for an LG phone and are willing to buy a new one if any issues come up after a year, then go for it. Otherwise, if you want a company that will stand by their products for at least a year after purchase, then you may want to skip LG.
Buyer Beware  Everyone should be aware that the advertised Uh Oh Protection for carrier switches requires you to send in your old phone in order to get a new one, meaning that if you do not have a backup laying around, they expect you to go without your phone for a week. In my specific case, they were nice enough to send me the wrong phone, which I had to then pay for shipping materials to send back to them before they told me they were unable to send me the correct phone, even though one of the speakers has stopped working. While they're decent phones (except for the speaker that will not work now), if you're getting it for the Uh Oh Protection, caveat emptor.
Defective phone or sim  I thought I was in love with this phone but after having the phone for only 5 days and having it active (I had to order a sim) for 2 it's now saying that there's no sim when there clearly is. I'm so upset behind this bc I'm not sure if it is in fact a defective phone or sim! However I will say before this it was a great phone
Disabled SD card: "Format as Internal"  When you buy a Samsung phone with Marshmallow, Samsung has intentionally disabled "Format SD card as Internal". This is disabling the best feature of Android Marshmallow, so greedy Samsung can make more money out of you.. You are better off buying an ASUS Zenfone 3.  Half the price, better specs, and they don't do stupid things like Samsung.
from day one its been giving me problems the charger they sent with it doesnt pertain to it , plus on screen its written that you cant distribute this item without permission & now it doesnt hold charge at all returning it,,
Worst buy of my life  Worst buy of my life. Microphone does not work. Can't make outgoing calls every other time. And as of today, it will go on and off, the screen display has problems. Used to be an android fan. Not going to last. Go for another phone
screen was cracked
Phone was in worse shape then stated  Should have read more reviews.  Phone was in worse shape then stated.  Would not buy from buyer again.
Not unlocked  Although it says unlocked, it is linked to AT&T. I called apple, that said I should call AT&T, that said I should call Amazon, that said I should call the provider, that said the phone WAS unlocked. They had me do many tests, still insisted the phone was unlocked, even though I had Apple's and AT&T statements that it was not. Finally I was connected to the manager, who asked me to turn the phone back on 24 hours later - he would try to unlock it through AT&T. Bingo!
Not a Verizon Phone  Buyer beware.  Despite being advertised as a unlocked phone for Verizon I was unable to have the phone activated by any Verizon retailer.  The phone is for a GSM network.  Verizon uses CDMA.
It worked for one month only. Horrible customer service!  I purchased this on 10/10, it was working fine until a few days ago. All of a sudden, when i made a call and it got connected, but i couldn't hear anything unless i put on speaker. i tried a few methods including resetting the phone to the factory setting (per their tech support suggested), but nothing worked. the manufacturer customer services was impatient and rude! they told me to send the phone back for repair or replacement, but refused to provide a curtesy phone until this phone is fixed, which means i would be without a cell phone for 14 days (the process time)! This is rediculous. I was very upset and disappointed by their horrible services. Luckily i checked with Amazon to find out i have till 11/12 to return this. so i quickly did and thought to share my unpleasent experience as a warning for those who are interested in buying this phone.
What happened whit the money? I don't have in my gift card or my account
good phone until you get a boot loop issue  good phone until you get a boot loop issue.  now a brick.  No warranty.  Stay away because it will happen to your phone.  I will stay away from LG for the rest of my life.
Phone does not work.  Other person does not hear you. Phone gets extremely hot and battery takes along time to charge.
I feel very disappointed by the team  the product is very used, and has many visible blows, which classifies it as class C. I feel very disappointed by the team, now I will have to spend a lot of money to place a case
I looked inside the charger port and it looks like there are pieces of metal shards inside  This phone, will not turn on, it says it's charging but it has been charging all day and still says low battery and won't turn on. I looked inside the charger port and it looks like there are pieces of metal shards inside. So disapointed in the product.
This phone is great but it is plagued by a boot looping error  This phone is great but it is plagued by a boot looping error. Haven't been able to fix the phone or get it replaced. Would not recommend buying ever
Never Ending Bootloop!  I bought my phone 18 months ago through Google's Project Fi plan. As of yesterday, it is stuck in an endless startup loop. It is a known problem on Google and LG's end. My phone is out of warranty. So will have to pay more money for a replacement or pay $150 to fix plus shipping to LG's repair shop. Both companies have been useless.
I Have No Idea How This Phone Has 200+ Positive Reviews  This phone is a piece of garbage!  Without a doubt, the very worst tech purchase I have made.  We bought this phone because the phone we wanted (Motorola) was unavailable in South East Asia.  This phone freezes all the time. It can barely handle one open app.  It is impossible to use for web browsing as it can barely handle one open window.  This phone is not capable of running Android in any usable fashion.  The Samsung launcher is absolute garbage.  Since purchasing this phone we have made a decision not to purchase any Samsung products ever.
This is unfortunately a pretty bad phone  This is unfortunately a pretty bad phone.  I got it two months ago to replace a nexus 5, and i've been very underwhelmed.  It's loaded with samsung bloatware, and the general performance is terrible.  There's very noticeable lag when doing anything, and event typing is slow.  I've had some strange issues where the back button in all of my apps stops working until I restart the phone.  Lastly, battery life is terrible, it is sometimes fully drained in less than 6 hours.  The phone will heat up so much in my pocket I need to remove it to cool it down.  It looks nice, but don't be fooled, there are much better android phones out there!!
Not UNlocked  I got the ohone. It had more damage that was not specified like the sim card door was broken and difficult to get open. I spent over two hours on the phone with my cell service provider trying to figure out why the phone would not work only to find out that it was not an unlocked phone and therefore could not be used with my company. Hence why it was sent back and a refund requested. Not Happy to be lied to.
I give it 2 stars because it did not come with the original box. and did not come with instructions which makes me think it is repaired previously ordered the same phone and if it was new but I repeat this makes me think that it is not.
The phone heats up quickly for some reason.  The phone heats up quickly for some reason. plus you need to select the settings every time you clear the RAM
Unreliable  My phone break badly after falling from just 1 1/2 feet height. Its screen is totally breakable with a small shock. Gorilla glass won't protect. Gorilla Glass 2 is just a marketing gimmick, it is just as regular glass. I used a slim case with Samsung that didn't protect at all.  All features are good. FAST and EXCELLENT.  No Protection available from Samsung like apple care. Now I am worried to have this phone.  Those who already have this phone please buy insurance or add a bulky beauty killing cases. No I have to find another phone..
today i got delivery of phone. But here shows it is unlocked and when i checked the phone it shows it is a T mobile phone!!! I am so pissed off. What if i go to another country???? Will another sim card than t mobile work?
This is not a good Idea because 8 GB is not enough  This is not a good Idea because 8 GB is not enough. I have had this phone for less than a year and sometimes it doesn't work because of the storage when I went to the apple store they told me that I had to deal with it. I wouldn't not recommend this product plus IOS takes up 3 GB so you are practically left with 5.
Not recommend.  Device is wonderful, battery is terrible, after 1yr I had the battery replaced at my cost, after a couple months battery is back to giving me problems, phone shuts down randomly. I can NOT recommend this device. just google Nexus 6p battery issues, there's more information available. Since I expirenced 1yr of bliss, I'll give the phone 2 stars.
Trash buyer beware  Charged and worked once. Total trash
the phone was defective and had several hardware problems and the company would not repair the problems
Battery swelling  The battery started swelling after few months of usage and the display came out due to swollen battery.
PHONE DOES NOT WORK  AFTER A FEW DAYS TO USE THE PHONE DOES NOT WORK restarts CONSTANTLY AND NEVER INSIDE THE OPERATING SYSTEM
was not compatible with our plan  We were searching for Verizon phones....we ordered it and it is not a Verizon compatible phone....so be careful the phone you order will work with your plan
not recommended  item never worked
Beware the dreaded bootloop - stay away from all LG phones!  First the good: For 10 months, my 2 G4 phones were fine. Nice screen, pretty responsive, good camera, no issues at all. Battery life was OK, but not great. The curve of the phone made it nice to hold in the hand, but was a bit negative placing the phone on a flat surface as it was wiggly.  But after 10 months, both died with the infamous "boot loop" problem that is common across all LG mobile phones (google "LG bootloop" before you buy any LG phone!!) One phone that was in almost mint condition got replaced by TMobile. The other phone, my son's, had a tiny almost invisible crack at the top around the bezel, not impacting use of the phone at all. LG told me this voids the factory warranty and that they only do partial repairs and this would cost $150. Others who had repairs done say this problem reappears, so I can't justify paying this much to fix a faulty phone.  Bottom line: stay away from this phone (G5, V10, V20 also have similar problems)
I bought this phone around a year ago. The phone would frequently restart whenever I open google maps or google chrome. I lived with it for a while but from the past two weeks the phone died down completely and the battery would last only for 10 minutes or so. I called LG customer care but they said they will not repair this phone as this is out of warranty. I will definitely avoid buying a LG phone in future as I do not think they would last more than a year.
The Samsung seal on the box was damaged. I returned it for full refund.
BATTERIES ON THESE ARE  REAL BAD!!!!  I OWNED THIS FOR 4 YEARS.  IT WILL LAST YOU BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO KEEP CHARGING THE BATTERY ( EVEN UNDER NORMAL USAGE)  HAD TO CHARGE MINE TWICE A DAY AND I DONT USE IT THAT MUCH.  SECOND.. THE SCREEN IS TOO SMALL COMPARED TO THE NEW ONES TODAY  AND THIRD PICTURES ON THESE ARE NOT THAT GOOD.
Wasn't incompatible with T-MOBILE
Worst money I have spent in a long time!  I've had the phone less than 24 hours & pretty sure I hate it. The keyboard glitches when trying to sign in to a website or app like Amazon. After typing user name when trying to type the password the characters won't show because it isn't accepting the keystrokes. The first 3 or 4 times this happened I was hoping was a fluke kind of thing. Nope, the phone is junk & a waste of $140. Now the language in my Facebook app has started glitching. There are no words in my news feed only square blocks for words. The screen display is big & beautiful, but not much good if it doesn't work.
Reportedly "new" phone with broken tray and substitute parts  I purchased the phone reported in good condition, but there was no tool to open the SIM port.  This clued me into the phone's unannounced defect: the little SIM tray would not open.  At that time I had left for Europe and took the phone to my Apple repair center and they discovered that the phone had been tampered with and included non-original parts.  The official apple center in Hollnad asked for Euro 360 to repair the phone.  I opted out and relying on cheaper options.  Had the seller warned me of the defect, I would have bought it from a different source and could have been using my new iPhone a month ago.
Absolutely terrible  I'm not sure how this phone gets such great reviews. It is quite possibly one of the most sad and pathetic devices I have ever owned.  Battery life is dreadful, I can barely get through an 8 hour work day with minimal phone use. The home button brings the device out of sleep, so when its in my pocket, I will feel its warm glow on my leg and leading it to the poor battery life. Touchwiz has to be a joke. Shame on Samsung for releasing such a poor quality phone.
I'm very disappointed, this phone isn't unlocked and it turns on and off by itself. Everything you say here is a lie to make people buying trash. I'm so angry
Samsung support is worst: it does not say they will not repair  Used less than 6 months, out of a sudden it cannot boot up, and then it cannot be charged. Samsung support is worst: it does not say they will not repair, it does not say it will, just hang there for 20 days now. Will never buy a single Samsung product forever.
It's waste of money  This is not a Brand New phone. It's a used one. Charger worked only for 3 days then it does not work. The package came without headphones. don't buy this. It's waste of money.
I got the phone use it for 3 days and the battery did not charge any more ! Went to  apple store and told me thatsomething iWong  The phone dint work after 3 days of use  the battery does not charge any more  apple store say its bad something it's wrong with the phone
i bought this phone  and i did not know it was refurbished. also due a malfunction the iphone stop functioning. i need to know if you can refund my money or you can replace it for a new phone.
Inappropriate marketing  The ad does not suggest that this phone can only be registered in australia and if you use it in US you would receive no authorised customer service. So if anything goes wrong with the phone after you purchase there would be no place where you can get it service here in the US. The ad does not mention this. Then if you return it you are charged a minimum of 15% stocking fee. This is fraud.
Amazon is awesome! Samsung's product support is very weak. Think hard about spending this kind of $$$ without a warranty!  This phone was awesome until it stopped working. Almost 6 months to the day after I purchased this phone the screen stopped working. It wasn't frozen, it just would not respond to any input. I looked at my options with the seller for return and repair. Nothing. I called Samsung twice and they said that they couldn't help me. Samsung said that the phone was from Australia and that I needed to call Samsung in Australia? Really! Anyway, this phone does not come with a factory warranty and if it malfunctions you're out of luck. Samsung did not offer me a repair option even if I were willing to pay for it. So, I'm a little smarter now. First, don't spend this kind of money without getting some kind of warranty. Second, Samsung should be take more responsibility for their product's quality and durability. I understand that Samsung makes millions of phone every year and that a lemmon will sometimes make it to the market but they should take care of customers when that occurs. The Nexus 5x is unlocked, much cheaper and comes with a 1 year warranty and you can buy additional coverage for under $70. I miss a few of the bells and whistles that the s6 had but I love the idea that no matter what the reason, if my Nexus 5x fails I'm covered. But, on the other hand there are a few things that the Nexus is better at then the s6. Consumer Reports gave the s6 a test score of 78 and the Nexus 5x a 77. The highest test score was 80 for the s7.
HTC ONE M9  the worst smartphone that i ever buy, since the first day  i receive the phone  the charger didn't work, i have about 2 month with it ,thepower,the volume up and down don't work, when i use the phone it become warm ,this phone is a burden i lost my money.
Why 2 stars? Phone BRICKED - Boot Loop , etc...  Phone lasted about 17 months before she completely bricked. My expectations for a previous generation are not super high but, **I expect at least 24 months of use** (baring any phone drops, water, etc). Had to replace the stock battery about a year after purchase which did solve the boot loop (spontaneous restart) issues the phone was having. This was not a huge issue but did become an inconvenience for me.  So, why did I give 2 stars instead of 1? Because when the phone worked, she worked well! Impressive camera. Processing speed was above average. Micro SD card storage (huge plus). Unlocked so I could use any phone plan. Display was very clear. It is too bad this phone just decided to stop working one day. If you need an Android phone that will last a little over a year, this might be a good option for you. I just ordered the Motorola Nexus 6 to give that one a try....
I thought this phone was new, but it was refurbished. It has a few bugs still.
SMH !  Im sorry but i got my iphone & its horible , the package was bad , and the charger was all scratched and didn't even work ! i had to move it around , so i am RETURNING IT !
Screen has already went out  I really liked this phone when I first got it. Started getting "glitchy" a month or so after having it but didn't think much of it. Screen has now completely went out despite having cover and not dropping. I am stuck with it. Don't bother buying this to save a few bucks. Buy new and get warranty unless you want to replace/buy a new one in a couple of months.
Broken phone, no warranty  The phone was defective right out of the box, the screen is falling off and Samsung doesn't honor the purchase through these guys, so I don't have a warranty.
Dissapointed by this phone  The phone works great, but its only weakness is that it is too fragile: If it falls to the floor, forget about your new phone... I've fixed the screen 2 times and it scratched twice. Thanks for reading, Tom
Kept restarting, I returned and got refunded.
Other than that the phone is really great. The camera is amazing  Be warned, I got this phone from MEGA MOBILE retailers and DID NOT RECEIVE the UK UNLOCKED version which is the 815. I RECEIVED the 815T which is the HONG KONG VERSION. This DOES NOT SUPPORT LTE B2 for T-Mobile which I was expecting as stated on this page.  Other than that the phone is really great. The camera is amazing. Just be aware of which unlocked version you're getting.
Phone's are not new as claimed but refurbished!  Phone's are not new eve though the seller claimed it was!!! I've had the phone for almost a year and always had an issue with putting on a screen protector that I couldn't understand. When I finally went to a store to take care of another issue they opened the phone and told me that it was refurbished and not even that well, the inner insulation was done poorly and dust got in and damaged one of the sensors.
short life  This phone was fabulous when I first got it but it didn't even last me a year. The price was a big selling point for me but it is worth it to spend more on a phone you won't have to replace within the same year.
I bought 2 and both broke exactly 2 years later. Never turn on back. I wil never buy LG again.
Doesn't fit to my need.
Samsung Galaxy S III 3 mini 8GB i8190 HSUPA/HSPDA 900/1900/2100 mps 5MP CAMERA FACTORY UNLOCKED Marble White INTERNATIONAL VERS  The phone has many problems. The battery is damaged, I had to buy a new one. It is difficult to make a call, sometimes stops working and does not receive calls. I went to a Samsung authorized agent and was informed that it is not genuine, it is a copy, so no warranty! Do not buy from this seller is a scammer! Possibly who give score of 5 were lucky that the phone will work but it is still an imitation, it is not the original! I lost my money.  Luis Caracas-Venezuela
Just took it to the Verizon store to get it activated and it is not compatable with Verizon. Do not buy this product if that is your intention
waste of money don't buy  I really hate the fact that this phone has a microphone problem which comes two days after i purchased it. when ever i send voice notes through whatsapp messenger or make a phone call its very low to the point where the person on the line cannot hear what i am saying  at all. this is a very bad experience for me as i am over seas and leaving in a day so i cant send back the phone due to the time frame. this is the main function of the phone and its not working and i realize the its a common problem for HTC phone. waste of my time and money
Phone seems to be nice, but it's power connection is not standard USB  Phone seems to be nice, but it's power connection is not standard USB. I will be returning it since I don't want to be dealing with specialized cables .
This phone was so jacked it. Nothing worked, not ever the sound/vibration smh
Be careful with the NO WARRANTY detail...  After 6 months of use a colored line appeared in the screen overnight. It did not fall or anything like that. After that I used it under water once and took some pics, not for long. The phone is water proof and it should be just fine. It wouldnt charge for 2 days, I had to buy the Samsung pad wireless charger because the issue was with the port. A few days later it was ok to plug inn and phone worked just fine. But 2 weeks later it started showing issues with battery, it wouldnt charge again and at times not even the wireless charger would work. Unfortunately there is no warranty on this phone..
Yuck  Worst phone I have ever used. Glitchy bit of crap. Ignore the price, it's not worth it.
A sleek paperweight; DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!  If you value your money at all, don't buy this phone. I have had some pretty terrible phones in the past, but this is by far the worst. I don't usually write product reviews, but if I could save even one person from making a terrible mistake, it's worth my time. This phone looks nice; it's pretty flat and has a nice display, but there are so many stupid things about it. The power/lock screen button is in the back, for one. It makes trying to lock your screen pretty inconvenient, but you can double tap the screen to lock as well....assuming the screen will respond. I have had this phone for maybe three months now. It is having issues with charging. I will plug my phone into the charger at night before bed, and wake up to find that my battery is at 6%. My charger is plugged in, all this while, so I think it's charging. You can also see that the phone recognizes that the charger is plugged in, from the lightening bolt on the battery. However, it doesn't actually charge. It steadily loses power, during the night. I don't have a landline. My cell phone is the only way to reach me, and several people need to reach me at any given moment. Another huge issue is the microphone port/speakers. When you are talking on the phone and you want to switch to speaker, whoever you are talking with will have a very hard time hearing you. You don't even need to switch to speakerphone to have this issue, actually. At first I thought my mother was being overdramatic, but everyone else started making the same complaint. This phone is a headache; a paperweight; a waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and click the back button to restart your search.
Wi-fi- hardware problem  There was something wrong with the hardware and the Wi-Fi was not working properly. Everything else seemed to be working fine at the time but I was now suspicious of the quality of the materials and the device itself. I tried all the troubleshooting methods but nothing worked so I ended up returning the device. I was so excited to get this phone and now I am so disappointed and sad :(
The battery was messed up,  The battery was messed up, camera didn't work had a billion other problems and as of right now it's turning on and off lol
Avoid: Two flaws, one fatal, can render this phone unusable and there is no recourse  I purchased this phone directly from Google when it first came out and have absolutely loved it. It worked very well the first few months I owned it. Unfortunately, two flaws have emerged that completely disable the phone, and one cannot be fixed.  First issue was that the upgrade to Android version 4.4.2 introduced an error for certain popular applications that use the camera, such as Skype, causing the phone to heat up and the battery to drain in about an hour. Look up "mm-qcamera-daemon"; that's the name of the application that will run constantly, even when you aren't using any camera-related apps or even using the phone at all, and that will completely deplete the battery within two hours. The solution is to uninstall these apps, which is inconvenient and reduces the functionality of the phone. Google's evidently known about this problem since the introduction of the latest version of Android and has yet to fix it.  The second issue, the fatal one, is the "SIM Card Added - please reboot" message. Although it may not affect all that many phones, you will find thousands of posts on this problem. Moreover, at least based on my experience, is that you never know when this problem will rear its ugly head. No one seems to know the source of this problem, whether it's hardware, software, or network related. My guess is it's some unique combination of all three, but the fact of the matter is that it seems to affect primarily the Nexus 5 and not other devices and will render your phone completely unusable. My phone worked nearly perfectly from when I received it in November, 2013 until late April, 2014. Then I took it with me to a new city and as soon as I got off the plane and turned it on, I got this message, and the phone would not connect to the network until I rebooted. Everything was fine after that--for about maybe 5 minutes, or sometime 70 minutes or sometimes 10 minutes, then the message would appear again and the phone would require another reboot to connect to the network again. It doesn't matter if I'm using it or if it's just sitting on a table. Unfortunately, the problem has persisted even after returning home.  I've contacted Google twice about the second problem, once by phone and once by chat. They said I had to go through a series of trouble-shooting steps (all of which I tried, by the way, including testing a different SIM) that they promised to email to me and that are required to be performed before sending out a replacement under warranty. Guess what, I never received the email and, so far, after two attempts, there is no way to get Google to honor the warranty.  If you want this phone, my advice is to purchase it from a place where the warranty will be honored, because Google has not been responsive to my warranty claim. Of course, that's if you're willing to take the risk of having a phone that for unknown reasons can suddenly become completely unusable as a phone.
Iphone 4 32GBrefurshed - Worst piece I have received  I ordered for Apple iPhone 4 32GB (factory unlocked)- refurbished. The piece looks good to see. But the home is not functioning. I am totally disappointed with the seller. I don't know what to do now.
Many scratch on the screen  Scratch the screen ,
I wouldn't recommend anyone to but this  This product was not unlocked. I had to spend hell lot of money trying to get it unlocked. Apparently it was T-Mobile locked, which makes me wonder if this was used before. Also I had to call HTC and T-mobile a million times to understand what the issue was. I wouldn't recommend anyone to but this product
I loved the phone, could not get a single US company to activate it for me!
I will never buy any mobile devices or any other electronic item from amazon. Mostly work only few months and then problem starts
Bricked Itself. Unbelievable.  As a Nexus owner since Google come out with them; I love them. But this 5X just bricked itself for no reason. Appears that thousands upon thousands of Nexus 5x owners got duped as well. No fix.
battery running very fast ,less than one day ,and is shock proof ,but every time i drop the cover come out.
Calidad  Compre 2 telefonos pero uno de os dos se quedo congelado y ahora siempre que loa prengo solo dice Lg y sequeda alli no avanza no se apaga no sirve ninguna funcion
Glass broke after one day of gentle handling  I purchased my phone online through my wireless carrier. The phone arrived 2 days later. The first thing I notice was how thin and fragile feeling it was, which immediately set up a red flag in my mind. As a result, I paid close attention to how I handled the phone and made plans to get a cover the very next day. I activated the phone and fell in love with it instantly. The next day, I pulled the phone out of my pocket as I walked into the wireless store to buy a cover and found the screen had broken while in my pocket. I had not bumped into anything, I had nothing else in my pocket. Additionally, the pants were not tight, so the phone moved around easily in said pocket. My wireless provider would not work with me on getting the screen fixed (told me my only option was to use my insurance) and at the prodding of some friends, I contacted Samsung directly. They told me a cracked screen voids the warranty so any repairs would be chargable. This burns me for two reason: 1. my carrier has a 15 day love or return it policy, which I now cannot use if I discover this phone doesn't meet my needs b/c the screen is cracked. 2. If any other functionality fails during the original warranty period, I have no rights b/c the screen broke and the warranty is now void. I would LOVE to be writing a glowing review of this phone, but instead I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth regarding this so-called "warranty". I will likely steer as far away from Samsung as possible in the future. I had an LG that fell from a 6 foot high railing onto a concrete patio and the only thing that happened was the battery falling out. This fragile hunk of plastic broke in my pocket. I think I'll stick with LG next time... in the meantime, I get to spend the next 18 months with a phone that makes me angry every time I look at it. It's going to be a long 18 months.
Poor reception in weak cell area, send to Europe warrenty  Phone effectively comes without warrenty.  The LTE on this phone does not work in North America.  We had problems with this phone.  We live in a weak cell reception area with a Wilson Booster.  This phone would drop call constantly and had very poor reception compared to all of our other phones including a Moto g3 international version which worked very well here.  The S5 mini kept switching to the wrong carrier and would be available for emergency calls only.  Most of the time it was emergency calls only.  When you did manage to call, it would drop the call after a minute or two.  We have had several iphones and androids over the past few years, none have had any problems like this phone had.  It took us a while to pin down that it was a phone problem and not a setting or our service provider.  We missed the return period by a few days.  The vendor (Cangura) said we would need to send it to Germany for warrenty inspection/ repair, and recommended expedited special shipping because of time and lithium battery.  I did not like this idea, the phone probably works OK in Germany where all the bands work and the signal is strong.  So we would probably pay $60-$100 to ship to Germany, be without the phone for 2 months, only to have it return as "OK".  Cangura refused to take the phone back.  Amazon agreed to take it back even though it was outside of the return period, but charged about $50 restocking.  We subsequently bought the AT&T version of this used on Amazon.  Dramatic difference, (though it unexpectedly came locked), reception is awesome, no comparison to the international version.  But watch condition of phones, ours was very scratched cover does not close completely because of a dent in case.
2 visits to Nokia Care in 6 months - need I say more  Pros 1. Build and Style 2. Nokia Drive / Nokia Maps 3. Display  Cons 1. Unreliable OS 2. Lack of popular apps  Details: My experience with Nokia Lumia is a never ending daily struggle and I regret the fateful decision of ordering a Lumia 800 in December last year. My experiences / issues: 1. The first model received had issues with battery longevity. After a week, Nokia replaced this model with a new one. 2. The new model still had lingering issues with battery longevity. Nokia issued an update that was supposed to fix the problem. However, instead of fixing the issue, it led to a worsening of the issue. First visit to Nokia Care. 3. All is well for couple of months. Suddenly, one fine day Lumia's screen freezes. The issue is discussed at [...]. Another visit to Nokia care. 4. Nokia returns the set claiming that the problem is fixed (however, no explanation of what the problem was and what the fix was). Used the set for two weeks, and again the problem resurfaces and the screen freezes. Another visit to Nokia care in the offering.  Apart from the above, there are number of issues that made me realize how I used to take the absence of the issues for granted in other sets. For example, 1. Intermittent automatic reboots once / twice every 3-4 weeks of usage. It seems that the phone has brain of its own and realizes that it is hosting a Windows OS so a reboot is customary. 2. When ending a call, Lumia will take almost 2-3 minutes before allowing me to the opportunity to redial. 3. USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) does not work, denying me the easy way to check my prepaid balance. Now the only way is to call the Service Providers IVR and go thru the multi-hop mennu system to get the same information. 4. Every update of the OS/firmware release by Nokia wipes my data on the phone, no matter how minor the update.  This even includes all the apps that I would have downloaded.  There are a number of other minor quirks, that I am now willing to overlook - thanks to the issues mentioned above. However, one thing is certain, I am not trying any new Nokia and Windows mobile for the foreseeable future.
negative  buy a new phone and sent me a used one, had a recorded telephone book, not recommended at all. they were not responsible
This phone is pretty nice, I really liked the way it works and feels compared to the other smart phones I have had (iPhone 3, IPhone 4, Samsung s3, Samsung Note 3, iPhone 6plus) this phone is right in the top . It's definitely a very fast phone and everything works great.  Sadly, since the first day I started using the phone this device was getting too hot (105 to 110 Fahrenheit) and I was just making calls and not even using utilities (no other phone I have had got this hot).  I would also add the the battery is not great for me either it drained too fast.  I went for a ride on my vehicle around the city and I started using the GPS, right away the phone got 125 to 135 Fahrenheit!  I would give this phone 5 starts and maybe this experience just occurred to me (I hope so because the phone has so many great reviews) however, I'm going to have to return this item and give this phone a one star rating since I don't want to risk paying 500+ dollars for a phone that is always running this hot.  It might also be that my experience is jut an outlier and it was just bad luck for me with this phone, but it's kind of sad because the phone overall looks great and is pretty fast.
Avoid this product  Phone just entered the "infinite boot loop" issue.  Sending to LG but because this is just out of warranty I'm not expecting them to be a stand up company and do the customer right.  Do not buy LG anything I have had issues with all their products.
As phone kept on blank  Don't buy this phone. I both this phone for a friend and by the second day the phone kept on blanking off on its own the radio is not working it's overheating.
the item doesn't work  the item doesn't work, does't work whit internationals networks. turn on but doesn't turn of... the phone back cover is damaged  I want my money back or I want a item that works right...
Bad Battery.  They sent it with a bad battery. At first its indicator was jacked where it would say it had 64% then it would die, then there would be times where it would say it had 1% and last several hours. Now, the battery can't hold a charge and must stay plugged in at all times to a wall outlet or it will turn off. We've tried with a car charger and it won't stay on with the car charger, only wall outlet.
Samsung GT-i8190 Galaxy S3 Mini 3G 900/1900/2100 factory Unlocked..  The phone you buy unlocked clearly thought this time is that when trying to use is not compatible with any of the operators in my country (Venezuela) seems to me a lack of respect for these people who are not careful with the product you are finally dispatching. I lost my money with you irresponsible people.
The phone just went dead after 9 months of purchase and the seller does not respond to calls.  I had to go back to the Samsung store where they told me that the motherboard needs replacing - out of the blue! And they would only do it free of charge if I can produce proof of purchase/warranty. The invoice I have doesn't carry a part# or an REM# and the warranty card was never signed/stamped by the seller.
I will not buy international unlocked again  If I knew then what I know now I would have bought from my own carrier -UNLOCKED-.  Since this is an International version, (sounds like that should be the best choice) well it is not.  I cannot explain the technology but my USA carrier can only support 3G not the 4G that the phone is capable of.  That is not a big deal since I do not have any problem streaming music or GPS.  For just $75 more I could have gotten it from my carrier with a SIM card included and had 4G. I did not return since I set it up and did not want to go through the hassle. I will not buy international unlocked again.
the charger is not original, and now i cant use my phone becouse it won't work.
Bad, Bad battery for refurbished Nexus5  I bought a refurbished one but after using for one week I decided to returned it. I highly suggest not buy an old phone like this, except for a new one. The biggest issue with the old ones (used, refurbished) is the battery. Shipped with the stock Android, KitKat, the battery is quite bad. Even when the phone is upgraded to Marshmallow with the pretty cool 'doze' feature, the battery still struggles. I put the phone there, screen locked and doing nothing. The battery will drop from 100% to 90% within just twenty minutes. If I keep the screen on for web browsing, it will die pretty pretty pretty soon... I tried to use it during the day but only when I charged it twice or three times (basically in my workplace and home, I kept it charging all the time). To summarize, DONT buy a used/refurbished one!
This tem  not working
Phone was not unlock
Extremely disappointed - dishonest advertisement!!!!  Perhaps its the phone or perhaps it Otterbox. In either case, I have had 2 phones break in my Otterbox in surprising situations. One it fell on a carpet while I was standing up and another time I was exiting my car and it was still attached to my aux. cable and fell about a foot. The LCD screen busted the first time and the screen shattered the second time.  The screen lags quite a bit and I was extremely disappointed that the seller was not honest about the phone modifications regarding the software. My phone came rooted and now I cannot use it while abroad. I guess now that it is broken I have to buy another one anyways and will just get one that woRks while abroad. However, the biggest problem that I had with the phone was the keyboard. It often force quits and I will try to type a sentence but it gets stuck on a letter and types the letter a bagillion times instead of the sentence. Instead of saying - Hey, want to meet up at three? It would type something like - Hey, want to mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Ya I have to say I absolutely loved that feature on top of the fact that the delete button stopped working as well so I'd have to send those idiotic texts and try to type what I really meant to say.  I will never be buying from this seller again DUE to the fact that the phone came rooted and this caused many problems with getting insurance for my phone, having a cell while abroad and maybe was the cause behind the lagging screen.  It's not that I don't like Samsung, but I can't trust in the Galaxy S3 or Otterbox. I have had terrible experiences all around with the two Galaxy S3s I've owned and this particular phone has to be the worst due to the keyboard, my phone being rooted WITHOUT the seller advertising it and well now another broken phone. I've seen people throw their Samsung phones because they placed so much trust in the Otterbox product and well their phone has never broke.  Thanks, but no thanks. I will be staying away from this seller and the Galaxy S3.
Phone has issues....keeps shutting off, won't connect to the internet. If the system needs updating I need to know
Device is not unlocked as stayed in listing deciding whether or not to pay to get it unlocked or just return it.
Needs sim card but why when the description says factory unlock. Phone seems to be in good condition but i can not use it so its worthless
the battery is terrible. Compared with Iphone  i have one for development from company. the battery is terrible. Compared with Iphone, it's a junk.
Faulty Battery  Great phone but the battery that came with it was faulty. Phone shuts off on it's own and can't be restarted unless plugged in. (Even though battery displays that it is charged) Upset that I have to pay for a new battery right out of box.
Didn't work
A defective product  iPhone dead on arrival.
Garbage
slow running system  phone does not hold a charge, did not come with ear buds or manual hardly think its a new item. Phone is rather slow. Wont pull up some web pages but the most annoying thing is having to charge 2 times a day.
Great phone. Be sure to buy it new not used  I love the phone but the battery won't last 9-10 hours without charging it. I feel like I wasted money and should have bought it new
Worst phone instrument ever  Phone stopped working in 6 months. This is the worst ever phone bought with issues of phone set heating up, wireless connectivity issues and niw it goes dead..what a waste of money.
DO NOT BUY. Bricked after Android N update.  The back of the phone, being white, attracts a lot of dirt and also makes noises every time you grab the phone, I knew it was made out of plastic but man, the thing really feels SO cheap. It's important to mention that the phone does get warm, like really warm, specially near the fingerprint reader which can be uncomfortable when you want to unlock it. Considering you won't probably buy the 16 GB version and that the difference between the 32 GB version and the Nexus 6P is 80 USD I think is worth spending a little extra on the 6P.  The only exceptional thing about the phone is the camera, finally a good camera in a Nexus, even without IOS.  ********************UPDATE*********************** DO NOT buy this phone, when updated to Android Nougat the phone enters in a boot loop everytime your try to turn it on, this is due to a hardware malfunction according to Google. You can look for this issue as "Nexus 5X bootloop".
a company with excellent career!  This team came with the battery burnt, I rate negatively, it is not an Apple computer may bring the defect, a company with excellent career!
I'm  disappointment!  The smartphone did not meet my expectations. The camera does not take pictures focused. All photos are out of focus. I lost my money, I'm disappointment. I want my money back. I bought when visiting in new york, I am now in my country. Is a disaster!
Ok
dont buy this phone it sucks  Its slow has problems sending pics text and does not have speak text andriod systems are much better. Dont do it
It was working perfectly fine till the third day  Bought a international version to use in Brazil, where I leave. Asked to my sister to bring it to me from her visit to USA. Just received the phone 4 days ago. It was working perfectly fine till the third day. At the third night I set the alarm oclock and put it to recharge. The nexts morning when I puch the power key, nothing happens, it just won't respond or turn on. Just showed a blue (purple?) light blinking. I tried to reset it in all combination but nothing responds (holding volume down and power buttom, etc). After aproximately 12h the blinking light went off. It also refuses to charge. The warranty doesnt works in Brazil. I have till 20th of this month to return it according Amazon police but I don't know if I can proceed with it, since I am In Brazil and I don't know if it would work to send it back to USA and receive a new one back, in Brazil. Please let me know how could I figure it out. PS.: Just to make it clear, I didn't put it close to any water, even its supposed to be water resistent neither it was dropped while using it during these 3 days. Just made regular use and updated it to android  Nougat 7.0.
Do not buy....  The Phone had issues within a month...when the battery reaches half power, the phone switches off.. Amazon customer care mentioned to contact LG since it's under warranty... LG customer care is telling to go to a shop and try out a different battery... how am I supposed to go to a shop and use a battery and sit there for it to reach 50 % and see what happens.. they are not sure whether it's a battery issue even.. they told if battery swap doesn't work then try to reset the phone..all done still same issue... looks like money gone....I searched for the issue in blogs and found that many people have faced the same issue... it's something with the phone...So everybody is quite aware but don't want to do anything...still trying to get some update from LG team.. if things turn out differently will post it here...
Disappointed in the phone
Had the device for a year and 28 days and now it won't turn back on. Same issue as the others...a week after the update phone froze, shut off and wouldn't turn back on. Still waiting to ship it back to LG. Haven't been able to contact Amazon for help. Don't buy until solution is found.
Battery Never Charged  This new phone is at least 3 - 4 years old and it has a dead battery.  I ordered another device from the same time period and that battery was just fine  The phone never charged; the battery indicator stayed red as it charged for over 12 hours.  The phone never booted up.  DFU mode/restore mode did not help anything; I am familiar with entering iPods, iPhones, and iPads into DFU mode  The computer never recognized the device.  Be ready to install another battery in it or returned it.
I'm not very happy with this phone.  The speaker on the phone was not working proberly. I recently took it to get the speaker fixed. I was told it had water damage. I was not happy with this. The phone was said to be in good condition without any damage.
Not a 4G phone. Will NOT work with U.S. Samsung devices.  We purchased the phone described above. When I purchased a Gear Fit a few weeks later and attempted to pair it, I found out that this phone was not compatible as it was made to be used in the Syrian region and was not considered compatible with any Samsung devices. Samsung would not help at all.  This was also where I found out what the mysterious H+ data connection was and why I wasn't getting 4G LTE... This does not operate on any of the bands required to get it. In other words... This is probably not the unlocked phone you're looking for. You might get lucky and happen to get a model that works, but that's not what I got. Sending it back for a refund.  I will say that the S5 is a great phone otherwise. The fingerprint scanner and heart rate monitor work great, the camera quality is amazing, and the response is wonderful. But I'll not be buying another unlocked phone from Amazon without first doing my homework. Thankfully, T-Mobile stepped up to provide me with a proper phone on the July 4th holiday. I just hate that I'll have to wait a few days before I can use my new Gear Fit.
DO NOT BUY!!! Screen hardware issues. BEWARE OF THE WIRELESS PLACE!!!  After only less than 3 weeks of use, this phone has developed a screen problem. For a product that you pay over $500 for, one a long quality service from it. Dont know what to do now, as it seems like Im out over $500.  UPDATE!!! Just contacted the seller WIRELESS PLACE. I bought the device in July, although I didn't even open the box until my trip in September (I purchased the phone to use abroad), which means I got less than 3 weeks of use. I explained this to the seller, and I was told that since its passed the return period, though luck.
The phone was not worth the purchase, I ended going out to buy another phone
