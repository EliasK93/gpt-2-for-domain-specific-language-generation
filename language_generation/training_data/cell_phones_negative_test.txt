Buyer Beware -- Manufacturer does NOT stand behind it.  Please, please do not buy this phone.  The manufacturer will NOT stand behind it.  I purchased it new on March 2017 and it worked fine until January 2018.  I was unable to make calls or text due to the phone getting stuck in airplane mode.  Even though I would turn off airplane mode and it appeared off in settings, the phone thought it was still in airplane mode.  I did everything I could to rectify even resetting to factory settings (which means losing all pics and data BTW).  Finally called manufacturer who agreed that this was a known problem with their phone.  They offered 2 solutions: (1) put a 399.99 hold on my credit call while they send me out a REFURBISHED phone-- not NEW-- or (2) send back my phone for repair meaning no access to a phone for 2 weeks.  She said if they could not repair then I would get a REFURBISHED replacement phone.  When you pay 426.99 for a brand new phone, you would hope that the manufacturer would offer a replacement NEW phone or a refund not a REFURBISHED phone.  Please save yourself from the grief and frustration that I went through over this phone and choose another.
Defective unit. GPS does not work.  Defective. GPS stopped working a few days after I could not return it.
Not US Region model!!!  My HTC One was sold by "Masterdeals" and came as a new (unopened) phone, but I faced something that I never expected 2 days ago when I contacted HTC USA support since I could not update my phone to Android 4.4. The phone I have had Spanish region software in it although it was advertised as a US unlocked device. Now, I am stuck with a phone that does not have US software in it, so the fate for the next upgrades are totally unknown. If I want to get the updates, then I have to void my warranty and change the ROM and root my device, which I definitely don't want before my warranty ends. Therefore, please AVOID this seller for any cost. I never thought that I would face with this kind of thing with a legitimate purchase from Amazon.com.
I ordered this and received an AT&T phone which is functionally useless on the T-mobile network as it cannot send or receive group texts or images.  This is a known issue and the ways to get around it require a great deal of technical knowledge and can kill the phone entirely if you make a mistake.  T-mobile users especially should stay away.
horrible, horrible phone. freezes occasionally and the battery has to be removed to restart.
Volume buttons don't work. Battery drains fast
A month after, the screen needs to replace. Waste
Fraud.  Phone was neither new nor functional!  FRAUD.  Firstly, the phone was not new; it was USED.  Even worse, it DIDN'T WORK!.  The phone never charged properly.  I took it to a national phone repair chain and they found corrosion by the charge port.  Having removed the corrosion, the phone started to charge enough for them to turn it on, only for us to the the blue screen of death.  So this phone was neither new nor functional!  Complete waste of money!  Don't make the same mistake I did!
This product Bricked on me after 4 months......I thought I bought it brand new so I'm just out of all of my money.
THIS PHONE SUCKS!  This phone absolutely sucks, forget all the hype, it's the biggest piece of junk that has ever existed. I'm switching from a Nexus 5 that survived 2 years and never had an issue (my girlfriend now uses it), and I wish I hadn't "upgraded."  First issue: it almost forces you to use the thumbprint which doesn't work when it's wet. Yes it has a backup pin, but it sometimes doesn't give you the option if you get the thumb "wrong" enough times. About a month ago I was trying to find a friends house and needed to call/text him to get the house #; I was outside and it was pouring rain. Of course the thumb print doesn't work, and it never gave me the option to put in my pin, so what's it do? It locks me out for 30 seconds. Guess what? You only have 1 try to get it right the next time, even though I dried it and myself the best I could under an awning, try 2 doesn't work, so it locks me out for 1 minute, repeat, but this time it locks me out for 5 minutes, repeat, IT LOCKS ME OUT WHEN I'M IN THE RAIN TRYING TO FIND MY FRIENDS HOUSE FOR 30 MINUTES! LUCKILY, I finally got it to work after being outside for an hour in the pouring rain fiddling with this useless thing.  Second Issue: My camera lens randomly smashed. I can narrow it down to a 30 minute window when it happened and there was no hard impact that would have done it. I've read other comments of people with similar issues; the lens is very cheaply made.  Third Issue: The text/messaging notification takes up about 30% of the screen when you get a text and there's NO WAY TO TURN IT OFF! No matter what, if you're using your phone and someone sends you a text/skype/whatsapp, a third of your screen gets covered by it. On the nexus, it's a little line across the top that doesn't get in the way of what you were already doing, like reading an article/e-mail or playing a game. You also don't just get one on the first unread message, they just keep coming and coming and coming.  Fourth Issue: This is the one that put me over the edge and made me write this review. Even though this phone is water resistant, I treat it like every other phone that I've ever had and act like it's not. About 2 weeks ago it started randomly not charging saying that it detected moisture in the port; it hasn't been in the rain or any other situation where it's gotten wet! It decides to do this,  and sometimes after rebooting it's worked, sometimes I just let it sit on the charger and come back hours later and it's worked; it's always fixed itself in the past. However, last night it started giving me this message. I've waited and waited and waited, and restarted and restarted and restarted, and IT'S STILL NOT CHARGING AND GIVING ME THE MESSAGE!!!! I went so far as to turn it off and use a hair dryer on the port, and tried again, IT STILL DOESN'T WORK.  THIS PHONE SUCKS!
Screen cracked by itself!!  Own this s7 edge for less than week,  screen just cracked right where edge begin, there was no impact, it was on table last I saw it it was fine, then picked up and see crack I owned 10 phones, never had cracked screen issues, this is first
It's working but I'm not happy with it  So the truth is that it is working I bought a used one. But it's fully with dents and scratches the screen is ok but everything around is bad bad. And it takes very long to charge and the battery goes out fast. If I wold have extra time I wold send it back but I don't have the time for it. I can't stay without a phone any more so I'm not sending it back but really I need a refund. Or at least for the half price refund. So if I will get back a refund or something I will update my review and will let you know my experience,
The phone is not working...
I bougth an iPhone 5s and the details said that, It was Brand new, But they iPhone have some defects.  When they said that was 100% New .If Will know that It was a terrible buy i Will rather spend my Money in other options.
Very disappointed, I brought this for my husband for an early father day gift, and it would not take his Sim card, even though it said it was universal,.. It was an HTC phone and it was not mention in the discription.
Not Unlocked  The iPhones were NOT unlocked and did not work.  I had to return them.
terrible buy.  The phones charger port was not working properly when I got it..the battery also dies in about two hours...terrible buy..no wonder there's no warranty on this piece of junk
Did not work. Died the next.
Bad phone had tones of problems couldn't get my money back
don't like it it stop working after 4 month of use
worst service ever  horrible service phone does not work is locked
i love it i can't complain its clean and has less scratches  i love it thanks much and i love doing business with you!!!
Sucked, gets hot and won't stay charged if you take it off the charger! Won't be getting another phone from off here!
BAD UNIT. Overall decent phone if you can find one that works.  The camera sensor came in messed up. Alot of these refurb phones are not fixed properly.
very bad  not unlocked. in Venezuela does not work with any telephone company. and the seller has not solved anything. when I got it set up and tested with wireless internet (worked very well), when delivered as it was for my mother's birthday did not recognize any simcard from the phone companies have. asks for a network unlock pin. THE PHONE IS BLOCKED
Don't expect to have room for apps.  When I ordered I didn't realize that purchasing external storage wouldn't work for most apps; especially the ones already installed.  I just got it and am constantly getting a *storage is almost full* warning.  I would not order again and unfortunately it is past the return date.  I don't feel that the way it was advertised was very clear for anyone not tech savvy that there would be practically 0 storage.  I rarely but a new phone and only upgraded so that it would work with fit bit; otherwise I would go back to my J3.  Pretty bummed overall...
Not just Unlocked GSM phone, it's an AT&T phone and doesn't work with anything else  I love S6, we have two already but...I returned this one.  I was under the impression that I'm buying just an Unlocked GSM Galaxy S6 but this came pre-configured for AT&T.  I got it working with H2O, which was my goal all along, and I was initially going to overlook all the AT&T bloatware but it wouldn't let me update Android.  Somehow it is hooked into AT&T update and it kept telling me that I'm up to date even though the S6 came with Android 5.11, at least 3 years out of date.  There's no way to get H2O to update the software.  I feel Amazon misrepresented what this phone is.  This is an AT&T phone, not an Unlocked GSM phone.
I am very upset because the phone I received was not dual sim and was not unlocked.
Buyer be ware ! listed as unlocked : wrong. Found out it must be activated via a (north/central/south)  American carrier. AND a call must be made of duration greater than 5 minutes from this region. This means you cannot buy it and start using it in india, australia, japan, china, europe, etc.... All those reviewers who gave it a 5 star, operated the phone in the americas or caribbean. you have to break the box seal to get at the user manual to find out that the device only accepts Micro Sims. So you cannot transfer a regular sim from your old phone (unless you want to gamble and try to cut the old sim card down to size). I had originally contacted the seller and received assurance that it was an international phone. Amazon agreed to refund my full cost (including shipping)
I purchased a phone listed as NEW. It came convincingly packaged in an Apple box with accessories.  When the camera quit working the person who repaired it told us (and showed us) that it had been poorly refurbished. Buyer beware.
Good phone UNTIL it got a constant malfunction with T-mobile (antenna is not working often). Went to T-mobile with this and got this feed back. Disappointed...
sorry I'm very upset  The phone was good the first 2 weeks but after that I can't turn the phone on
sent me a remanufactured phone  I had problems with the shipping company and to date I receive it today, I get a mobile repowered, I think of very low reputation make this scam
very disappointed, cell not get full  very disappointed , cell not get full , I miss the sim tray , and my biggest problem living in Ecuador
BE ADVISED THIS 'NEW' 16GB (HA!) PHONE COMES WITH 5 GB OF UN-REMOVABLE ATT BATTERY DRAINING BLOATWARE AND IS USED/REFURBISHED  Anyone considering purchasing this based on the (generic no carrier logo) images shown should be advised the 16gb phone is actually an unlocked att phone (stamped on back plate) and is loaded with un-removable att bloatware that takes up almost 5 gb of memory. After accidentally shattering the screen on my 5 month old T-mobile Galaxy S3, I SPECIFICALLY (foolishly) went with this seller as opposed to another (cheaper) seller because I  DID NOT WANT an ATT phone, having dealt with their un-removable bloatware in past eating up huge chunks of memory and batter power; these programs can be 'force stopped.turned off, but restart on next powering on..  I now have basically spent $140 (incl tax) on what is essentially an 8gb phone loaded with battery draining att unneeded, unwanted, useless programs that I absolutely hate.  Classic case of buyer beware. -.-  Edited to add: Additionally, in examining the phone, although it was sold as 'new', it is clearly USED/REFURBISHED. The lens over the camera is chipped on one side and scratched, and the earphone jack has clearly been used numerous times, as has the usb/charging port at the bottom.
This seller does not honor warranties!!!  This seller does not honor warranties. Do not buy from Wireless Electronics USA. This phone did not make it to a year and suddenly stopped working. Seller will not honor the apple warranty.
was not at all satisfied with the device because it came wit an obvious software problem, the notification bar that drops down keeps dropping without me actually touching the phone, its a real distraction when you are trying to use the device, and this device was guaranteed brand new, since i am new to shopping on amazon i do hope this does not persist in the future
BEWARE BUYERS! USED PRODUCT  Truth is, phone works well, but it came with a preloaded video, disgusting and degenerate, not even porn, worse, unhuman things, some people may find it funny, i don't know, but i bought a new unused phone and instead, i received a loaded phone, with disgusting videos, and i wonder everyday what would had happened if the phone was a gift for my daughter and she saw that disgusting video of nude people doing disgasting things i should not explain on this review. And i am not speaking about pornography, or sexuality, its a unhumain video.
not good.  I placed an order for the new. But you gave me the second-hand. Reputation is so bad, it is difficult to have cooperation.
no headphones  In the picture theres headphones but when i recieved my order no headphones.
BEWARE as fragile as glass  Just to warn other customers, I am terrible disappointed in the quality of this phone. It dropped only 2 feet, and all the screen has a big crack on it now. Very surprised with this lack of quality from a Samsung phone. I have own a Captivate and an HTC, and they have been more durable than this. This lack of quality really feels like a joke from Samsung on the customers, paying over $300 for a phone which the screen easily breaks like that? I haven't had the phone more than 2 weeks and now the screen is broken. Reading online, as a weird exception from the other Samsung phones, this one doesn't come with Gorilla Glass. So buyer beware, if you drop this phone THE SCREEN WILL BREAK. Very dissapointed in this phone, don't buy it.
Scratch on my gorilla glass. How come?  I don't know how it is possible but Samsung galaxy Sii with gorilla glass has a scratch on its visor. Probably because it is not a real gorilla glass. Poor Samsung. It will never be an apple. I am still waiting an answer from you about that. Thanks
Not good  It was not what i expected. There was sn issue with the screen (big issue) also there is a problem with the log on. Too many bumps...a really bad Quality used iPhone. I wish they could turn me back my money. I feel scamed
False advertising in the specifications.. only 550mb of RAM  The description on the product clearly states it has 1gb of ram yet. Mine was always freezing and generally slow, and then I noticed they mine only has 550mb of RAM. I don't recommend the product, you won't get what you paid for and were expecting. Bought from aSavings.
Great phone better than the old one  I love the new updates on this phone than the old iPhone 3 but there were a few miner issues n One BIG issue! I've had it now for 3 weeks almost 4, when I got it I was pleased to see they wrapped it up good and was just what the picture description says it is except the 16 GB it's a 13 n was all in Chinese so took some time changing it since I can't read Chinese n there were no instructions for it. The Mayjor issue is it goes in n out of signal it will go from perfect signal to no signal n drop my calls. Went two days with it saying no signal searching! I've never had that issue til I got this phone! Other than those issues it's a very nice phone. Had no scratches. The screen being smaller I hate but definitely better than my old IPhone. Pictures look more professional n clear. Repost: Phone stopped working completely had to take it to an iPhone store in Greenville found out it wasn't an original iPhone. Seller took pieces of an iPhone and refurbished it to sell as a iPhone. It isn't an iPhone do not buy. Its a scam.
keep it pack of s***
really a bad cell phone arrived damaged at all do not recomnend to anyone
