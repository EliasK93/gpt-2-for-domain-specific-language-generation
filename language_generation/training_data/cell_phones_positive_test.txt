Nice phone, I have LG 2 before so this is kind upgrade. Type C charger only took less an hour made full charge.
five stars!!!!!!!!  I love this phone. No need to upgrade to an iPhone 6. This phone is perfect.
Excellent product.  Excellent
Great buy.  The large screen isn't 1080p but it's still excellent for watching HD video.  I haven't had any problems with lagging either.  Tremendous battery life and a micro sd slot for storage make this the ultimate flying companion.  I watched a full length movie on a recent flight before renting a car at the airport and driving for 3 1/2 hours using the phone as my GPS, without plugging it in.  There was still plenty of battery life left when I arrived.  Other notable features include settings to limit apps access to your mobile data and an FM tuner.  The tuner requires the use of headphones, the wire acts as the antenna.  Finally the device does not limit the volume using headphones, you can turn it up to uncomfortable levels if you like.  Overall great device.

Awesome phone  Very well packaged and item is as described very satisfied with this purchase
Cool gadget
best phone  Just as expected, best phone
Great phone.  I'm used to the full size version of Samsung mobiles so I find typing using swype more difficult because of the space between keys. I'll probably get used to it eventually though.

AMAZING  ABSOLOUTLEY STUNNING. WOW I AM IMPRESSED !!. I hate ordering phones offline especially used ones but this badboy might as well be brand new.  I mean the plastic was still on the camera....thank you guys so much  even tho I live in alaska I received my item promptly. Beautiful. My only tip would be factory reset the phones before you ship them mine has some music videos in it still.although there videos I already enjoy so it was actually a bonus AGAIN THANK YOU !!!
Price was good and I'm using it now.
Excelent
Im happy with my cell phone
She told me how impressed she were with the galaxy note 4 so much so that I fell in love with the device myself  When the galaxy note 4 was released in 2014 my sister upgraded to a AT&T model from a galaxy S4 from the same carrier. She live in the USA and I'm living in Jamaica. She told me how impressed she were with the galaxy note 4 so much so that I fell in love with the device myself. I myself could only afford a galaxy grand 2 duos that year. Now I found the price for a used galaxy note 4 is more affordable for me and so I buy 2, one for my neighbor and one for myself. I'm loving my Note 4.
Very Good
Awsome for the price  This phone is still very popular and can do many things, and it has the original classic look. Would recommend to Freind
It was so great. Thank You very much  It was so great.  Thank You very much.

Solid alternative to the Galaxy S6  Full disclosure, I'm a fan of Samsung phones. With that being said, I have had problems with previous models: Galaxy S5 Active not being as "rugged" as advertised and the poor battery life of the Galaxy S6 leaving you to make strategic power saving decisions later in the day.  That in mind, the Galaxy J7 greatly exceeded my expectations while being a fraction of the price as the more mainstream models.  The phone is slightly larger than a Galaxy S6 and considerably smaller than the Galaxy Note which is nice if you want a larger screen without all the bulk. I like the larger screen because my fat thumbs constantly hit the wrong keys on smaller screens.  The screen quality is just as good as the Galaxy S6 if not better. I would recommend getting a phone case with a kickstand so you watch your Netflix and youtube videos without having to hold it.  My model did come with dual sim card ports which will be nice for travelling abroad, but I have read that only certain models have the dual ports so make sure you compare model numbers to get what you want.  My only complaint is that it isn't 4G/4G LTE compatible with AT&T (or at least not where I'm located in the Pacific NW). I've heard of others accessing 4G networks but it doesn't work for me. But the H+ network (seems to be slightly faster/same speed as 3G) works great for most of my needs.  Best of all is the long battery life. With light to medium use it will easily last 1.5-2 days no problem.  Overall I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to people looking for a solid alternative to the Galaxy S6.
great phone  Great phone. Would definitely recommend.
as good as new  I took some four months to provide this feedback because i thought I should give the device some time to test before saying a word. And so after four months of use, I am extremely pleased with the phone, delivery time and response received from the supplier. I would definitely buy again from the supplier and can recommend them to anyone.
Very good
Good One  I realy like it. Right size & performance. I realy like it. Right size & performance. I realy like it. Right size & performance
