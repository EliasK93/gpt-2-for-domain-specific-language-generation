Nice phone, I have LG 2 before so this is kind upgrade. Type C charger only took less an hour made full charge.
five stars!!!!!!!!  I love this phone. No need to upgrade to an iPhone 6. This phone is perfect.
Excellent product.  Excellent
Great buy.  The large screen isn't 1080p but it's still excellent for watching HD video.  I haven't had any problems with lagging either.  Tremendous battery life and a micro sd slot for storage make this the ultimate flying companion.  I watched a full length movie on a recent flight before renting a car at the airport and driving for 3 1/2 hours using the phone as my GPS, without plugging it in.  There was still plenty of battery life left when I arrived.  Other notable features include settings to limit apps access to your mobile data and an FM tuner.  The tuner requires the use of headphones, the wire acts as the antenna.  Finally the device does not limit the volume using headphones, you can turn it up to uncomfortable levels if you like.  Overall great device.

Awesome phone  Very well packaged and item is as described very satisfied with this purchase
Cool gadget
best phone  Just as expected, best phone
Great phone.  I'm used to the full size version of Samsung mobiles so I find typing using swype more difficult because of the space between keys. I'll probably get used to it eventually though.

AMAZING  ABSOLOUTLEY STUNNING. WOW I AM IMPRESSED !!. I hate ordering phones offline especially used ones but this badboy might as well be brand new.  I mean the plastic was still on the camera....thank you guys so much  even tho I live in alaska I received my item promptly. Beautiful. My only tip would be factory reset the phones before you ship them mine has some music videos in it still.although there videos I already enjoy so it was actually a bonus AGAIN THANK YOU !!!
Price was good and I'm using it now.

Im happy with my cell phone
She told me how impressed she were with the galaxy note 4 so much so that I fell in love with the device myself  When the galaxy note 4 was released in 2014 my sister upgraded to a AT&T model from a galaxy S4 from the same carrier. She live in the USA and I'm living in Jamaica. She told me how impressed she were with the galaxy note 4 so much so that I fell in love with the device myself. I myself could only afford a galaxy grand 2 duos that year. Now I found the price for a used galaxy note 4 is more affordable for me and so I buy 2, one for my neighbor and one for myself. I'm loving my Note 4.
Very Good
Awsome for the price  This phone is still very popular and can do many things, and it has the original classic look. Would recommend to Freind
It was so great. Thank You very much  It was so great.  Thank You very much.

I purchased this phone for my son for Christmas and he loves the phone
It's a very good phone and everything run ok  Everything was ok. The seller send the phone very quickly. It's a very good phone and everything run ok. I recommend the product and the seller.
Solid alternative to the Galaxy S6  Full disclosure, I'm a fan of Samsung phones. With that being said, I have had problems with previous models: Galaxy S5 Active not being as "rugged" as advertised and the poor battery life of the Galaxy S6 leaving you to make strategic power saving decisions later in the day.  That in mind, the Galaxy J7 greatly exceeded my expectations while being a fraction of the price as the more mainstream models.  The phone is slightly larger than a Galaxy S6 and considerably smaller than the Galaxy Note which is nice if you want a larger screen without all the bulk. I like the larger screen because my fat thumbs constantly hit the wrong keys on smaller screens.  The screen quality is just as good as the Galaxy S6 if not better. I would recommend getting a phone case with a kickstand so you watch your Netflix and youtube videos without having to hold it.  My model did come with dual sim card ports which will be nice for travelling abroad, but I have read that only certain models have the dual ports so make sure you compare model numbers to get what you want.  My only complaint is that it isn't 4G/4G LTE compatible with AT&T (or at least not where I'm located in the Pacific NW). I've heard of others accessing 4G networks but it doesn't work for me. But the H+ network (seems to be slightly faster/same speed as 3G) works great for most of my needs.  Best of all is the long battery life. With light to medium use it will easily last 1.5-2 days no problem.  Overall I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to people looking for a solid alternative to the Galaxy S6.
great phone  Great phone. Would definitely recommend.
as good as new  I took some four months to provide this feedback because i thought I should give the device some time to test before saying a word. And so after four months of use, I am extremely pleased with the phone, delivery time and response received from the supplier. I would definitely buy again from the supplier and can recommend them to anyone.
Very good

is a good phone, nokia and windows is a perfect duo
100% works
another great Apple product
Useful information on this phone  1. Very good value if you pay less than USD $300 2. Superb build quality and looks 3. Fast, works great and decent batterly life (one day) 4. The screen is beautiful and the colors are great (a little unnatural but great to the eye) 5. Apps and personalization are limited compared to iphone and andriod phones. If you are the type of person who uses their phone for the basics, this is hard to beat. 6. The carmera is very good
Nice phone
very good price
It's just what I need.  Delivery was superb.
Great Phone  I love this phone. It's easy to operate and has a lot of great apps. It looks very sharp. The battery life is excellent. You don't have to keep charging this phone. If you're older, the buttons are super easy to read. It plays fantastic music and videos on it. You can watch movies and listen to music. The screen is so large that you won't have any problem seeing the video. It's a big phone but that's exactly what I wanted. I was able to find plenty of accessories to fit this phone. They have protective covers and screen covers too. There are lots of leather covers for carrying in ladies purses. My husband loves how easy it is to carry. It fits in his front pocket easily. Very slim and very classy looking phone.
it's good
Best phone for 2016  I couldn't ask for a better phone than this.  Beats all the hype it had surrounding the "nexus" line
Apple the best !  This product is very nice product from Belkin !!! WONDERFUL PRODUCT !!! PERFECT !!!! Buy without any confidence !!! Apple is the best.... Everybody knows !!!!

Quick shipment and good quality
this phone is simply amazing,
Apple iPhone 4S Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB  It was good.
Glad I didn't have to give a penny to AT&T  the phone is exactly as anticipated. I already dropped the phone from 5 feet onto concrete and it suffered no damage. I could have used a locked phone from AT&T since I use consumer cellular but the very rude clerk at the first AT&T store I tried wouldn't sell me one. This unlocked one was the same price that AT&T listed it for and has AT&T markings on it. Glad I didn't have to give a penny to AT&T. I did however expect to  get some sort of simple start up user guide. It didn't come with any such thing. I bought a galaxy6s for dummies which has similar content to what I expected to get with the phone.
Very good and fast
perfect
Happy w/ my Samsung Mini  It works fine with AT&T and I like that it small and fits in my pocket with no trouble.
Great product!!!! Very good. Perfect

Upgrading from a Nexus 6  It is a bit smaller than my N6 but I don't really notice that anymore. The fingerprinter scanner is amazing! It is also a lot faster than my old N6. It is sleek, thin, and light with an amazing battery life (I can get 2 days between charges with moderate use). I've owned 2 HTCs and while I do like Sense UI, stock Android is the only way to go for me any more. I'd be hard pressed to buy another non-Nexus phone in the future. This is one of, if not the best, high end Android phone currently available.
Excellent!  Phone was in pristine condition. I am extremely pleased.
Getting Another One!!  I'm about to order a new one. I've had this phone for over four years and I've rarely had any problems with it. The issues I did have were very minor. I'm sticking with the Lumia 635 because it's inexpensive, it works well for my needs, and I know the phone.
Grab a certified refurbished note 3 instead.  Good value. I'd grab a certified refurbished note 3, though. For the same price, the note 3 rocks this thing. Though,  the gold j7 is not a bad phone by any means.
Great phone with added things!  Received it earlier than I expected. Came with a case, charger, and a touch pen thingy. Do not regret purchasing at all. Thank you!
On time and very good product.
Great phobe!  It was delivered fast. Great phobe!;)
This gadget works excellent. I use it when I go on my jogs. It was a little tricky getting it down loaded and hooked up to blue tooth and the ear phones, but with a "techy" type of friend of mine we got it figured out in a short period of time. This is a nice piece of equipment that can can hold oodles (16GB) worth of music. I do not regret purchasing a device that has a lot of storage space, and is easy to use. It is so much nicer than my older version of the iPod.

Received my new phone and I love it  This is my first time using Note II, it's easier to operate and so good to open and reading a webpage. Think I will use it for a long time.
Better than the 6 for sure  I remember when the first iPhone came out, and thinking to myself, I was on seventh heaven and this couldn't get better. Now, here we are 8 years in and it's really gotten good. I've owned a 2G, 3G, 3GS, 4, 4S,5s, 6. I've never owned a 5, so I cannot say if that's a good or bad phone, although knowing my experiences with the aforementioned, I'm going to have to say it was as good as them. Let's start with the cons first, as I'm sure that's what draws people in to reviews mostly. They already know or figure they know the positives. This is the preface I used on the iPhone 6 review that I once wrote, and this is the same that I'll continue on using for this particular iteration.  I purchased this phone VERY unexpectedly after being forced to Sprint by work. I picked up with phone after 4-5 Android's recently as I was ready for a change. There still are a few cons that I have with this phone and the 6's cons (1 still stands, that being no easily set songs as ringtones). As far as reception goes, Band 12 is now supported on the 6S on all networks, and I get great reception. Better than I did with my S6 Edge.  The first con would again be, no personalization options by way of setting songs as ringers; unless that is of course you wanted to set them directly from iTunes, which is a royal pain. I liked that you could just set them on the Android phones and be done. This involves a TON of cumbersome converting and in the end is not worth the pain, but there are a lot of preloaded ringtones that actually don't seem to be all that bad, and most of the time, anyway, my phone is on vibrate.  I have been pleased to get a Peel Add on, so I can now use this as my remote. I don't understand why MORE people don't complain about this feature missing on the iPhones. I've grown to accept the fact it won't be available for now (maybe forever) and just gotten a converter add on. I've seen in other reviews people complaining about the fact that some people still wish to have this feature. Let me tell you something, I REALLY have used Infrared since getting a smartphone, so what if it's old technology it's still very useful.  I have been pleased with this phone so far, and everything has been fixed that the past generation didn't "fix." If you need any other clarifications as to what my original issues were, my original review is submitted below from the original 6. You should be glad to know also, that ALL of your accessories including most cases (excludes a couple of lifeproofs) will fit this phone.  I remember when the first iPhone came out, and thinking to myself, I was on seventh heaven and this couldn't get better. Now, here we are 8 years in and it's really gotten good. I've owned a 2G, 3G, 3GS, 4, 4S,5s, 6. I've never owned a 5, so I cannot say if that's a good or bad phone, although knowing my experiences with the aforementioned, I'm going to have to say it was as good as them. Let's start with the cons first, as I'm sure that's what draws people in to reviews mostly. They already know or figure they know the positives.  Cons: The first being, can't Apple include a IR band/sensor already? I've had this complaint since the 5S review if you return to the one I made on that. I'd like Smart Remote to work like it did on my GALAXY S5 (my remote doesn't work for the tv) but this one wants you to connect via wifi or buetooth network, or buy an additional case. Therefore, it has no use as a remote, unless you buy an Apple TV, which knowing me and my "devotion" to Apple, I'll end up buying one just to see this work. But truly, I was a little irked that this wasn't an included feature  The fact you cannot have a downloaded ringtone unless you pay for it also irks me a bit (to get it directly) I paid enough for my phone, with hard earned money, and am expected to pay more for ringtones, or download from a sketchy site which I then have to download into iTunes, when someone could just send me one or I could make one from one of my songs on my Droid. I'm now stuck with sound effect apps and what preloads do come on the phone, although this is not a big con, as my phone is mostly on vibrate.  The thinness, while a cool design feature, bugs me that I think I'll bend my phone. Luckily, I had a case within the 3rd day I owned the phone, but the first two days, after watching the "bendgate" issues unfold, had me petrified.  When inside of an App with audio, such as YouTube or Instagram, if you're near mute on the volume, and a text or call comes in, the volume comes in at the volume the media is playing, and not what level the ringer is set at.  The fact that despite being 8 years in, and many people complaining from what I've seen, if I'm using online email on Safari (one of my accounts isn't supported in mail) it only displays the first page, no matter what I do. It works in Chrome, but it's laggier for some reason in the email. I just wish it worked in Safari, as IMHO, that's the best browser on the iPhone.  Now for the Pros: which is everything else, but to name my favorites: I liked the S health app on my S5 and I really didn't think there was anything better. I'd wanted an App that could do my blood pressure as I ran, counted steps and calories killed (I'm big into fitness) and the stock health app didn't cut it for me. I am happy to say I found a new app called Withings which works just as well if not better than the S Health app, if anyone misses S health, you'll love Withings.  I love the camera! Even though I had a 16MP on the S5, it, to me, still looked blurry. I messed with exposure settings and it still didn't work. I got a warranty replacement which had the same problem. I got this, and it just works. For an 8MP, it just looks so much better. Nothing grainy or washed out.  The retina display is amazing. Forgetting the fact you're on a 4.7'' screen, you could mistake yourself as sitting in a movie theater. The video and sound quality is fantastic. The best audio I've had on a phone. Add in the TWC app, and you can stream your TV on the go, great feature.  The battery is the best I've seen out of any iPhone I've owned. I'm a power-user averaging 600 minutes a month, 5 of my 6 gigs, and maybe 5000 texts, plus wifi usage, and I average 1-2 days max before needing a recharge. I've abandoned having a car charger any longer and can just rely this holds it's charge. I travel a lot for work and this doubles as my GPS and works great, battery never lets me down.  The screen is finally bigger, and the phone at least has a different form factor. Coming from seeing the 4s AND 4 looking alike, the 5 and 5s looking alike, the 3g and 3gs looking alike, it's nice to see change. I would never go for the 6+ based on the fact I don't want to spend the extra money and don't care for a bigger phone such as that.  Despite it's shortcomings which I wish could be addressed, it's really a good phone, and it's a lot better than what Apple started on. While this is one of the better phone's I've owned, and while many people may hate on Apple, you have to think of it this way, you can have your Lumia, or Droid in your pocket, but they wouldn't have half of the features they have today, without Apple and how they pioneered the cellular industry. It doesn't matter the OS the phone runs, IMO, Jobs started it all, with the invention of the iPhone and people and other manufacturers worked off of the idea. So, if you criticize one product and say it's better than the other, it's kinda formed on the same principles.  Hope you enjoyed my review, and if it helps, upvote it :)
This a great phone it does everything that I like for the price.
In LOVE with my new phone  In LOVE with my new phone. Great features. I had to change my SIM card since this one use a bigger one. Just went to T-Mobile and they changed it. Great phone.

Good cell  This cell did not buy it for my use but facilitated the purchase to a friend. He tells me that the phone it worked very well and did not probelmas to turn in our country (Ecuador)
Very nice phone.
It is beautiful, original and works perfectly  It is beautiful, original and works perfectly. The thing is that this is the model sold in Africa (or international version, G925F). That is why it is even cheaper than the s6 flat. It works with more bands than the US version (G925I), so you can use it almost everywhere in the planet. You will only have to change the date and time settings and buy a US charger,  everything else is the same than the US and Latinamerican version. It was worth the  $300 saved buying this version instead of the G925I.
Awsome job, Amazon!!  Well delivered!! Good job!!

Love my new phone.

An excellent mobile indeed !!!  This mobile is exceptionally good with all it's features and performance. Camera quality is excellent with 13 MP and 5 MP. I just don't carry my digital camera after getting this mobile as the pictures are clear. Audio is good. Dual sim option is another feature which attracted me towards this mobile. I was using 2 mobiles and need to get rid of one s it is difficult to maintain 2 mobiles. And this one, as advertised, is working well with 2 SIM cards / networks. It's been few months now I started using this mobile and didn't find any issues with it till date. Happy that I own a fantastic mobile for a decent price. Definitely recommended.
Loving my new cell...the bad thing is Once I bounght this cell the newer version is avalaible :(
excellent phone
Great deal
Superb!  Looks good as new! The phone came with absolutely no scrathes or dents. Been using it for a week, no problems encountered. Everything works fine. Looove it! I definitely recommend!
have it for 2 1/2 month - works great - has some little issue with the "battery fully charged" alert, but otherwise all good. I am glad that i purchased LG G3 over Galaxy s5 - saved money and have same or even better quality.
iPhone 4s  The phone met my standards as to what I needed and I like it very much. I would reccomendation this phone to others.
I love it
great service good product so far  great service  good product so far thanks
Ordered 2 and they seem pretty good  They arrived in good shape. But just a warning, the text on the screen for messages is blue on a clack background and it is hard to see. There is probably a way to change this but for the uninitiated, this is a detraction from a good product.
I love it.  Thank you, I love it.
100% good
Great phone at good price!!
Phone works great! Took it to TMOBILE and they hooked it right up!

Great phone. Perfect size for those who don't need the large screen. Easy to set up as I used my existing Sim Card. No problems with T=Mobile system.
Very android - after using Samsung tablet, lessons learned were transferrable to phone. Would have preferred clean international version, not AT&T, not T-Mobile or any other carrier's version. Firm believer in buying unlocked phones that are in no way tied to any carrier.
Coming from someone who hasn't had a smart phone before, this phone is perfect.  I don't have large hands or small hands, about medium sized. I was able to use this phone with one hand no problem which was a big plus for me, one of the only reasons why i didn't buy a full sized S3. I have tried many good graphics games and they all run fine but i do lag a little sometimes in contract killer 2. Aside from that, the only real downside that i can think of is that the screen is a little less responsive than my friends i phone 5's and galaxy S3's. (I would never buy an i phone anyways)
Working well on StraightTalk / AT&T  I bought this to run on the AT&T network via StraightTalk.  I bought the StraightTalk BYOP kit from WalMart for $60 which includes a month of the $45/month plan, and had little trouble activating it. (Manually entering APN settings was unexpected, but it worked.)  It gets 4G LTE here in a rural area, about as well as I'd expect (signals are weak around here but they work in most places).  I did have one glitch... the first night after activating it, it upgraded automatically without asking, from Android 4.4.2 to 5.0.2.  When I woke up to find it had upgraded, the battery was 50% drained in 3 hours and it was having trouble connecting to WiFi and 4G.  Uh oh!  I thought I had hit similar Lollipop bugs that rendered my Google Nexus 7 tablet basically unrecoverably useless.  I had success trying a bunch of things, which included: Several reboots. Clearing the cache. Forgetting and reconnecting to WiFi, and switching to the 2.4GHz WiFi instead of the 5GHz I had been using. And, making it not automatically try to connect to WiFi (seems to drain battery).  I did NOT need to do a factory reset.  After all that, the battery life seems fine, and I see no flaws in functionality.  I was hesitant to buy this because I wasn't sure how good the camera would be, and I needed a good camera.  It seems quite good!  Photos of people or outdoor scenery look good, even when copied to a PC where I can see more detail. I was especially impressed how well the flash worked for indoor photos... a previous HTC EVO 4G I had had a rather lousy flash that whited out everything. They seem to be doing something here with the flash to figure out just how much it needs, so I get good color in the flash photo and also about the right brightness.  I think I need to buy a second one of these since this was actually for my wife, and I had an unfortunate screen cracking accident today with my device.
screen never cracked for me and camera was superb!  this phone worked spectacularly for me. I needed an unlocked phone to make it pay as you go. the only reason I replaced it was because I had broke it intentionally, I have a bit of a temper. it lived throughout my whole pregnancy and died one stormy night haha! definitely get a case for your phone if you have a temper. this phone has been in a toilet, in the heat, thrown, tossed, dropped etc. its storage is moderate. I never cracked the screen. this phone probably would have lasted me 5 years!! I am very impressed. the camera was exceptional! my only flaw was the front facing camera had black spots after half a year of age? maybe this was my doing! anyhow great product! Samsung is the best.
Love it!
Great Product  I greatly appreciate this business. Package was received on time with no problems. Everything was described correctly. There was a few scratches but it was nothing that a case couldn't cover up. This is a business that I could recommend to anyone and I definitely wouldn't mind purchasing other items from here as well. Thanks so much Palm Beach Deals! Another happy customer!
This phone surpassess all that I've tried over the years!  I love everything about this phone: speed, screen size, graphics, sound, storage, and layout!
Sweetness  This phone is where its at. Nice and fast, super snappy. The only problem was that the battery life is not great but that was no longer a problem when I got a battery case.
Excelent...

Excellent phone, Excellent seller.  I still have this phone and it's fine, I did not qualify why I did not know I could. I am really grateful to the seller and amazon for the help regarding the price they placed at the time of shipping since I am from venezuela and by that time shipping would cost me much more than the phone but they helped me and I thank you. I am hoping that mature activate our right to dollars new to be able to buy the Samsung s7, I wish, he he. I recommend 100%. Thank you.
better at multitasking than the snapdragon counterpart
so far i am still using this good phone no problem, thanks
Thanks
great phone
Real and it's worth it  More space and it can play the games my old phone cannot. Samsung Galaxy Exhibit upgraded to a Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime Value edition. Yes they don't mention that it's a value edition. I still think it was worth it.
Excellent
good product, like it  Quick shipment, good product, like it.
S3 still rocks !  I love my this marvel! Is like having a powerfull machine in your pocket. The best cellphone out there right now (except for the S4), without doubts !
I love it! It works great....
PERFECTO
Cant go wrong with this phone  This phone is great.
I had a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 absolutely loved it until it turned into a pile of fecal matter. HTC One is spectacular I am using this phone with the Straight talk service and I could not be happier. I have not had any issues with service or with the phone itself. I enjoy using it so much it never leaves my side. It not only performs better than the Note 2 it also is much more aesthetically pleasing.
My fiancee has been wanting one and he loves it.
Don't compare it with iPHONE  Well it will be a shame comparing this monster to the iPhone. Apart from the shape and design (which we may disagree upon) it beats it in every shot. Looking forwards for the upcoming S IV
does it work with a tmobile  does  it work with a tmobile sim
Portable Mac Mini  I waited a long time to get a smartphone.  I first tried the Samsung Galaxy Showcase.  I really liked the Showcase.  It had a big screen with a lot of memory.  The display was great.  When the iPhone went to $75, I wanted to give it a shot so I traded the Showcase for the iPhone.  I was used to the Mac OS since I had been using one for more than 10 years.  It was definitely more simplified for me than the Showcase. The interface is really slick.  I rarely get on my computer at all these days since I got this phone.  My email stays immaculate.  I can bank, pay bills, shop, browse music, skype, listen to podcast, youtube and much more. The GPS was better on the Galaxy in my opinion.  I downloaded the Mapquest app for iPhone and have no complaints now! The swype feature on the android I thought was much better at first.  When I got used to the super smart keyboard on the iPhone, I am typing and texting just as fast, so I will call it a draw.  The camera is really good as well. It takes great pictures to add to my photo albums.  The only problem I have with iPhone is not being able to expand your memory offline. I use Netflix all the time so I can be in the room with my 3 year old so his cartoons don't make me a zombie.  I am really loving the Amazon Cloud Player app for Apple!  It helps, but you don't have to be really smart to use this phone!

Great unlocked iphone  Received phone in excellent condition. Tested it with a couple of Sims to ensure it was unlocked. Took it on a trip to India. It performed perfectly, even able to call home using an Indian SIM card.
Great phone, camera was ok for it's time  Great phone,  camera was ok for it's time, despite what the reviewers said, and got better with updates. My ex-gf uses it now and I miss it. Upgrades to 6.0.2 Marshmallow by the way,  not just 4.4.2. Has been receiving monthly security updates since Android 6.  I know because I'm the one who takes the time to install them :p
excellent phone  Very excellent phone with battery life and performance. Best thing about the phone is it works completely without a single button. I never used a single physical button
It works well.
excellent
No issues whatsoever
100% conforme
Came as promised.
Although I did not keep the phone!!!  Zachary was great the whole time and helped me return his product to him without any hassle. He honestly made the experience great. Based on the emails we exchanged he seems like an honest person and replies promptly.
Happy customer  Arrived on time and looks great just like new!

Just out right an overall wonderful phone with an outstanding battery life haven't had any issues at all and I am bad on a telephone
Samsung GT-i8190 Galaxy S3 Mini  An excellent phone that balances the cost / benefit ratio, good positioning in the market with a target class: B-, C; providing almost all the same benefits as their  rearward Serie  IV, but can not upgrade the operating system.
IT is a great phone for the price.  It works really well and there are no bugs.
Yay, it works!
I bought it for a friend and I'm 100% satisfied , it said the phone had scratches but it came like new didn't have any scratches at all
the best purchases I have made . delighted with this great product and serves perfect in Venezuela
Great Product & Service

Arrived quickly and works well!  I got an iphone quickly and in good condition.  It looks and feels like new and I have had no problems with it yet.
Excelente Phone.
perfect  Should of bought an iphone instead but wateva i could have both now :)
Perfect!  Fantastic phone!  Love the fact that it gets all the Updates immediately, rather than waiting for US carriers!  No bloatware and works perfectly with StraightTalk with AT&T sim (also from StraightTalk).  Blows my brother's SGSIII away :) !!!  I was leery about about 3rd-party seller (my paranoia), even though the sale happens through Amazon, but everything worked out great.
thank you
Perfect.  It is a perfect phone. Everything is perfect.
Best phone ever

Axon Pro is a beast for the Price.  Everything about this phone is as expected, except for the fact that I didn't get The JBL Ear buds. I got cheap Ear pods Knock off with it.  Now to the Review it self: Powerful Snap Dragon 810 Octa-Core Processor, Great Hi-Fi sound, Beautiful Quad HD Display, Decent Call Quality (calls are loud in Clear and people never had a hard time hearing me).  This phone has a lot of bang for your Buck.

Buy it.  Good phone.
Great Experience!  It was a hard choice between this device and the Nexus 6p. I cannot speak to the quality of the 6p and that is not what I am here to do. However, this device is very sturdy and very quick for the price. I had a hard time deciding when looking at the reviews on Amazon for each device. Many people seem to have issues or harbor some hatred for the 5x. I am here to tell you that the device is flawless and the price cannot be beat. Couple this with Project Fi and not only will you have a great phone but great service. That's my takeaway from the phone and I would most definitely recommend it to anyone.
I love the iPod touch  I love the iPod touch. The costumer service was great and very helpful for me. And the iPod was in great condition when it was delivered.

iPhone 3 GS Review  THE hot phone of its day.  Now very reasonably priced and still retains the benefits of a smart phone while not having all the latest bells and whistles.  The battery has good durability and lasts a long time compared to, say, the iphone 4.  I like it so much that we may get yet another to replace the current 3GS when it dies.  I highly recommend Apple's first and smartest phone.
Excellent!
I really like how fast it shipped  I really like how fast it shipped, also the product does work because some peoples don't work but mine did. Overall I really liked this product and its seller I world definitely buy it again, or buy more things from this seller.

On time , product as described
Great Purchase  My dad loves his phone. He keeps raving about it. He loves the features, the size of the phone and the color.
exceptional price - great product - saved some money honey
Great. As brand new
Perfect transition from iPhone  So happy with this. Great pre-sales support from seller to answer my questions on specs etc. Shipped immediately and I got the phone the very next day (paid <$4). The phone itself is awesome for my first android, exactly what I needed. Goodbye iPhone!  Came with Gingerbread installed. Be sure to check your carrier's 3G and cell bands before buying. There are two versions of this phone and one will not work in the U.S. with AT&T etc. This is the one that will.  Will see about the battery life that many have complained about.
Satisfied Customer  Great buy.
I love it!!!!!!!
Fantastic
received, all right, thank you very much, the'll take into account for future purchase

Perfect product, seller recommended. satisfied with the purchase.
Real review of a great phone compared to 5s!  I got my phone through T-mobile's deal of $0 down and pay over 2 years. It's my first iphone switching from andriod. At first I was worried about missing out on the 5s features and that it would be quite small compared to HTC One and other Samsung phones, but I think it is the right size for convenient single hand usage. A bigger screen may be welcome in the future for better movies/gameplay/document viewing but it's certainly better than the 4s screen size.  I finally went to an Apple store to see the 5s that I "missed out" on. I found out I actually preferred the 5c to the 5s because of how comfortable it felt in hand and the slight additional weight of the 5c made it feel more substantial and durable. The 5s was also less comfortable to hold due to the sharp edges and felt "cheap" because of how light it was. I was also kind of turned off by how the 5s looks after being used for so long - the demo models were a bit scratched/grimy not very bright/shinny/attractive. On the other hand the 5c "ages" well. I also tested responsiveness and speed of the user interface and was not impressed. It was exactly the same as the 5c. Probably larger apps and other computation would load faster, but general things like scrolling through menus, opening webpages was no different. Next time I'll have to try something more graphics intensive and report back but it does say a lot about the 5c.  Functionality, speed and ergonomics are all there with the 5c. Another thing worth mentioning is that the 5c is the less "flashy" phone and that was important to me (at least the white version) since I am not looking to standout and since there are a lot of phone theft/muggings/robberies these days. So overall, I feel this phone fit my needs perfectly.
excellent

Nice and sexy...
Good af
REally Works!  I could reommend this item to people all over the world. I'm from Venezuela, and I'm using it right now. It works with almost all 3G companies.
Best Phablet for the price!  Will try to keep it short. This is my first "big" phone or Phablet!! i bought this for only one reason..Battery Life. Was tired of charging my phone almost everyday or sometimes in 6-8 hours. I have used Nexus 4, Samsung S3. This is a great phone. I would love to root it but right now thats not possible but thats ok. The default UI is fine and not too much crap installed on this phone. The display is gorgeous!! really!! 720p seems enough on this phone . That was one concern i had but saw a couple of videos , pics and no worries this phone has a beautiful display! Battery life is amazing . i get 2 days easily with heavy usage and 3-4 days with light use. Camera is good but i think could be better esp the rear camera. The front camera is good. I get 4G speeds on T-Mobile anywehere between 15-30mbps download and 9-15mbps upload . TMobile is still upgrading its speed so once it upgrades here i am sure i will get higher speeds as reported by other members (somewhere in the range of 80-90mbps). I haven't seen any lag in any apps (Games also) till now. It has admirably handled everything though the maximum i have played is Riptide 2 and Asphalt 8. I installed Nova to get app drawer but i seem to like their default UI also. I hope the support for SD card doesnt go away with Kitkat upgrade or they have a manager to allow access to SD card for apps. The only issue is the location of the power button. it shouldnt have been on the same side as the volume keys but thats as far as the cons go!!! This phone is not that large that it becomes a discomfort in your pockets. One of the best phones and its cheap for what it does!!the other phablets like Note2/3/4 might have a higher res, faster processor etc but in the end this is perfect for my needs! Update 08/01/2014: having this for around 2 weeks, the battery life lasts easily upwards of 3-4 days. I use easily 3-5 GB per month so i am not a light user but this phone has exceeded my expectations. Hopefully we can get Kitkat on this phone soon.
Best phone I ever bought
Satisfied  Had to change out the camera exterior lense because it was too scratched to take a picture and the pic be of quality. It cost me $10 to replace it. Everything else was great.
The better choice  If you are the type of person that always wants to have the newest gadget: stop reading here. For all the others that want to have a great phone at a great price: the iPhone 4S is your first choice. It offers a lot more than the 4 and not a lot less than the 5. Believe me: this is a great deal.
juanjosegavidia_13@hotmail.com  perfecto la entrega del envi con todos sus accesorios en perfecto estado desbloqueados estoy muy feliz con el producto lo recomiendo.
Excellent phone, Worth the Money!  Bought 2018 for an existing ATT Plan.  Love this phone! This has been by far one of the most durable phones I have ever owned. When I busted the screen on my old one (went screen down on the edge of concrete), I replaced it with this phone. This phone still works great, has a lot of updates to do when you first get it, so plan to have a day or two of updating the software and firmware (all through ATT push services, but these can leave the phone inactive for a few hours at a time).  Phone worked as soon as I stuck my ATT sim in, no need for calling or stopping into the ATT store. This phone works well with my Bluetooth devices (smartwatch, headphones, car radio). Only downside is with less RAM, that it can get bogged down with having too many apps running.  Camera works well, it has an option for High Definition Resolution with the rear facing camera that is very detailed and crisp. The front facing camera is lacking a bit, but works. Only has the beauty face for the selfie camera, no panoramic shots for the front facing.  Unfortunately with the age of the phone there are not many brand name cases (such as otterbox out there). But lots of after market ones that work great and will make this phone almost indestructible. I would suggest a case with both a hard and soft component to the shell, and one that has a raised edge that extends above the phone, so that if you drop it on tile it doesn't shatter your screen.
My new phone  Phone came as advertised in original sealed box with every accessory intact. Ordered the 32gb USA model and  I am so loving the speed of the phone, the 2gb ram makes multitasking so sweet without lags, the phone also boots very fast. Making my Galaxy nexus feel like a pentium 1 computer lol. Also got the maxboost hard case which fits it well and anker screen protectors.
I had this phone be4 n love it.  I had this phone be4 n love it..now those pics so liquid all over box n phone....i swear ppl r dum... any kind of batteries will not do that..that is clearly water .....batteries would of blew up or had ashes all over the phone ... N this only pics i seen 3 of them ....nobody esle had this promble mmmmmm how weird
the Nokia phone that you sold me does not work ...  good attention , in spite that at first I was unhappy that the product ( phone) did not turn on , you knew assist me and lend adequate support to solve the problem . With a new battery. Because that was the fault he was presenting. Currently the phone is wonderful works great thank you very much .
I bought this one month ago and it works great!! So far.
One gorgeous phone!  Love it.  I had to return this as it didn't come with everything that was shown in the picture. (Amazon service was A+ as always).  I purchased the same phone elsewhere and just love it.  It's a beautiful phone and a breeze to use.  I think I prefer the Google voice app over the S app, but both are good and come with the phone. (Admittedly the Siri voice is better sounding.) LOL.  This is a high end, beautiful luxury phone.  Expensive , but that shouldn't be a surprise.  I am truly enjoying my phone and have had many people ask about it.  Over and over I hear "Gorgeous phone!". "Just beautiful".  Oh yeah....I've already dropped it three times.  Not a mark on it and no cracked glass!!!! Right now my lovely phone is going commando.  It's been two weeks and not a mark on it.  The fast charger is so great.  You can't believe how fast it works.  Love, love, love my phone.
The Best Phone  Thank you very much, finally the phone is in my hands, was send it to Venezuela and now i am very happy, because the phone works perfectly in my country

No Complaints  Phone is awesome.. no complaints..
Im actually really upset....  I recently ordered a phone,case an screen protector the case broke inless then amonth an I had to order a new battery bc battery wouldn't hold a charge.. I be tryed to contact yall an no one is getting back to me I think that's really bad customer service. smh never again
Fantastic phone! I love it!  I upgraded my phone from a samsung galaxy s2 so this phone is a major improvement. I use T mobile in New york City and have so far found no connection issues. Service has been fine and I have easily been able to call and text people in NY and in Pennsylvania.  Pros: Lightning fast, super fast charging, super loud + clear speakers, great audio through headphones --- can clearly hear any conversation way clearer then on my old phone, runs a 128gb sd card without a hiccup, extremely smoothly. Easily updated to android 7.0. Fingerprint scanner works great. I use both my index fingers and it is eaisly able to read them 8 out of 10 times without messing up.  Cons: Not exactly stock android ( but contains minimal bloatware --- idk why people have complained. my galaxy had waaaaay more bloatware), speaker is really loud --- after 1 week i am still tweaking the levels of different ringtones/call volumes so that i don't blow out my ears.  I had to buy an additional $25 nano sim card from t mobile to get my phone working. Budget for that if you only have a regular sim card.  I also disagree with other reviews about the home buttons. I found that the home button and back/forward button placement is not too close togeth and is a good position in respect to the phone Pretty much no other con -- I love this phone!
Great
Best Phone I've Had  Phone arrived much sooner than expected, which made me a happy camper! I love this phone. All I had to do was insert my SIM card and my SD card and pop the battery in and away I was! This is the best phone I've had yet.
This is a great phone. The camera is outstanding  This is a great phone. The camera is outstanding! I am still learning about all the features and controls. I was going to buy the S3 but when comparing it to the S4 it became a no-brainer. This ph will do about a thousand times more than my first computer, seriously. I can't see where I would ever need more than this one. I am using Straight Talk with AT&T. Works great.
Good
I love this phone  I upgraded from the Nexus 6 with no regrets. I love this phone!
Very happy with the item came as described, ship on time
Great phone - Using Cricket Network  Phones was in perfect condition. Works great on Cricket Network. No issues at all, love the phone.
Good phone  It is as good as they announced. We got it from the French operator ORANGE, so after a week developed a weird freez problem in calls, but it solved a week later after an actulization.
I was using an LG G4 for the past five months when an opportunity came up to buy an unlocked Galaxy S6 at a discounted price.  The G4 is a fine phone with many nice features but the size and overall feel of the phone just didn't feel right in my hand.  I also missed the excellent display of Samsung's amoled screen which I had with the S4.  The G4 also has poor battery life and found myself charging the phone twice a day.  There is also a major software flaw affecting the touchscreen.  Sometimes the screen would miss my taps and I became very frustrated while using the keyboard or playing some games.  The Galaxy S6 is the perfect size at 5.1 inches which allows me to handle it with one hand.  Battery life is more than enough for a day's use.  The phone has a solid and premium feel.  But you do need a cover because it's slippery.  There are a few things I don't like about the S6.  One of them is the physical button in the front.  I prefer the G4 button set up in the back of the phone.  I miss the G4 tap feature to wake the phone up.  I also prefer the flat look of the icons in the G4 compared to the cartoonish ones in the S6.  Other than that the S6 is one powerful phone and it doesn't miss a beat when you're scrolling or changing from one app to another.  I highly recommend this smartphone.  I wouldn't worry about not having an sd card slot or removable battery.  I had that with the G4 but I'm managing just fine with 32gb in the S6.  Backup your photos on flickr or google and you're set.
Nice  This phone is the best... Has no problems
Good buy, very user friendly  Very user friendly, battery life is great and display is sufficient for the cost
Quality for the price....  Okay, so I've written a bunch of phone reviews here on Amazon and some of those I bought off ebay.  I'm a big fan of Amazon (and I buy a lot of products off Amazon) and the reviews that you can read but I will always follow the price.  I bought this phone for my wife off ebay for $179 new.  We use it on Straight Talk and one thing I love about this phone and my J7 is that it has preset APN settings that will automatically link and within seconds you have LTE after you install your SIM card.  GSM carriers only, they will not work on CDMA networks.  I own a J7 2015 and this is exactly the same with exception to the screen size and the processing speed.  It has 1.5gigs of RAM 16gigs on ROM both running on Android Marshmallow (updated from lollipop), the batteries are different but in the grand scheme of things the smaller screen size will equal out to the small battery size and they should have ruffly the same battery life, plus the powersaving mode is a great way to extend the life.  Otherwise I love the Marshmallow OS on top of touchwize, it's smooth fast and with 1.5gigs is perfect for everyday usage.  We are not gamers (I game a little, my wife none) so the more processing speed and RAM are really not needed.  Also dual SIM (which most in the US wouldn't use) and separate micro SD card slot which for me is a must.  The look and feel of the phone is good.  It's plastic, all around.  But, the thing is most of the time we put a phone in a case or cover so what's the point in having a phone that is metallic?  As for us we buy a TPU cover and a tempered screen glass, that for me has been a life saver, or should I say screen saver:)  Those things are all I need to protect the phone from every day use and the occasional drop or fall. With the plasticness aside it is a nice looking phone.  My wifes old phone is an S4 that I bought used.  They look very similar with the J5 being a hair longer on the screen size and the S4 a hair wider but both are 5.0 screens.  It really is a good looking phone especially compared to the S4 which was also plastic based.  I bought the white version and it in my opinion looks better that the white version of the S4.  One of the best parts about the J5 an J7 are the AMOLED screens.  I went from a S5 to a J7 and my wife a S4 to the J5.  Now, compare the S4 and S5's 400+ ppi AMOLED screens the 260+ ppi AMOLED on the J5 and J7 and honestly you can't tell that much of a difference, unless you have both phones side by side pointing out all the details.  The J5 screen color looks really crisp and clear and compared to a regular LCD screen of say a BLU Energy X Plus (that I own and use as a game phone at home) it is a great screen picture for the money you pay.  Overall just like my J7 review, the J5 for the money has hands down some of the best specs and functionality in a phone.  The S4 had features and stuff that my wife never used.  If you want a basic phone that has great functional usability these low end Samsung phones are for you.  Plus they are probably a little better than some of the low end phones that you get from your carrier.  Samsung sells these phones online only and if you're like me and like prepaid plans like Straight Talk and buying your phones outright these are the best cheapest phones that have all you need in it to be a quality smartphone.  I've owned several BLU phones, used flagship Samsung phones and now I found the best of something quality for a cheap price.  Plus when I bought the J7 it was on lollipop and updated to marshmallow.  Now I'm not sure if it will get any more updates beyond that but Samsung does update the firmware on these phones were BLU never or rarely did.  Also, my opinion is that flagship phones and smartphones in general are getting saturated with specs.  They try to climb the highest number in RAM, in ROM in screen ppi, the newest features, etc that for the most part unless your really want it don't really need.  Two year old flagship, or even three year old flagship phones have all your need and want and you can buy those used cheap and be just as happy.  What sets Samsung apart is these lower end phones with great specs at a great price and you can buy them new unlocked and ready to go.  Overall a great purchase for GSM prepaid users like me.  I've owned and written reviews here on Amazon for the Samsung SIII mini, S4 (red), S5 (black), J7 (2015 white) BLU Life S, Studio Mini LTE, Studio 5.0 LTE, Life 8, and Energy X Plus.  I like phones, I like cheap and I like quality.  These J series phones that Samsung puts out in my opinion are the best bang for your buck with quality specs and practical for everyday use.  They do so well that they keep coming out with new models like the J3, J5 or J7 2016 versions.  I've looked at the A series but some of those won't work in the US on LTE.  If you want the latest flagship it comes at a price or you have to wait for it to get old and buy cheap used.  If you want new with quality specs the J5 is the phone for you.
This phone is awesome!  It is so easy to use. Great reception.
Hi, let me know you that it is a gread phone, I had Samsung for the last 3 years, but I think that Samsung sell phone (not other article) by the commercial. I will not tell you about the specifications but this phone is more than I expected, and the battery lasts more than the samsung.
Great phone, very fast very smooth

Works just fine in Belize  Factory quality. Works just fine in Belize. Compatible with all the networks here.
Love this device!  I love this phone.  It is perfect for me and what I require from my smart phone.  Which is not extraordinary but more than basic.  It's great having the newest updates and not having bloated really.  The screen is beautiful.... These are the blackest blacks I've ever seen on a phone.  My camera is great though sometimes a little distorted at the bottom of a picture.  The speed is impeccable.
Great phone got exactly what i payed for and everything was in legit.
Good value  This was a replacement phone for my teenager. It's perfect and arrived during Prime 2-day window.
I love it!!!  Totally happy with my Nexus 5X. It's fast and powerful, good battery life and light weight.
This phone has worked great.  I've had no issues and really like it now that I've gotten accustom to the form factor.
Works flawlessly and this coming from an iPhone convert.

Perfect for normal person!

Awesome Phone!!  This is an upgraded version of Lumia 520.  There is not quite much of a difference between these two models 520 and 635.  This 635 has a larger screen than 520.  Performance is great in terms of camera, wi-fi, touchscreen sensitivity, battery back up, etc.  I highly recommend this product.

pretty good
Dual SIM a great bonus!  The Axon 7 Smartphone by ZTE is a beautiful phone.  Very classy.  (There are lots of reviews and product descriptions that list the specifications, so I won't repeat them here. )  It feels good in my hand (just a bit slippery), display is bright/sharp, sound is outstanding (probably the best feature), battery life is very good, and speed is the fastest phone I have used by far. (My other Android phone experience was dulled by a much slower processor.)  One of the best features for me is the dual SIM.  Although you will use one of them if you want to expand the memory up to 256 GB with a microSD card .  With 64GB of RAM, I won't be needing a memory card for a while.  Being able to have T-Mobile and ATT (both MNVO's), in the same phone is an easy choice for me, since I sometimes have spotty service in our rural environment. The Axon 7 has that covered.  I find the camera to be very good.  Some reviews have not been so keen on the low light performance.  For my use, it's great.  I had no problems with service with either MNVO.  I use the ATT network more often.  Having both (ATT & T-Mobile) available without carrying two phones is a great perk!  I'm not a real techy person, but the specs seem to be really good compared to other phones in this group (says my husband). Factor in that the Axon 7 is less expensive than most others in this category, it's a winner for me!
Good product, excellent seller
Great phone that I would buy again  Overall the phone is perfect for what I needed. I looked at everything locally from the  Samsung Galaxy Core Prime to the iPhone 6s. This is my first smart phone and data plan.  I upgraded from a 6 year old Motorola Quantico flip phone.  I couldn't find what I wanted and I checked with my provider for compatibility and decided to order the GSM, Samsung J5, factory unlocked, international version because it had the features I wanted.  SHIPPING: While browsing the website I found there were shipping restrictions on new cell phones due to the batteries. Amazon wouldnt ship outside the continental 48 states (Amazon wouldnt ship via air) so I had the phone shipped to a location I was going to visit in Washington State.  I got a sim card from my local cell phone provider (not a large national company) before I left home and when the phone arrived I was there to receive it.  BlutekUSA was the seller and Amazon fulfilled the order.  I ordered it on 12/31/15.  It arrived 3 days earlier than the estimate via UPS Ground from Virginia and was 7 days in transit.  SETUP/USE: It was new in a factory sealed box and after setting the language from Hindi to English, installing the sim card and setting the APN (access point name) everything worked as it should in Seattle and later back home in Alaska.  The APN setting can happen automatically but it didn't for me.  I don't expect to be a heavy user but I tested most of the features.  The processor is fast enough for running the available apps and the phone has a high resolution screen for photos, video and web browsing.  With a fast cellular or Wi-Fi connection Netflix loaded really fast and ran in great looking HD.  The front camera pictures are very good, 13 MP, and the internal storage, 8 GB, is sufficient for me.  I added a 32 GB SD card but it can accept up to a 128 GB micro SD.  I recommend looking at videos and the quick start or online manual so you know what you're getting and where to install the sim or sims (it will accept 2 sim cards for 2 phone lines) and micro SD memory inside the back cover of the phone.
Great Phone and camera  I love this phone. I have one so I bought my wife one just like it. My only complaint is the sound is not very loud in the headphones. Not sure if there is an adjustment for that or not. It seems to be louder by bluetooth, so that is the workaround.
big screen  i like the big screen, maybe i'am a crazy guy
Worth the money  Love this phone.  It is a little bigger than the average phone, but that allows the keys on the virtual keyboard to be spaced a little further apart and to put the letters and numbers on the screen together.  I can't tell you how much easier to use that is. I have really come to love the pen.  The phone software adds many functions like the ability to write on the screen, select an image or part of a page.  Once you get used to it you use it all the time. Also, I find that the best supporting apps are written for the Galaxy and the iPhones.  The advantage really adds up.  They cost more but they'really worth the extra bucks. Many people start with a cheap phone then trade up.  Nobody goes the other way.
I enjoy this phone very much  I enjoy this phone very much. I purchased it to function as my everyday computer, and with the bluetooth keyboard and mouse I purchased for it, it will do great as just that. It is compatible with OTG and MHL. I have large hands, and so holding it isn't a problem, although, of course, with such a large phone, reaching the top of the screen with your thumb is never easy. I'm purchasing an iRing knockoff (and securing it with the built in anchor point as a fail-safe) in order to make it easier to hold, support the phone as a stand, and also give me a place to put a carabiner to clip it onto my jeans. That is my only real complaint, that it is so hard to find a case that you can be sure will work for it, and even if you do, the case is just hanging around empty while you use your phone; my three-in-one solution then was an iRing and a carabiner. An extra complaint for AT&T though related to this phone is that you will not be able to easily update it to 4.4.2 unless you have an AT&T sim card. The only way to do it otherwise is to use a program called Odin to manually install the update: http://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-mega/general/stock-odin-firmware-i527-4-4-2-t2835136 (this will erase all of your data). To get the phone into download mode it is volume down (not up) + power + home all at the same time.  I purchased this product used but the only problems were that the screen has damage so that a dark purple spot appears in the lower left corner of the screen rather than black and the case is slightly bent at the top. I do have to say though that the carrying case sent with it in no way fits the phone; it does, however, fit the pico projector that I purchased to go with the phone.
very good
This phone changed my life  I'm not sure if this is correlation or causation, but after purchasing this phone my income tripled and I met my dream girl.  Phone has never froze on me.  I recommend rooting and flashing the G3 cloudy rom from xda developers.  I have had zero reliability issues and the best battery life of any phone I've had (20ish) since they were candybars.  I talk on phone 4-5 hours a day, often bluetooth, and use Google drive constantly.  I have 7 or so numbers routed to my phone and trust this for really doing business.  I use the ballistic case because the spigen was tough to find for the g2. It is available for the g3 which costs the same on amazon now as this dude when i bought it.  I also use tempered glass screen cover.  Highly recommend.
Just loving this phone  I just love this phone, it is definitely what I wanted, Came open but it is working, This phone answer every need you may have. It is the best

muy buen producto.
Note 3 - excellent buy  It is exactly what I need for my work. It is most of the time replacing my laptop (that I have not to carry with me in most of the cases when I'm out the office ) - I have all my applications and the data (in the cloud) with me and can be reachable 24/7
very good
Best phone ever.
excellent
My son has one of these AMAZING phones. Usualy an upgrade is, not all we hope for. This devise, blows the S4,5 out of the water.  AMAZING !!!
Excellent product! Samsung is the best  Really enjoy the product is not heavy, both camaras works great and is very easy to navigate, the screen is sensitive enough for my taste and the size of the phone is also very good not too big not to small
awesome!
It has been an amazing experience. A very competitive price and quick delivery  It has been an amazing experience. A very competitive price and quick delivery. Received it without any damage. Nexus 5 is probably one of the best phone you can use. Its got great features and I love it more than any other Android or iPhone. Good processor with amazing RAM capabilities. Games are smooth, Camera is awesome, people say that its not sufficient, but trust me its more than sufficient for normal user. If you are photography enthusiast then probably taking pics with a phone is foolish. But it captures the moments perfectly. All in all Google Nexus 5 rules and Seller is trustworthy.
Perfect!
Good phone for the $$$

Great phone for a Great price.  For the price, this is an excellent entry level iOS phone. Its interesting that this phone is cheaper than a new iPod touch.  Sister dropped her 4s in the toilet, this was a great replacement to that.

The best cel i ever got!  I luv this cel! Even though people think the screen is big, the colors are awesome and i think is way much better than iphone! And it arrived so fast!!

Good deal
I give the phone a five because it is big and pretty but they sent me a used phone when i ordered a new one it only lasted a year, I would love to have a new one.
Very good
A quality phone worth looking at  I got lucky with this.  I originally bought a Moto G4+, which was a lemon -- it had what I found out was not an uncommon problem of repeatedly and spontaneously rebooting.  I returned the Moto and found the Axon 7 after some more research.  After several weeks now, the phone continues to work flawlessly.  Unlike professional reviewers, I have not tried a large variety of available phones.  But, to me, the Axon 7 is fast and has an excellent display, sound, photos, and videos.  It is thoughtfully designed and appears to be very well made.  I can't think of anything that another phone could provide that would be better than this.  It is worth doing some research to see what professional reviewers say about this phone to determine whether it has all of the features you want.  If it will do all that you want and you want all that it will do, I don't think that this phone can be beat for the price.
nice
Just what I wanted! It matched the description perfectly and arrived promptly.

Perfet,  tank you. ....

Great deal!  I just received iPhone 5c today and it was more than I expected! I'm so happy with it! Considering its a used phone and there's barely a mark on it! I was nervous because the price was great and it was already a used phone.... I didn't know what I would get! But The phone was everything the seller said it would and I'm a happy customer! Thanks to the seller for being real!!!

Fabulous phone  I really love it. This is my first real smart phone.  I did have too tweak it a bit. But that was my choice. The seller told me what he was selling it came as promised in the great condition promised. It works fabulously.  It being a Verizon phone I was able to "tweak" it and make it work with straight talk. I highly suggest this phone.
Love this phone and its a great mini tablet....love it

Voice quality is also excellent for calls - that's what I bought it for  Can confirm it has VoLte on TMobile.  Tested VoLte by installing Lte Discovery and making a call. A phone without VoLte will switch to hspa+ and not stay on Lte. This phone stayed on Lte. Tested band 12 by going to a location my phone switches to band 12 and checking Lte Discovery. Says Band 12, and has same signal strength as my previous phone that also had band 12. Also saw it switch to band 4 when I walked upstair, then switch back and the dbm changed significantly.  Voice quality is also excellent for calls - that's what I bought it for. The most natural and human sounding of any phone I've used so far. Way better imo than the m9 which was my last phone.
I like very  Yes, I like very Hedda
Excellent phone from the seller  Excellent phone from the seller. I'm very satisfied and enjoying my phone! Props to the seller for sending me right away and adapter for this international phone!

Working perfectly!  So far so great! The phone arrived in what looked to be brand new condition, not one scratch or scrape anywhere on the screen or phone itself.
You know you want one...  Beautiful phone, comes with a headset, even though the box doesn't mention it.  Fast delivery from Amazon and I was up and running in minutes after I took it out of the box. You do need a nano SIM if you don't have one already.
Awesome
Works great.
Great phone  The phone itself is excellent. It's sleek and very responsive. I've messed with other android phones in the past and it always felt like there was a slight lag whenever I pressed a button or if I was using the touchscreen. The Galaxy S2 doesn't have any of those issues. The phone is easy to navigate, has good battery life, and I'm happy with it overall.  The only downside is that it will not work with T-mobile 4G in the US.
good phone
LG G5 Geat Phone  Amazing phone there are so many functions on this device; I'm still finding new things it can do. It it's very fast, and the ease of use makes it a synch to convert to. The finger print reader works wonderfully, and camera is amazing. I've saw some reviews reporting some problems with their devices, but I haven't experienced any. Would definitely recommend; and buy again.
Love It!!!!
Had the phone for a month now and it's been great. Got this to replace the Nexus 5 I was having signal and battery issues. Battery - last me the entire day and is still over 50% after work with moderate use. The battery saver app axon has is neat. You can setup hours of the day when you want the phone on voice and text only to preserve battery. I have mine setup from 10pm - 6am and only uses 1% of battery throughout that time. Signal - both wifi and cell signal is alot better the Nexus 5. I have signal now where in places I don't with Nexus. OS - Axon didn't do much with modifing Android so transitioning from a stock Nexus wasn't to bad. Plus you have the option to use the stock skin. Built - it's a well built device doesn't feel cheap at all. Camera - probably the only real complaint I have with this phone is the focusing on both photo and video doesn't respond as quick as the Nexus. Finger print scanner - for some reason it takes me twice for it to read. But it can be my finger, being a mechanic I always have some dirt/grease on my fingers. But then again the Nexus didn't have that issue. It's up to date running at 7.1.1. had 3 updates once I got the phone.
but I didn't know  Love the phone..only wish I had realized I have no way to add memory. Bit other then that I'm very pleased with the phone and happy with my experience with Amazon.
Very nice phone I've not had any trouble with it at all. Very satisfied.
which I wasn't expecting but completely happy with! The phone looks better than I expected  The phone arrived extremely fast in just 2 business days, which I wasn't expecting but completely happy with! The phone looks better than I expected, almost new. It runs great. It arrived with everything the seller said it would in the listing. This was a great buy. I am extremely happy.

I can only speak for myself, but...  product came in a week and was everything I anticipated it to be. description is perfect! I bought it used and it has zero scratches. what a deal :)
I absolutely love it! So happy to get rid of my android!
Best Buy with low price and good  quality.
Excellent!
I absolutely love my Nexus 6P by Huawei. It's always fast. Always reliable - my entire flawless communication system!
Truly a Life Companion  It does what it's been advertised to do, but it feels even greater!  Came with Chinese locale by default, but pretty easy to switch to English. Coming from the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, I have nothing but high ratings from this purchase. Battery life, processing power, memory; pretty much everything is more than twice as good from what I'm used to with my previous phone. I highly recommend it to anyone thinking of purchasing; most definitely worth the 600+ bucks.
Happy  Great phone. No problem setting it up.
great device..
son loved it
Phone Success   After Reading So Many Reviews From The Good To The Bad Ones & Researching About This Device I Took The Chance & Bought It. & I Must Say I Made A Good Decision. I Was Afraid To Buy A Phone From Amazon Since I Never Purchased One On Here Before. The Only Bad Thing Is I Wish That I Knew What Type Of Sim Card It Held Because I Cant Use It Until I Purchase One.  Camera Is Good. Emojis Bright & Colorful. Easy To Use. Nice Size Phone. Came In Box With Charger, Headphones. I Ordered This On The 3rd & Got It On The 6th In EXCELLENT CONDITION . Everything Works Great . No Complaints.

S7 to date blows away all my other phones.
Huge Improvement Over Galaxy S5 - Galaxy S7 is Rocking All Over Except Screen edge roundness.  Finally I Love My Samsung Again! Only thing that i don't liked on this device is screen edges which is biggest issue while using screen protector on it. screen edge all over is curved even at viewing display too. most of people use glass protection or screen guard now a days. this protection too small compared to actual screen and its bother lot. hope next phone samsung do not follow iphone 6 copy. Good things: Super Fast Phone All Over Experience. I can say, i am now driving BMW from Kia!, Super Fast finger print security is plus! Camera is great even in low light. Battery Life Improved. Now I am using this phone a full day. in S5 i was charging twice a day.  This Review from Phone Dealer Who Locally Buy and Sale Phones in New Jersey. Thanks for looking. No One paying me to write this on here. I am proud owner of S7 from last week!
Great phone I bought three of them works great . Thanks.

nice phone  This is a very nice phone! I love it a lot! It takes clear photos and the wide screen is suitable for both good looking and using. It is convenient to hold the phone. And it also has some very humanized program for people to use.
Order iPhone 5c 16GB everything can as stated good purchase will recommend seller
Best phone. If you are debating between the plus and note 5 pick the edgeplus. For some reason the screen just looks better on the plus than the note 5. Super fast and no lag and the gold looks amazing.
Pleasant Experience! Happy Customer!  I love my new Iphone 5c! It's awesome! I wish I was an Iphone user a long time ago. I love the size and the camera is totally amazing. Based on the description, they said there was going to be wear and tear, but I hardly notice any. It looks pretty brand new. When I first received the package, I took the phone to the Verizon Wireless store to activate it. Unfortunately, the salesman said that the phone was not compatible with their carrier. I was really disappointed, but I tried to remain hopeful. I contacted the company I purchased the phone from and Kenny took care of the problem. He was very helpful and made sure to send me the new VZW Iphone as soon as I sent him the tracking number for the other phone. I received it pretty quickly too. It was a pleasant experience and service. I will definitely recommend this phone to friends and family!
works great love it!
So far so good.
YES :)  Amazing !~ had no issue when I got it brand new and sealed and came with everything Im really happy :)
Everything ok!!
Best phone you can buy  My wife bought the LG G2 at the same time I bought the Nexus 5. Clearly both phones are really impresive. But right now she's really upset with the LG G2, and she want to have a Nexus 5. I'm really glad to make the decision of buying the Nexus. Amazing display, fast as hell, good looking, and the Android 4.4.2 give a plus on usability and friendlyness. Battery isn't the best feature but is quite good.

Really great phone. I activated it with tracfones bring your own phone plan very easily. The guidebook does not say how to insert the sd card, but it can be inserted on top of the right sided SIM slot. There are two sim slots so you can have 2 different phone numbers if you like. I don't plan to, but it's a neat option.
I love it.  It came in almost a week before hand and it was brand new unlocked so i can activate it immediately wish it came with headphones

The best in its range !!!  When you make a review its important to consider what you are getting at the price you have paid. I can't understand why people make fuss about the things that are not paid for. This phone is brilliant at this price. You simply cannot ask for more. And now with the Lollipop update, you've already got way more  One suggestion - Try lowering the top of the phone by a few cms in a way to ensure the top of the phone hits the center of your ear while talking. The sound was perfectly ok to hear in that position.

Great device, but AT&T's support for unlocked devices is crap  Great device. Functions completely as advertised. Won't bother restating the many reviews online. One thing to watch for is that in the USA AT&T's support for unlocked devices seems to be crap. If you have any issue connecting your device to AT&T and they can't fix it in 5 minutes, they won't do anything else to help you. That said, the device did connect to AT&T and to T-Mobile. LTE speeds on T-Mobile were about 3 times faster than on AT&T. Switching to T-Mobile for the speed, better plans, and better support for unlocked devices.
Best Nexus phone ever.  The Nexus 6P was the best balance of price and performance ever to have come from Google's Nexus program. It's still rocking in 2018, though it just stopped getting major updates. (Time to think about flashing a custom ROM.)  Too bad that Google abandoned the Nexus program in favor of the high-priced Pixel program. If I wanted an overpriced flagship phone, I'd get the latest from Samsung. The Nexus program, while it lived, provided midrange hardware at budget prices... with the unlockable bootloader necessary for serious development or customization.
All that a T-Mobile customer can need  I am a T-Mobile customer who will never have another phone contract. Yes, this means paying for a phone full price but that doesn't mean you have to spend unreasonable amounts cash to get a great device. I recently upgraded to this phone. I was using a Moto G ($179) before this Ascend Mate 2. The Moto G is a great phone that can take decent pics, adequate video, and is quite smooth in it's operation. My wife's phone kicked the bucket so I gave her the Moto G and this is where the Mate2 came in.  After having only 3G for the Moto G I learned I wanted the 4G capability for the occasional video streaming. This thing delivers wonderfully. Not only that but the screen is wonderful. One may think that a 6.1" screen @ 720P you won't get a great picture. That person would be wrong. The screen and fluid performance of the phone is beautiful. I'm not concerned about rooting the phone. Sure the phone is large and may look awkward held next to my head. For me I don't talk on the phone much and when I do I use a Bluetooth headset or my system in my car. So, that issue not much of a concern. Also, with the large screen real estate I find that I can use this phone in place of my Nexus 7. When I'm not home and I do have my phone with me I don't miss out on any of the conveniences of my Nexus 7. Truly, this is a great tablet replacement (for me).  Some have complained of the default launcher's use of home screens and icons remaining on the screen rather than having the typical App Drawer. The easiest solution is to load another launcher. By adding my Nova Launcher I've alleviated that problem and have more options for home screen arrangements and organization. Not only that I love how fluid this phone operates. I've added many apps and have had no issues.  The battery is great. I went two days off of one charge and still had power to spare. I tested it by streaming YouTube videos, browsing the web, used e-mail, and kept the screen running for hours each day. I'm not a heavy phone user who plays a lot of games but I did try to keep the phone in use in an effort to see how well it held up. Needless to say this thing has an outstanding battery.  I can't come up with any negatives for this phone. My wife is already wanting one. For now her Moto G is working great so we will save the money. However, if the need arises I will not hesitate to spend the $299 for another Mate2. I hope that the device lasts and doesn't have some hardware fault that renders it useless. Otherwise this may be my phone for the next 3 years. I can't see why I'd need anything else. This phone is great and I highly recommend it.
Good Samsung Phone.  It was a good purchase. The phone came in good condition and it's as good as most of the Samsung Galaxy J phones. The shipping wasn't very fast, but I am happy after all.
Best phone n service  Awesome phone trimed my sim n using it with t mobile android works perfectly no freezing and comes with us charger.

Very Satisfied Customer.  The phones were purchased to be sent to Barbados. Every thing went well  with no problems .Will recommend them to anyone.
Nothing was broken  Just absolutely perfect 
Such a great phone. I think the size of the phone is just perfect. The Nexus 6 is too big. At least with the five, I can reach the entire touch screen with my one hand. 10/10 would buy again.
Real nice  My dad was looking for an iPhone alternative since he was getting bored and missed his previous experience with android.  Found him the N5 and he loves it.  I almost didn't give it to him, I like how it feels and looks.
daughter loves it
the product and the delivery terms were agreed  The product was chosen for its low price compared to the rest of the deals the same or similar products
love it  really cool and awesome. its just like this big huge s3 but my mom love it because of its neatness and she doesn't really like the big phones
Item arrived in good time and works perfectlt
Great phone  Purchased this phone as I do not buy from the carriers since they set them up and lock out lots of features. I refuse to fall to their communist ways. I wanted a fully functional phone and OS. This one serves that purpose and has worked great so far. I have had the phone for quiet some time now and it does exactly what it should do and very well. The S5 is a very nice and capable phone. This is the real deal.

Satisfied with this phone :)  Love this phone. I've had it for a month plus now and it's fast and no lag whatsoever. The phone came brand new and everything was legit. I'd advise you to get the 64gb though. The 32 is good but I feel that the high GB would be better. Camera is super sharp. Videos are clear.
Galaxy S4  Excellent product. Best software everr. Could have a better housing but worth it. And it smudges to easily. So buy a case & screen protector ASAP.
Excellent product arrived in time  Excellent product arrived in time indicated
Love this phone!  Bought this to replace an old bb torch. A bit of a learning curve as it's so different from a blackberry, but now I don't know why I went so long before jumping to an android phone.  The phone was exactly as described and works on my network (bell).
Very easy return when we changed our minds and wanted to send it back.  Oddly, this expensive item was dropped on our doorstep in a little box with no signature required.
... expected & as advertised and the item is working good.  Items reached as expected & as advertised and the item is working good.
lo mejor  trabajando al mximo me encanta
Legit Product that is Super Sleek!  I love LG phones and was devastated when my LG G2 broke. So glad to find LG Flex 2 here for an affordable price. Phone is very sleek and easy to use. Very texter friendly because of the curve. Quick shipping, and legit product with seal on box from AT&T.  Thank you!
Looks and works great and merchant seems to value my dollar and care about my purchase
Excellent!!

Great  After reading lots of reviews about this phone I decided to buy it for my wife for Chritmas. She absolutely loves it. We live in Trinidad and Tobago so I was worried about whether it would work here. It has worked perfectly so far.
Like the Length!
HTC  Gift for a love one, but she loves it.
Amazon .com have become my one stop for shopping
Very satisfied  Great product. Arrived in time. Phone was locked and asked for unlock code. I contacted seller and they responded in an hour. Got the code and phone got unlocked successfully.
excelete gracias
Geat phone  Great product it works perfect everything I expected and more. Would buy any product from this sell I love the phone!
Excellent.

Huge phone!  I love this phone. it's awsome, battery does last a lot, and the front camera works great. It comes unlocked. The only thing is I still haven't gotten used to the size but that's not a problem if you don't live in Venezuela. //  Viene desbloqueado y funciona en Venezuela hasta 4G con Movistar. Es bastante grande.
Bien.

Good phone no major problems yet  The on & off button in the back is in a clumsy position, but I will work with it. Good phone no major problems yet.

Great phone.
Works perfect in Ecuador. I hope buy other quickly.

Beautiful phone! is perfect! all perfect with the seller thanks!
So far, so good!  Bought the ascend 2 after I cracked my Doogee phone by accident. I definitely can notice a faster, more smooth motion when scrolling, selection in, and browsing on this phone in comparison to my cracked one. I ordered a T-Mobile Sim and Kingston SD card along with it, which both have been working properly. The battery, like everyone says, is nice. Lasts long above 70% then I thought it would. One thing I must point out is the camera, which purely amazed me how well it took photos. The flash is so bright it lit up my entire room while I sat in the complete dark o. O All in all, I love this phone <3 What's even better is I found a whole assortment of good looking cases for the huawei ascend while poking around online. They'll help in replace of the Trident Cyclops case that always seem out of stock.
My son says it's great.
Great phone!  Phone's great. Product arrived exactly as expected.
Very happy. Phone is like new.
Samsung strikes again  Very fast processor. Would recommend.
Just What Was Needed  One of our users was less than cautious in using his phone (these are anything but durable) and, in the ensuing tumble, his phone's screen was completely unusable.  Our cellular carrier wanted $600 for a replacement phone, so this was far, far more reasonably priced;  however, $400 is still a chunk of change for a less than resilient and robust piece of equipment.
Product amazing and it came with a screen protector already so that saved me the trouble of getting one
very good
very easy to put on my Samsung J5 and a very good fit.
excellent  This phone has is ALL. It is easy to see (I have less than perfect vision) and it is ahead of the rest with it's technology.
Love it!
Love it!  Love this phone I can't think of any negatives yet. Love it doesn't come with carrier garbage apps all over it that can't get rid of. Ready to go pretty much out of the box.
As advertised... unlocked like-new Nokia 520.  As advertised...unlocked like-new Nokia 520.  I'm raring for an international trip where I'll just buy a SIM for $20  Dan
Works great, no problems.
Good  Looks great ... only problem facing sometime very few time hang
fantastic phone. I love it.
Nice price.
It is what I expected!!!  This mobile phone is really excellent and I am very happy with it. I only would like this windows phone to be compatible with 'android' applications. Is there a way?  Thank you so much.
Expectations met.
Great phone  It very good phone
Just as described!!  Perfectly described! The only thing wrong with it, was there was a couple dings on the corner of the phone. Works perfectly fine and used it with the Straight Talk Bring your own phone package. Exactly what I wanted. It even came in before the delivery date! Thank you!!!
Everything was as expected
I purchased this for my 17 year old grandson. He loves this phone. He said it was very fast to load whatever games he plays.
Samsung S-4  First time I bought a pre-owned phone. Delivery was quick and phone is working ok.
Excellent!  I bought it for use in Venezuela with online MoviXXXX and I have not presented any problems. Came with your screensaver placed. Excludes handsfree headphones, so it must be purchased separately. From factory comes with windows phone 8, but could do the upgrade to 8.1 without problems or rooting or anything. The camera is good, just do not have flash LED and in dark places the pictures taken will be corrected to make it look lighter. Wifi and 4G connection smoothly. An android for a similar price gives memory problems all the time. You can download it BBPIN, Whatsapp, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. For me this cell phone is excellent.
What can I say.  I think samsung makes great products.  My last phone was the samsung galaxy s4 and it worked fine.  Untill I decided I needed a upgrade.  So I got myself the Galaxy S7.  This phone can do no wrong in my opinion.  The phone comes with a 32gigs of memory and it also has a  slot for a micro memory card, you can decide how much more memory you need for this phone up to 299gb.  The phone comes in a sleek onxy finish.  It is thin and smooth.  The camera is awesome on this phone with a 12 megapixal on the rear, 5 megapixal on the front.  It also has a feature to shoot in low light and the pictures come out aswsome.  The s7 is also water resistant for 30 mins and up to 5 feet of water.  You can also  make your phone unique by using the features to change the background etc.  Other brands you would have to jailbreak the phone to custom it.  The battery is fast charging so if your in a hurry your phone is to and always ready when you are. I do not work for or am I affiliated with either the manufacturer or the seller of this product. I always read user reviews when purchasing products, whether online or in a store. I appreciate the effort of those who write comprehensive and detailed reviews and hope that my review has been helpful to you. I am sure if you have any other questions or concerns you can ask them directly in the comment section.  Thank you.
I love my iPhone, never hade one before now
and I couldn't be happier. I'd definately do business with them again  Phone was more than I could have asked for honestly.  Got it in my hands, and not a ding or scratch on it at all.  Only issue I had was the idiots at my local Verizon store who didn't know how to friggin' activate the phone.  Told me the phone wasn't Verizon Compatible, when it clearly was.  Anyway, I've got the phone working now, on my account, and I couldn't be happier.  I'd definately do business with them again!
Excelent product  Excellent product, I like this phone, only one observation is that the phone is a little slow processor. Thank you
Best phone in the market  I LOVE IT! I am not a big fan of apple because of the way they lock their software and in all honestly I hate iTunes... I got used to Android and absolutely loved this phone! Great functionality, awesome screen and it just does a lot.  I recently changed it for an iPhone 5 because I got the iPhone from work, but I do miss my Galaxy 3. Siri is better on the iPhone, I'll give apple that, but on the rest, I'll stick to the Galaxy, for sure!
Stunning phone for the price. Absolute powerhouse.  Excellent phone.  I wish I could have bought it directly from Google to save a lot more money, but I needed a phone immediately for work.  Pros: - Always up to date with Google's latest OS version. - Great build quality. Feels solid in the hand - Crsip HD display - Powerful hardware. Everything is fast, fluid, and responsive. - Plays mobile games without any trouble (I've been playing Anomaly: Korea all day)  Cons: - No expandable memory (Only true con in this list) - Average battery life (Offset by quick charge time and wireless charging) - Mediocre camera (Not really a con. It gets the job done well, just not HIGH quality) - Awkward speaker placement/sound muddled - Screen colors seem off slightly (Hardly noticeable until you compare it to other phones) - Awkward power button placement - Phone built for those with larger hands
Baugh used. So far no complaints.
buen producto
this is a cool smart phone  excelent used product
Great phone and absolutely love its performance. Worked fine with Rogers Canada carrier.
It is great!  This phone was for one of my daughters. She absolutely loves it!
Really worth it  It is in great condition. Brand newww
Arrived at time. Perfect
It is really a great smart phone  come with a box that contains everything. It is really a great smart phone. The size of the screen is a bit bigger than my expectation, which is because I do not have a clear sense about sizes described in inches; but, it is ok to me.
good
As described and shipped fast.  As described, no problems setting it up, and shipped fast.
I have no problems
love it
Love this phone  Love this phone. Fried it several times screwing around with rooting it but this beast is unbrickable. Anyways if you want to root around this is not the phone for you because it bricks up every time for different reasons. But as far as devices go this is one smooth operator as long as you don't mess with it.
We had the S7's but the battery expanded after 18 months so we bought the note 4.  It is great, the camera is wonderful (there is a plastic film that needs to be removed when you first get it), phone works great and the battery is removable which means it can be replaced if necessary.  Really sorry we did not buy these phones before and saved all that money wasted on the S7 because of course Samsung is not standing behind their phones, they are acting like nothing is happening therefore they don't have to replace it.
Excellent  this is a excellent phone, fast, beautiful screen, good camera, brand new, it doesnt sound as desired but its enought good for most of users, I don't need more than this
This is a really good product  This phone is great it was exactly whati wanted and it shipped in good time I would recommend this item to anyone.
I love my new phone  Great Cellphone! Fast Shipping! No complaints!
Excelente
Best Samsumg Phone I've Ever Used  I bought this phone from T-Mobile and it is amazing. It has a very quick and smooth  interface and it just looks beautiful. The only things I don't like are the lack of SD card compatability and the default launcher, the latter was easily fix by downloading a different launcher.
EXCELLENT
Good Product  Excellent!
PERFECT!!
100%  Actually, this is an excellent product, and it arrived very fast. In addition, it's quite strange for me to get a smartphone without a headphone. It's always like that?
everything was great.  Came in a bit late, other than that, everything was great.
Make sense
good product
Very good product, excellent condition
It works well and is still running strong after having it for over 18 months.
Cleeeeeaaannn white Iphone 5c.  I was worried at first considering the low price but I'm very happy with the my 5c it had very very small scratches and I was able to put an ATT sim in before switching to cricket wireless.no problems. 5 stars all day.
Happy with my Samsung  The Samsung J7 is just what I had hoped for. I was looking for a phone with a good camera and sufficient storage. I have downloaded several apps and still have plenty of room for more. So far I am very happy with this phone.
good
fine thanks
Works great considering I'm on it now
Genuine and original, looks like new  The seller was polite and resolved my query quickly. The product was genuine and original. They provided cable, charger and headphone. I would buy it again and refer to my friends.
Worth upgrading!!  Definitely a go!! I love the marshmallow, its awesome. The camera is nice, better than nexus 6. The speakers are front facing and loud. The motion and gestures are great, finger print scanners works 100%. But listed price is too high, available cheaper in google play.  More detailed review :-  Nexus 6P is a great presentation in form of a 5.7 inch phablet after Nexus 6. Its much cheaper than Nexus 6 and a premium phone in same range of iPhone 6S Plus or Galaxy Note5. It's an improved version of Nexus 6 with an added  'P' now where P stands for not only premium but also performance.  The best features of Nexus 6P are : 1. Design - Metallic and glass finish. Completely new look from other google Nexus phones even Nexus 5X. Its totally manageable by one hand now rather than the previous Nexus 6. It comes in 3 colors Aluminum or Grey,Graphite or black and Frost or white. with a 5.7 inch display and quad HD resolution its definitely a go. Nexus 6P is smaller in display, narrower and lighter than Nexus 6. Speakers are front facing. 2. Fingerprint Sensor - It has fingerprint sensor at the back like Nexus 5X which is quite different from other smartphones having fingerprint sensor at the front . But its very easy to use your index finger at the back rather than your thumb. 3. Fast charging and quick data transfer is possible in Nexus 6P . 4. Very good camera resolution - 12 mp camera can now record 4k resolution videos which is great advantage as a smartphone user.the sensor with a 1.55 micron gives best result under low lightning condition. 5. Marshmallow - Latest version of android 6 is operating system Marshmallow. No doubt all the latest version always comes from google nexus. 6. USB Type-C reversible converter- with Nexus 6P you can enjoy usb type-C reversible converter when connecting to other media devices. 7. Other important Sensors - Nexus 6P also comes with very important sensors like Accelerometer, Gyroscope,Ambient Light etc. 8. Good Battery Life - 3450 mph battery can last for 2 days after normal usage which is pretty good. 9. Very good processor - Very good processor along with Adreno 430. 10. Gorilla glass Screen protection - Screen protection is by Gorilla Glass 4.  Now the not so good aspects of Nexus 6P in my eyes are  -   1 .No micro SD acrd slot.   2. No wireless charging.   3. No dual SIM support.   4. Not water and dust resistant.   5. No radio station- There is no radio station for a radio lover like   me.   6. No removable battery - Battery is not user replaceable.  Besides these few not so good points Nexus 6P surely rocks!!!
Excellent phone for the money  Bought this S4mini for my wife, the performance of the phone is seamless, properly optimized with unnecessary apps off or uninstalled and turning of WiFi when not in use gives about 12-18 hrs standby. In order to achieve this you must turn off WiFi, sync and mobile data overnight (DU Battery Saver FREE does a great job of this with sleep mode), you can still get texts, calls and use the alarm. Another note, we have poor signal in our house and when transitioning from home to outside we have had problems getting back signal, just turn off power saving on the phone and make sure you have selected GSM/CDMA Auto in in mobile networks settings (should be default) and you're golden. I also got her a Rav Power 3000Mah external battery charger for those long heavy use days, it charges the phone to 100% in 2hrs just like the wall charger.
EXACTLY AS ADVERTISED!  I can only echo the other customers satisfied with Kyle's excellent service.  I appreciated that your description of the phone allowed me to understand what I was buying.  I'm a techno dummy so it is terrifying to fork out a couple of hundred dollars without really knowing what I'm doing.  Thank you so much for making this technology competitively priced!  I bought this phone for my husband so that he could use it for straight talk. Even a t-dummy like me was able to make it work.  This was my experience in June 2013. 1. Faff around pulling your hair out because you don't understand what the hell to do. 2. Watch about 450 instruction videos on youtube. 3. Blunder around online trying to make sense of a million different instructions and finally call the straight talk help desk, which was actually helpful....  This is what I really needed to do to make the iphone work: 1. Purchase an unlocked AT&T or T-Mobile Iphone.  Don't get Verizon or Sprint in this case. I used betterdealsfaster and a guy called Kyle Wunderli.  Check out my review on that service if you want to use him. 2. Purchase a straight talk sim card. 3. Purchase straight talk minutes or use your credit card to set up a monthly payment for the minutes. 4. Purchase a micro sim card. 5. Use the micro sim as a template to cut down the huge straight talk sim.  Make sure you cut AROUND the shiny metal surface! I guess you can buy a sim cutter online but I just used scissors. 6. Go online OR call straight talk to activate the straight talk sim. This is also when you will transfer your number from your previous provider. 7. Now you can follow the steps on any one of the MILLIONS of youtube videos which will tell you how to fix the APN settings on the iphone 4 for straight talk. 8. Use and love your new iphone with all that juicy data-ry stuff and wonder why the hell AT&T doesn't even try to compete with this new company.  At the risk of sounding amazingly paranoid, I feel like a consumer sheep being led to corporate slaughter.  We'll all know when the other shoe drops but until then, I love this cheaper phone system.
Everynthing good, super fast shipping
Quite happy.  Excellent phone for the price. Still compares well with the newer offerings in the market.
Excelent  Samsung Galaxy Note II is excelent. For who is looking for a complete produt it is perfect. I recommend it.
ok
life of a excellent phone.  phone is excellent.it has 16gb of internal storage.is excellent to use.it is good on batteries.its price was the lowest.i use it as a pay as you go.i do not ever want another contract phone.they really rip you off.when the price comes down for the samsung galaxy 3.i will get that one.it is loaded with internal memory.i was able to examine one.i like it.if i could trade this one in for one,i would do it.what they offer you for this one is much to cheap as this is a excellent phone.i will wait.
Muy bueno!!
... a new LG Nexus 5x and its works absolutely great.  I bought a new LG Nexus 5x and its works absolutely great.
Very nice Android phone  Very nice Android phone. Super large screen and battery. Lower price. Although I think iPhone's UI is faster and better than Android, I think for this price you will get a very high cost performance phone compared with other Androids. And some news indicate Mate 2 will be able to upgrade to 5.0 version in the first half year of 2015. I used Galaxy S4 for one year with 2.5 times purchase money than Mate 2, but for daily use, I can't find something better really worthy for that high price. Attached pics. (with an iPhone 6)
No issues. Works flawless. I already have the 5x so it isn't much difference with the exception of the battery, screen, dual speakers and gig storage. Really a solid phone. A bit pricey but I hope this is the last phone I will buy for a while. If you need a solid android phone this is the one hands down.
i like it very much, the same as it describing online
excellent
Very satisfied  I love this iPhone. I don't have any problems with it and I've had this phone for atleast 2 months.
Very good
Excellent, I highly recommend the whole community of amazon ....
Great phone  I love it although it is missing some of the features that I loved In the samsung
... phone was delivered as schedule and it was in perfect condition. Kudos to the Seller  The phone was delivered as schedule and it was in perfect condition. Kudos to the Seller. As for the phone, it looks like a goddess. Its absolutely beautiful. The camera is amazing and the new TouchWiz to my surprise was pretty snappy except for the very rare bugs. Overall a great phone!
Good Value  Everything works well except for tethering, I haven't been able to get that working yet. It came with Windows 8.0 but it updated to 8.1 fairly easily. I was pleasantly surprised to find out it has a FM radio.
SquareTrade Warranty Review  This is one excellant Warranty for the money.  They response in a very professional manner, that puts you at ease and puts a replacement in your hand quickly.  They didn't have a replace phone for me, but they paid me full purchase retail price in a matter of hours.  They didn't take us through long worthless processes of trying to fix the old one or any of the things most insurance companies do to get out of do; what we expect.  Great company that I will buy warranties from in the future for all my electronic's equipment.  Going to buy this warranty for my IPHONE 5 over apple warranty that covers less for two years, that Square covers for three and more situations.
perfect!: )  Exactly what I expected, came with charger and earphones, perfect! :)
very good
Amazing phone... until you get a Note 4. ;-)

iPhone 6S with upgraded stronger Aluminum alloy frame and more Ram  I've owned last 4 previous iphone models as well as Note 2 and Note 4. The iphone system is very efficient at the cost of a few extra features compared to android flagship smartphones. But, that helps it be more reliable and smooth. The iPhone 6 is a beautiful handset but suffers from a very thin and weak Aluminum frame which allowed for relatively easy damage/bending. Apple got enough complaints apparently that they upgraded their iPhone 6S and 6S Plus with a new and stronger frame alloy that's also a little thickeriPhone 6S is still made of Aluminum but with a higher concentration of Zinc which adds alot of strength to it (7000 series Aluminum) a popular Youtube channel called unboxed theraphy had the iPhone 6S case elements tested at a special metalurgy company and confirmed a stronger alloy. He also tested the iPhone 6 vs iPhone 6S on a machine that measured exact pressure placed on each phone separately. The iPhone 6 resisted 30 lbs of force before starting to bend/flex. In contrast, the iPhone 6S resisted 80 lbs before starting to bend, that's 2.5X stronger. It's already known te iPhones are some of the best smartphones but with these gindings it made me feel much more comfortable upgrading one of my lines to the iPhone 6S Instead of the 6. Add to that the extra features, faster processor and now confirmed 2gb of Ram and the iPhone 6S is the much better pick. I hope this info helps somebody else make up their mind about which iPhone to get
Gracias
very good
Have a nice day.  Thank you very much. Have a nice day.

Love it with all my heart!  Would recommend this phone to anyone around the world. However, was a bit flustered at the beginning when the phone came in spanish and I had so hard to translate to figure out how to change the phone's language settings. Other than that excellent phone for anyone.

Best phone out there  I upgraded from My HTC One (M7) to this one and let me just say it feels alot better and smoother! I have been using HTC phones for the past 5 years and they have managed to never fail me. Solid yet elegant phones. Great choice for anyone looking for a solid good phone.
Great phone BUT NO earphones  The phone was in excellent condition and came with all accessories EXCEPT there were NO headphones. This being the only problem though, I am extremely satisfied.
Works great !
Arrived in no time and worked perfectly as advertised.

Very Good phone For The Price.  I have recently decide to switch from my old Samsung galaxy s4 to this phone i was looking for some but the the prices were way too high but this one was perfect and under by budget. I have had this phone for about a year now and its working fine and have not had any problems, if your thinking about buying this phone go for it its very good and comes in a very good packing so you don't have to worry about it getting damaged.
Thank you
Best  I was able to send this phone to my best friend in china where she used it for the local gsm network there. Perfect for any travelers!

What a nice phone  I was a little scare about buying this phone afraid of maybe it is not what i was waiting for. But the phone it is just great working perfect with my AT&T 3G sim card. I didn't get my 4G yet. It is fast and no problems at all. Just when you start it you have to set up the language and it is ready to go. The screen it is just beautiful very bright with deep colors. Download and surf the web sites very fast nothing to compare to other phones I think it is the best phone out till now. The videos and video games working just perfect (some mp4 videos that i had didn't work but I convert them to the right format and they look and work very nice).  Only having problems with the Wi-fi connection so I am leaving my phone just working with the data plan all the time. Well I have unlimited data so that is not a problem. And about the warranty i got one from a other company. Well the phone It is worth it the extra money. I hear that Samsung is going to release new more powerful phones but i am sure I will be happy with this phone for a long time. Sorry Apple but this is a winner.  I think Samsung really got a GREAT PHONE!!!
Perfect
Pure android  Excellent phone pure android
Good Phone i love it and now with Lollipop all about the nexus 5 works great and smooth
samsung galaxy note 2  my husband loves it. the screen is big enough for his poor eyesight ,he wants to bring it anywhere,especially on our travels abroad. but the only thing he hates about it,is he needs to recharge it too often.

All Great
Great phone  First off the seller does not make it clear that you can't just put in any Sim card and expect it to work on your carrier. If you're getting this phone for metro pcs then you have to call in and have the phone activated through them. Have your EMI number at hand which can be found by dialing *#06# after you give them the EMI number they will have your phone working within a few mins. It's such a great phone it really is. Absolutely beautiful. No regrets
We are very happy with the quality of these phones.

Good product  Good product and the shipping was good
THE PERFECT PHONE!  Okay so this phone is very ultra mega amazing and I love it!  I originally had a Focus which is a Windows Phone it's like first generation which suited me well but since I don't have an iPod I was lacking apps like snap chat and instagram. SOoooooo! I switched to the galaxy s4! I did a lot of research on this phone which I would highly recommend. There are a few minor problems that I found with the galaxy s4 which you will find listed on some of the websites if you research it, I was already aware of these problems when I got mine.  The phone over heats, I live in a place where it's cold so that didn't really bother me but boy did that phone lose all of it's battery quickly, by lunch time I had to turn off my phone so I could still call my parents to get a ride home after practice. So far this has only happened once (today), so I can say very little on this topic.  Even without overheating the he battery life isn't that long. I don't use my phone very much during school hours (DUH!) but I found that by the time practice ended I needed to recharge my phone, I've also found sometimes it takes a while for the phone to charge. I would recommend buying a case with an extra battery to help out with that, that's what I did.  If you're a huge music person... well... all I have to say is you'll be disappointed with how loud the speaker is, cause it's not very loud, at least not compared to the Focus. Headphones are fine obviously.  If you're just now switching to an Android like I did, have patience it take a little while to figure it out, but honestly the OS is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, even though old habits die hard hahaha I can almost promise you though that at first you are going to be completely lost and are gonna be asking yourself how you got to a certain window haha  Okay now for some positiveness!  The camera is amazing! The images on the screen seam like they are gonna pop out, it's almost like your holding miniature actors in your hand while they do their thing! The app selection is amazing and don't be worried about using Google Play, it's brilliant and fast! You'll love the small little details that samsung put into that phone, but I'm not gonna give those away hehe they have a lot of features that you can use that are fun to use. I haven't used all of that fancy eye stuff it has because well... I just didn't have a need for it. For you music people out there the music library is kinda really awesome and I love it, it's completely easy to use.  I cant think of anything I was worrying about with phone before I got it that I can help you guys out with, I just know that I'm completely satisfied and happy with this phone and I'm pretty sure you will too! :) I was completely worth tht insane amount of money hehe
Great product, fast delivery
Awesome buy  Love this phone, it has lots of space for games, pictures etc. It's exactly what I wanted.

good good good five stars
Good!  Cheap, Functional and nice, easy to handle and works in my country perfectly. Beside Huawei it's a good cell, I recommend it
Works really well in Trinidad, I cut my sim and pushed in and no regret buying it.
Very good
Order Placed on December 3, 2013. Still I am using the same phone, just need a battery replacement
The phone is great. Although the only thing I dislike is the edge screen if we compare it with the S6. Even with a case, my hand sometimes touches the screen, making it scroll or click unintentionally. Apart from that, it's a great phone. Some day I will also test the water resistant function. wish me luck :)
Great! Comes as if brand new.
Awesome!!!!!!!  I'm really loving this phone and it works perfectly fine. I must say that I'm a very very satisfied customer.
Exactly what I needed!  Excellent phone, in mint condition, at a very good price!  Data connections are fast and reliable via Wi-fi, Bluetooth or over the telephone network.  Easy upgrade to Android 4.4 Small enough for one handed use but with a bright and clear screen. Applications run smoothly thanks to its large user memory.  Perfect!
PERFECT! came in time and everything
It is amazing  The phone is amazing so far if you are having second thoughts  it is worthy of getting
Thanks!
Just perfect  as expected , Just perfect
A great telephone and everything was on date
excelent product
Very good price/quality ratio
Working great
my new dream phone  when i see the phone, just say omg...i love it....it's look brand new for me.the only problem is i have to go to the store to cut the sim card. Because im using t-mobile ,so it's not fit...anyway,i cant wait to use it....good to do business with...thank you so much
Still an awesome phone!
good
excelente  este es un gran celular de muy buena calidad es de los mejore que he tenido, desbloqueado, tiene todas las mejores funciones
I'm a mechanice and I've put this thing through a lot.  I'm constantly outside, in hot, humid weather and have NOT treated this thing delicately. I bought an otter box for it and have had this phone since around its release. It has never let me down. After a long time I did have to replace the battery, but hat was inexpeencive and I'm just glad I can actually do that on this phone, some new phones don't have removable batteries!  Anyways, I havn't had a single issue, and I've dropped this thing in all sorts of fluids, and tough surfaces, still works like the day i bought it.
excellent product very satisfied Cart
Authentic product at a great price.  Loved the S3 so much, I replaced it when I lost my first one.  Authentic product at a great price.
100% positive
A great product at a good price

excelente producto  lo recomiendo compre 4 equipos y llegaron a la perfeccion lo recomiendo 100% trabajan perfecto en vzla con movistar j
Great phone, but buy actual Apple accessories!  I ordered this because the 6 is way too expensive and I much prefer apple over android (1 yr apple user and 1 yr android). I was nervous of buying this online instead of apple (billing reasons/outside of the US) but it came in good shape! I got the white and I love it.  I don't like that the products it came with were boot-leg versions so I will make a trip to my local mac store and buy a complete pack because I'm too paranoid haha. The sticker on the button is REALLY hard to remove, I actually thought it came with a replaced home button but I managed to peel it off, so beware of that.
Awwe yeah  The phone is awesome had no problems connecting to metro PC's since it was unlocked purchased from seller bc4fly I believe is their name and it works like a charm. Only thing I didn't like was the packaging it came in other wise great condition phone for a great price.
Awesome phone  This is an awesome Cell phone. It was delivered on time. The box was sealed properly. I hope i can buy the samsung galaxy S iv very soon...
its good  Thanks for all the Nokia lumia 900 I arrived on time and in my house I like it is a excellent condition and as a customer I'm happy thank you very much

love love this phone!
I highly recommend this for the advanced user or road warrior...  This is the best integrated phone I have ever had the pleasure of using and I have tried everything. Since its the developer edition I can load my own software and of course use any sim practically anywhere in the world. Wish I had something like available in the US years ago.
very good product and very good service!
SAMSUNG IS A GOOD PHONE  THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT SMALL BUT A QUALITY PRODUCT BATTERY LIFE IS A LITTLE BIT SHAKY FOR THE PRICE , ITS GREAT

This is the best I've ever purchased from Amazon  This is the best I've ever purchased from Amazon. I love my phone, about to order the same for my sister
Great phone  Hi. I received the phone today.  I was nicely suprised when I found out that it was shipped almost right after I ordered!!! It came the day it should. I'm using it with attractive go phone and it started working right after inserting sim card. after few hours I really like it. It seems like it doesn't  have lte just 4g and sometimes  H+ but it still works. It doesn't have Samsung pay but I was expecting it as I did some research. I'm not sure about battery  life.  In 3 hours it went from 52 to 11% and I have battery saving on but I will see. I will dry to drain it and that charge it all the way. I will come back with more updates.  Mine was sold by wireless everything. They  really send it out fast!!!
Good Appliance!  Very good seller, send me as it was delivered as described and as expected time. I've already had a Samsung S3 but S4 is better and more quickly to work with. Galaxy S4 is the best...
Producto desbloqueado  Totalmente desbloqueado, funciona en Venezuela hasta el momento bien con Movistar
This is my second 6p. The first was for me this is for the wife. The phone is impressive when compared to the galaxy s5, which was the last phone I had. I've had mine for a little over a month now - with no issues at all. Battery life is pretty good - it has lasted the entire day at work, and I do use my phone for work when I am there. I'm usually at work by 7 and home generally around 5 or 6, and the battery has never gone below 20 %. Of course, how long the battery will last depends upon the usage but before, with the S5, I had to charge it in the afternoon while I was at work. The other thing I like about the phone is the absence of all the crap that come with most phones. This one just came with the Google apps - which was great. If you don't want any of them, it was easy to delete them. I'm using the phones on project fi and not a single problem. I can run multiple apps at the same time and I've haven't noticed anything slowing down.
good product.
Works good.
Excellent, thanks for the phone .. it's in top top condition......looks NEW.
The phone does come with a ATT software, although i had not problems to use it on MetroPCS. I had previously given a bad feedback, but it turned out that it was my mistake. nothing wrong with the phone.
Galaxy S III Mini  This Smartphone is very good. Has everything you want. Price was cheap,only thing I did not like is you need to charge battery every day.
beautiful screen  It takes great pictures and great videos.  Beautiful big screen.  Easy to download games.  It is easy to hold and use.  It was unlocked.  I used a U.S mini sim card while there and in Central America a movistar sim card and I have had no problems.  I cannot find any problems with this phone.  I highly recommend it.
Great price and love the color.
I loved the product
the best phone i have ever owned  Absolutely ! the best phone i have ever owned ,i really like this phone,great quality ! they thought of everything when creating this phone and at a great price,thanks so much  :)

I'm loving it!  I had a BlackBerry for a long time, but I had to pay every month for that stupid service, and it got pretty old also, so I decided to get a smart phone. Every phone I have looked at, it was nice but it didn't strike me, until one day walking in the mall they were exposing Note II, loved the design!!! Since I am not good with technology, and I don't really care about it, I was a bit concerned about me and touch screen and all that new stuff, I though it would take me months, so even though Note II sounded pretty spiffy, I still got it!!! I love the phone right now!!! I have been using it for the last 4 days, and its EASY to use, even though there are some stuff I had to look at it on videos on youtube, but in general, its EASY! I read a lot of articles, laws and media, and the screen size is good, it is a bit big when you talk on the phone, but I'm sure you'll get used to it! Love the phone!!!
Excellent
VERY GOOD!  VERY GOOD!
cool cell phone am useing
Perfect quality. Super fast delivered.
Unlocked Samsung S6 Edge  The phone is great! Works fine and because of it being unlocked, I can use it almost anywhere with different sim cards.
Good, solid phone

Great purchase!  This was a great purchase.  The phone was brand new and in perfect condition.  The only complaint I have about the phone is that sometimes the touch screen isn't sensitive enough and the selfie camera is a little strange, it makes me look airbrushed sometimes.... some people might like that.  These are small issues, though, and they don't take away from me still loving it.
Great phone, great price and works amazing  I needed a new smartphone since my iPhone's battery was acting stupid (although, a few months after I bought this Apple recalled my phone for battery issues and now it working great...).  When it comes to Android there are so many choices.  I chose Samsung since it is about the best contender in the Android market.  They frequently update and their software is great.  I compared this to Sony Xperia Z and the HTC something (comparable model, but do not remember which).  I chose the Samsung mainly for price and battery.  I got the AT&T version (at the time this item was listed as AT&T version), it appears to no longer be listed that way.  I use Net10 and like not having a contract, so I have to be proactive in finding a great deal on smartphones (no carrier subsidy).  I got this for around $300, which is great for this new of a smartphone.  It not the current version, but now a days nothing you every buy will be.  The specs are still great and it has amazing speed and battery life.  The phone has great audio (one of the reasons I chose this over the Xperia Z), the sound is super loud and even out does my iPhone 5.  I was disappointed that my iPhone headphones would not work properly in this (could hear and talk, but could not skip or change volume).  You do get some nice headphones with this, but I cannot wear the kind that sticks in your ears, they always fall out, and my iPhone headphones have an adapter that makes them over the ear.  This is not related to the phone, but Android is annoying with the headphone volume warning.  During my time using the iPhone, I have gotten used to Siri.  I tried the Samsung program, but it was not that great.  I then found Google search and started using it.  Not that easy, since you have to disable some stuff to get Google to be the default voice assistant.  After some research and messing around I finally got it where I can use Google search and the OK GOOGLE.  At first OK GOOGLE worked all the time, but randomly it started only working when I had the phone active (screen had to be on).  The camera is amazing on this phone, it offers a lot of neat filters and special shots, but truthfully you are going to use the normal camera, which takes amazing photos (if you change it to 4:3 you can get the highest resolution, not default).  I have played with the camera features, and while they are cool, they require more prep than normal use (getting subject ready...), so I do not use them often, more of a 'check out what my phone can do' thing.  Stock browser is terrible, use Chrome.  Chrome is great, and I am not sure why they still even load the stock browser.  Chrome works as expected and is super fast.  You can sync with desktop Chrome (linked to your account) and I have not had any issue browsing the web, "Request Desktop Site" is about the most useful feature ever for mobile browsers.  There is no Flash, but that has been long removed, and most sites have moved on, so not a big deal to me.  When I got the phone I spent a lot of time removing the crap apps, these are the apps that AT&T loads and Samsung loads, and that you will never use.  They are also made where you cannot remove them (I am not rooting).  You can at least disable/hide them from launcher and that makes life a little better.  I think I should be able to remove any apps I want (that would not cause the OS to become unstable).  I was able to update to KitKat after a painful waste of time dealing with the AT&T updater.  Apparently you cannot update except with OTA.  Everytime you try to update, if it fails you will get a check again in 24 hours.  Really annoying.  I found that you can change system time 24 hours in the future and it will let you check.  I had to do this several times until I could finally get it to work and say Android KitKat was available...  Do not go crazy jumping into the future; just do the minimum each time, so when it finally works, you are not locked out for years... You could always repeat this process for future updates, but it is still annoying.  I find Samsung Kies useless.  Just put the Micro SD card into the computer and copy your stuff over to it (Movies, Music), and pop it in the phone.  If you want you can copy it from the phone to local storage, but I personally keep apps on internal storage and images/music/movies on the SD card.  This works great for me.  Fancy features on the phone are endless, and for the most part not going to work.  All of the fancy voice commands and gestures are very sporadic and sometimes work.  The only one I find useful is the wave your hand over to get a quick view, it looks cool in meetings and shows you a quick glance of content.  I have not used any of the other features and I did try, but most just stopped working properly.  A cool feature I was looking forward to was the eye detection (look away and the movie pauses).  I found it often doing the opposite, look away it keeps playing, look back at phone it pauses.  I found it more pausing when I tried to watch than anything.  I disabled this.  Cool in theory, but I guess it cannot detect my eyes properly.  This has Google Play and Google Services, which is really the only way to enjoy an Android based device.  Without those you will not be able to use Google apps and other apps that rely on Google services.  This allows this device to use the Amazon Appstore (great for free apps and loads of giveaways and free credit) and Google Play, the home of pretty much all Android apps.  It does offer a feature where you can use split screen with certain apps and can put some content on the bottom and other on top, this is a neat idea, but a screen this small does not make it all that useful.  I keep it off, but made it one of my main items in the notification center, so I can enable it quickly if I need to type an email while looking at a webpage or something.  I am not going to go over the petty problems I have with Android (like difficulty of quickly seeing emails, and my hatred of the primitive notification system), because it is tough going from iOS to Android, and apparently Android L will fix most of my problems, and this being a Samsung device it will probably get the update pretty quick (I would say Samsung is about the quickest with Android updates).  The battery life on this phone is amazing and it works great, I do keep it in Power Saver Mode all the time, and I do not see any different in use vs regular mode.  By the end of the day I usually still have 30-50%, and only when I was at the airport playing games for several hours, did I ever get below 10% at the end of the day.  You can also keep a spare battery on you which is nice, I personally have a backup battery device that allows me to plugin.  Games on this are amazing! I have been playing Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and it is super clear and fluid with no lag.  The device handles it amazingly and it looks and feels the same as it did playing the game on my PS2.  I will note playing games will drain the battery, but that is expected (as the CPU,GPU and screen are all working overtime).  All of the regular things works as expected, GPS works great, Bluetooth works great (it has Bluetooth 4, but very few apps offer the same level of support as they do for iOS), screen offers great brightness, but is easy to see and work with in very low levels (for battery saving).  I have not had any issues with WiFi or cellular.  I use Net10 with an AT&T based SIM and I have full LTE service and speeds are as expected.  MMS and SMS work (if coming from iOS, be sure to disable iMessage or your iPhone friends cannot message you).  The device arrived unlocked (it was an AT&T branded device), and accepted a T-Mobile SIM with no issue.  Comparing Specs to the Galaxy S5, I would not pay the price difference.  I am happy with this and it is a great phone.  It was much cheaper than any current S5 deal, and if you are like me using prepaid, this is a great choice for a super amazing phone that is affordable and gives you the power you need.  I am happy with this phone and highly recommend it!  Compared to the other Android devices you will most likely not find as many accessories or get as fast of updates as you will with a Samsung flagship phone, even if it is a previous model.

Fantastic Phone, upgraded to Nougat on Verizon. Not interested in Pixel XL.  So i've been eagerly awaiting the Pixel XL, and as the specs have come to light and seeing very little in terms of reason to spend an extra $200. on the newer phone, i've decided to go the 6p route.  Getting it working with Verizon. Ok, i come from a Galaxy S5. So i had the Micro-SIM card from Verizon, not the Nano. So i just looked up on Youtube how to get the nano SIM. Turns out you can sand down the micro card and it'll work just fine. I just completed it and the phone is working 100%, call clarity, the whole bit. If you have a fingernail filing board, (Emery Board) that's what i used. No issues with Verizon. Once i got it to Nano size, i simply plugged it in and it started to work. No hassles.  Next, getting it upgraded to Nougat. So i heard there were Factory ROM's for Nougat and the 6p. Sure enough, i installed 7.0.0 (NRD90U) from here: [...](This phone is known as 'Angler' in Android world.)  And that was about it. From unboxing to fresh nougat install, was about 45 minutes. The flashing was about 15. The rest was setup using HiSuite Huawei USB drivers. And ADB/Fastboot setup.  Amazing phone, love the features and i'm so happy to be off Touchwiz and all that bloatware. You can immediately see the difference coming from a Samsung phone. While i love their hardware, i couldn't root the phone and finally said screw it, and went 100% Android. And though i've only had the phone a few hours, i can already tell it's going to be a great relationship.
muy bueno
lot better then the at&t one. I got first.
it is better than is is described  it is better than is is described, it looks like new condition, it has not any sign of usage. Thank you very much.
Smooth transaction good value  Smooth transaction good value
iPhone or Galaxy S3? no way!!  I got the S3 yesterday, since I owned a iPhone 4S here the comparison:  DESIGN: Galaxy S3 design is stunning, the feeling on hands is incredible. The ergonomics makes all the difference. The iPhone 4S is very squarish and definitely more solid but heavier too (way heavier); SCREEN: Galaxy S3 screen is wonderful with vivid colours and sharp imaages, 4,8 inches vs 3.5 of the iPhone, after you make the transition you won't never come back, impossible. OPERATING SYSTEM: S3 usability is a boom. iPhone is good but never at the level of the S3, way way slower. BATTERY: S3 gets full day + 30% remaining battery, iPhone last till four or five PM; GPS: Galaxy S3 gets locked in less than 10 seconds inside a building, iPhone searches and searches with no success; CAMERA: they are very similar, S3 is faster and iPhone is may be a bit better in term of quality. No dramatic difference. S-VOICE vs SIRI: they are both very basic and more fun than usefull. USB-BLUETOOTH: iPhone only works with iTunes, no Bluetooth, no radio. Galaxy S3 can be usb-connected to computers and flashmemory, it has easy bluetooth connection and yes ... it has an amazing radio :) APPS: to be sincere, all relevants apps in iPhones are present in Android. They have better design but they are at payment while in Android are always free. No mayor differences.  Galaxy S3 is an extraordinary good purchase. Recommended for all ex-iPhone users. You won't regret, there is a world outside iTunes :)
Great device - have been using it for a year and a half on Straight Talk.  I bought this phone new and run it on Straight Talk. Have used it for a year and a half with not a single problem of any kind. I love that I can turn it to landscape view and see full Web sites (not just mobile versions). Also functions as a nice e-reader. Great for when I'm on the road and don't want to carry a phone, tablet, etc. Easily runs Google Docs, etc., so I can get work done, too. Excellent device, and I love the big screen. I do recommend a screen protector and a good case ... my Empire Klix leather case is a perfect fit with great protection plus access.
It's amazing. It's really working great
very good. everything was ok.
... that it came without headphones but it is a great inexpensive phone  I was surprised that it came without headphones but it is a great inexpensive phone. With all the samsung apps and conectivity. I use it in Venezuela and works well with Movilnet. The charger was the correct one too!!

Very good
perfect conditions and happy customer  Item came as described, perfect conditions and happy customer, definitely would buy any item from this seller again.
Best phone ever!!!!!  To me this is the greatest phone i ever had.. I fine it is really beautiful in colour and size. So if i had to purchase it again i would. The pictures are clean and plus it has a flash in the front and in the back. The filling of the phone is lightweight and the battery is removale. To me this is better than any Samsung s4 or s5 .
Excelent cellphone
its good  love it
Awesome nexus - lightweight and comfortable to hold while big enough for most uses.. Plus USB c charging, feels more robust than micro USB.
The speakers sound a little muffled. However, everything else was up to par with the high quality you expect from Apple.
Everything was in great shape nothing to complain about! Well done.
all excelent
This is really good and I am so happy to using this Mobil.
Superb, just as I expected except for the charger that is US made given that I am in the UK.
Works well.
10/10.  I wish this phone came upgraded to 6.0.1, but it was fine waiting for the charge and upgrading it. The phone itself is amazing, and the sellers are fast on shipping.
NICE  This product has exceeded my expectations cart. Recommended for future purchases. Very responsible, all information is correct. BUY HERE AGAIN

Love it.  Was posted as brand new,  and truly was brand new.  Shipped free.  Encountered no problem.  Very satisfied.
Great phone. Though  Great phone. Though, its hard to get accessories for it (I know its not one of the newer phones out). No one here seems to carry HTC stuff (at a decent price anyway).
Awesome product  this product is just wonderful and the price is just great, it works perfectly and you should buy it if you are planning on doing so.
Great!!!  Excellent I recommended!!!

This is a great phone for my purposes  This is a great phone for my purposes.  Got it because it has a user-replaceable battery.  It's very sleek and stylish as well.  The modules are a cool concept as well.
excellent phone
AMAZING  I LOVE this phone! It has been able to run every game from the app store. The battery life is fairly good. The new 3D touch feature is a cool feature, but it isn't something i can't live without. The touch ID is almost immediate. You can just tap the home button, and the phone is unlocked. If you want a superior phone, I HIGHLY recommend this phone.
excellent  OK, excellent seller
A smartphone in between Galaxy S4 and Galaxy S5  This smartphone is a little rocket science. Full of options, very qualitative and also a good deliverance. I recommend it.
and work like the best phone in the market  cheap, and work like the best phone in the market. I like this phone more than an iphone xD
Perfect for the price.
I like this cellphone. It works as I expected without any problem. All taken pictures are clair.
The product is excellent. The service very good. Thanks
Its very good ^~^
It was a great product everything i expected however i thought it was gonna be a D851(T-Mobile) model however i got a D855(International) model
So far so good  I'm still trying all the features... so far so good. Although, the battery heats notably when I use the web.
I like it so Mutch

Product as expected  I am fully satisfied with this purchase. Its nice phone. I agree with its rating of Like New. Like new should be like new and not used.
I love it  I'm very impressed with this phone great battery life nice design awesome sound quality and impressive picture quality. I'm running Android 7 I upgraded soon as I got the phone camera is also good.
Nice
GF2 - powerhouse  This phone is a great value for your money. Switching from iPhone to android, I was scared of UI lags. But this phone doesn't have much lags except when the UI is being benchmarked for 20+ minutes. The front camera is not that great but can capture good pictures(if you're not specific about selfies). The battery is a beast. Believe me, it lasts for more than a day with wifi and 4g connected and put on constant use. 810 snappy, 3gigs ram and a 32gig memory, all packed in a budget price. I would recommend anyone this mobile.
My husband loves his new phone!
EXELENTE
A+++++++  Awesome product and condition! I recommend!
perfecto
I love this phone I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a awesome iPhone
The device was used , but in a very good condition. It was unlocked as described and delivered on time. I am very pleased with this purchase.
I got the great product. I love it
I am completely satisfied with this  It is well working. I am completely satisfied with this product
I really like my samsung phone from Amazon  it arrived just as it was described in the posting in a timely manner excellent condition I am very satisfied with my purchase
fast delivery.. Works awesomely!!!!!!
... you so much for your cell my son i love  thank you so much for your cell my son i love it
It's amazing! I loved.
2nd one, liked the first one so much I have to get another, but that's what happens when you kill the first one. 8 feet under water for 22 hours will do that.
I'll upgrade to 16gb soon  Perfect all the way around but if you are a big music fan I recommend getting the one with mor&eacute; storage, this iPhone has 13 apps and I can only fit about 80 songs
great for what I needed
as advertised, good fast seller  Good product, good seller
Best phone ever had  Samsung maybe did this phone too good for their own interest. Unless I lost it, I see it difficult to change it in two or three next generations, maybe for S10 will. Speedy, beautiful display, all the apps run well, enough space, the comeback of the external sd was great and now with Android 7.0 cannot be better.
I am inlove with my IPhone  Very good services, congratulations worldwide I am enjoying my new Baby, its very cool my phone. I like it very much
Awesome phone. Best one I had by far.
Excelent product!!!  Excelent product!!!

Excellent product recommended.
Excellent condition phone and I am very happy with the condition
Good phone.  Excellent phone, esasy to use, fast and good screen
The Best Sub-$500 Smartphone  $320 for this phone was an absolute steal.  Let's break this phone down part by part.  1. Build: You can NOT take the back cover off in order to expand storage. The SIM tray is located on the side of the phone. However, the aluminum body of this phone makes this phone incredibly sturdy in the hand. The Gorilla Glass on the front is very smooth around the edges as the side of the phone connects to the front. This gives the phone a very luxurious feel. Overall Build Score: 9/10 (-1 for its non-serviceable design)  2. Storage: This phone comes in a cheaper 32GB model, as well as a more reasonable 64GB model. 32GB may be enough for most people, but this phone is clearly designed for a more particular audience in mind. This is where the 64GB model is more reasonable. I currently have all the updates as well as over 32GB of music on this phone, and still have 25+ GBs left. With the 32GB option, I would be in a bit of trouble. Now that they offer a 64GB option, however, the score for this phone is bumped up a bit. Overall Storage Score: 7.5/10 (would be higher with expandable storage option)  3. Display: This phone sports a 5.5 inch display with a CGS-based LCD panel, operating at a native resolution of 2560x1440. I must say, this phone literally "shines." The display alone proves that this phone is a flagship device. This may not be Super-AMOLED, but with this quality, it really doesn't need to be. Colors are absolutely beautiful, and playing 1440p videos from Youtube shows how beautiful this display truly is. The touch sensitivity is spot on and the viewing angles are astonishing. Overall Display Score: 9/10 (It COULD be Super-AMOLED, but doesn't need to be at this price)  4. Hardware: This phone packs a beast of a processor (the 8-core Snapdragon 810) with the Adreno 430 GPU. This phone can, and will, run anything you throw at it with ease. Surprisingly, this thing doesn't overheat like most devices sporting this chipset. At first it gets considerably warm, but never to the point of worry. Surprisingly, it got better over time with updates. I can manage to play an intensive game on it for a considerable amount of time before it even begins to warm up, and when it does heat up, it seems to stabilize and remain at a constant temperature. I am not sure what ZTE did to help alleviate the overheating issue, but it works.  Furthermore, this phone packs a massive 4GBs of DDR3 RAM. Any tech enthusiast will appreciate this feature, especially those that multitask, as this phone does so with ease. Overall Hardware Score: 10/10 (This device is already overkill in the hardware department)  5. Battery: This phone sports a rather average 3000mAH battery. For the Snapdragon 810 running within this, I would have liked a larger battery. However, this phone can get you through the day with average use. On the plus side, this phone features Quick Charge 2.0, and I must say that it charges incredibly (and I emphasize that) fast. Overall Battery Score: 7/10 (It could be better given the high-end hardware, but is made up for in extremely fast charging time)  6. Speaker: This phone features a pretty impressive front-facing speaker. It does NOT have stereo speakers, so do not let the mesh design fool you. Regardless, for the one speaker it does have, it sounds good, and can get loud. That's about all I can say for this category. Overall Speaker Score: 8/10 (stereo speakers would have been nice with this design)  7. Primary Camera: This phone packs an impressive dual-lense rear camera, the primary lense being 13MP, capable of taking very high-res photos (and believe me, they look spectacular). The focus on this camera is pretty good, and the speed at which the camera operates is fantastic. Low light photos could be better, however, although still not nearly the worst. The camera features a special bokeh mode as a result of its secondary (although somewhat gimmicky) OmniVision 2MP lense located above the main 13MP lense. The bokeh mode is a lot of fun to mess around with, and with some practice, you can pull off some professional-looking photos. The manual mode offers a TON of adjustable settings to toy around with to help capture that perfect shot when you have the time. Otherwise, the auto mode does an extremely good job at taking quick photos on its own. As a side note, the adjustable dual-LED flash works great as a flashlight, and can be extremely bright. Overall Primary Camera Score: 9/10 (There are a few flagships that give this camera competition, but those phones cost 2-3 times as much)  8. Front Camera: The front-facing camera comes in at an impressive 8MPs. However, this number sounds more impressive on paper than it actually turns out to be in practice. In day to day use, the "selfie" camera (as many will call it) is average. It is by no means terrible, but it isn't quite the best put in a phone as of right now. However, it certainly gets the job done, and can pull off some decent photos in good lighting conditions. Overall Front Camera Score: 7/10 (It takes decent photos, but does not match the specs of the rest of the phone in practice)  9. Video: Yes, I am separating the video capture from the primary camera. I have seen, time and again, lacking video on phones that take decent pictures. This is simply not the case here. This phone is capable of taking very crisp 4K videos at 30FPS without a hitch. Run it in 720p, and you can capture video at 120FPS. That framerate leaves room for a feature that is becoming more common in flagship phones: slow motion capture. And boy does this phone capture slow motion well. Many phones, even flagships, feature slo-mo capture, but have a little lag in the final output. That is not the case at all here. Jump in the camera, and you are ready to take a smooth video at 120FPS to be processed in slo-mo for your enjoyment, and it looks buttery smooth, easily competing with the likes of the newest iPhones (something that can't be said for most devices in this category). You can also take pictures while capturing video, which is a nice touch. Overall Video Score: 9/10 (It can always be better)  10. Software: This phone runs Android 5.1.1 out of the box, but within two updates, offers an upgrade to Android 6.0. So far, I have had nothing but a wonderful and smooth time with this OS... no hitches, no glitches, nothing. It was a seamless transition. I advise anyone that buys this phone to upgrade to Android 6.0 the moment they boot up the phone and connect to WiFi. Bloatware was kept to a minimum, and the 2 or 3 gimmicky apps they include can easily be disabled right from the start. What we are left with is a near-stock Android experience, ensuring that the 8-core processor and 4GB of RAM is ever more overkill than it needs to be. This has been the smoothest Android experience I have ever had. Overall Software Score: 10/10 (Finally, a company follows the trend that makes the Nexus/Moto series so successful, but with overkill hardware to top it off)  11. Audio (Input): This phone features an impressive AK4490 DAC, used to help your headphones pull off a more dynamic sound. As such, this phone is an extremely good music player. The included JBL E13 earbuds are the best I have ever seen shipped with a mobile device, period. In fact, I prefer them over my $40 SoundMagic E10 earbuds, which are pretty good on their own. I can definitely see why these earbuds retail at $50. JBL has been in the audio business for quite some time, and as an audiophile, I can confirm that it shows in the stock earbuds.  Regardless, marketing the DAC as "32-bit" capable is gimmicky at best, as literally no one will be able to hear the signal-to-noise ratio difference between that and their standard 24-bit playback. Bit-depth does not necessarily mean better audio resolution/accuracy. Where this thing really shines is in its ability to amplify your headphones. It is clear that this is the absolute best sounding smartphone ever developed from a DAC standpoint. The dynamic range, from an objective standpoint, wipes the floor with other flagships, and there is solid science behind this claim. The THD (total harmonic distortion) is also lower than the other flagships. Literally no phone competes in the audio/DAC category. Overall Input Audio Score: 10/10 (There is no phone that competes, period)  Summary: Who is this phone for? Everyone that wants a flagship phone that doesn't want to jump in on the latest hype of the likes of Samsung or Apple. Do I recommend this phone? It is impossible for me to not recommend this phone. You must absolutely buy this phone if you have the money. It makes you wonder why other flagships cost so much.  And yes, the Moto X finally has tough competition that isn't from OnePlus.
Unlocked and Brand New  Special Unlocked Label on the outside of the box. Item was new and unlocked as promised and in Original Packaging. Fast shipping.

iPhone in Perfect condition  I bought this phone in perfect condition and I am very happy with the product. On top of that, the price was reasonable and affordable....  Regards,  Glecio
This phone deserve 5 star, the built of the phone is good . I have drop it 2 times on the screen about 6 ft high and it didn't crack. The HTC is android in the inside but with good built quality.thank you for reading this review.
This is such a great phone. Right now for the money  This is such a great phone. Right now for the money, this is a great buy. If you think the iPhone 6 is too big for you, this can be your solution. I can only recomend that if you have the money, go for a bigger storage, 16 Gb don't allow so much, need to erase apps or photos once in a while.
Cool internaftional unlocked cell phone thanks keep on performing.
Saved money, got a great phone  Works great, and is in excellent, almost-new condition.  Very pleased with this phone.
Great phone for the price  Can't really beat the price of this unlocked phone. It has all the bells and whistles of high end phones and versatility that is unmatched
This is a great phone and it works well with Straight Talk  This is a great phone and it works well with Straight Talk. I purchase a black one From a different company Through Amazon and it was  prior to this one and it was horrible.  If you decide to purchase a Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 get it from this company.
Exactly as described
Looks way more upscale than it is  I think this phone is perfectly sized. It's about as wide as an old Samsung Galaxy S2, but taller and thinner (and lighter). Really an excellent entry level phone.  Pros: Perfect size Great screen Good cameras Good hardware Has a high quality look Dual sim Unlocked Fantastic price  Cons: Some bloatware Speakers aren't that great

What's up  my Samsung Galaxy  is broken. How is necessary to make  fixed? ??
for me the best phone
this phone is great. it work great and the sound is incredible.
I Love it..
Be aware that Galaxy S4 I9505 and I9500 are different!  Whereas the Samsung Galaxy S4 I9505 is superior in terms of processors (1.9 instead of 1.6) and network flexibility (additionally to 2G and 3G (which both have), the I9505 also supports 4G/LTE  (which is already working in many countries)  [...] [...] [...]  see also: [...]
Simple phone but useful.
Very good phone, very good value  Very good phone, very good value ... I activated with Straight Talk and works great.
Better than expected!!!!!!
Good  OK. Wish it had screen auto- bright/dim (for indoor/outdoor)
Perfect phone, awesome seller  Wow. I did not think that used, good meant perfect condition! Sure, there were a few dents on the device, but they were very small and almost unnoticeable. This was my son's first phone, and he loves it. A very powerful phone, even though it is 4 years old. I would definitely recommend this seller (zeetron) and phone, and I would recommend also not buying things new unless they are a good price, because buying it used or refurbished is just like buying it new except cheaper. Also it worked flawlessly with at&t. Thank you.
good job just what i wanted, shipping great phone great.will buy again if needed
10/10 ign dankest phone of the year.
Great phone
Pleased  I was pleased with product and service.
Decent phone for the price  The phone works great.  I swapped my AT&T nano sim out of my iphone 5 after turning off iMessage to test things out.  The phone is a comfortable size to hold.  The setup is an easy transition from an iPhone and messaging, calling, and internet both wifi and cellular data worked fine.  The camera is okay in good lighting conditions and suffers the same shortcomings other cameras have in dim light conditions.  I didn't let the battery life is great!  It's a very decent phone for the price. The battery goes to 50 after 2 full days of moderate use.  Much better than my iPhone 5. 4gLTE works fine in the US on the AT&T network.  I have not yet tried it internationally, or on the TMobile network.
Great phone  I got this phone this week. I really enjoy it. Its fast, and has a sharp and clear screen. I really enjoy that you can double tap the screen to wake up the phone and double tap the screen again to put the phone to sleep. It is a well designed phone. I had a Galaxy S4 before and wasn't impressed with the camera. The camera on the LG G4 just in auto mode takes beautiful pictures. The battery life is pretty good on the phone. The phone charges pretty fast also with the USB Cable and plug in Adapter it comes with. The only minor thing I wish LG would have designed different on the phone is put the Home, APPS and back button below the screen as dedicated buttons like the S4 has instead of using soft buttons on the screen which takes up some screen space. Its a great phone. Go check it out and see if you like it.
Perfect

Finally found this phone again!!!!!  After dropping my first G Pro in the toilet last summer I was devastated. I loved the phone so much. The phone was fast and sleek. My favorite part about the phone is the home LED button. It will show 9 different colors that you can customize to your specific notifications. Well after having a few other phones I finally found this phone again here on amazon. And hell yes I just had to have it. I would take this phone any day over a S 6 galaxy. Make sure you always close out apps and dim the brightness when not in use because the phone will die quickly.
Probably best phone right now in the 200 price range. Quick lots of space, 2 gigs of ram.
Perfect
Excellent  Excellent! and it's dual

This phone is just great.  It is faster than any devices i have ever owned. Screen resolution is fantastic.  Amazon and the seller is fantastic.  Just perfect.
LG G2 D800 - works great!  This is my second LG phone and I am very happy with my new LG G2 D800. After reading the specs, it is an extremely nice upgrade to my current phone. It is 4G, it is 32 GB memory, top-of-the line snap-dragon processor, gorilla glass, 5.5 inch high res touch screen, and updated Android. I went from 3G to 4G and really can not tell a difference but I don't do a lot of downloading. I have a lot of e-mail for work and home and it does keep up with it just fine. I use straight talk and had no problem getting it activated.  It prompted to update to the latest Android 5.0 and it works great. Super nice gorilla glass 5.5 inch touch screen - awesome color and quality. Overall, I feel like I got a great phone at a reasonable price.
I am pleased with the performance of this phone  Has met all my expectations. I am pleased with the performance of this phone.
It's almost like brand new! Out of my expectations
Fully functional and happy with purchase  Received as described. Fully functional and happy with purchase.

Absolutely amazing cellphone - functionally either how it looks like. Highly recommended.
Awesome service and product.

love this iphone  I kept debating which new smart phone to get I chose this one and I'm thrilled unlike the Windows phones this is very user friendly and easy to use
Best bang for your buck!  The phone has exceeded my expectations. I had the s4 prior to this phone and I have to say this phone is better. It's smoother and faster than the s4 and I love vanilla android. No more bloatware! I don't think I will go back to anything that's not vanilla android. The best part about this phone is that it is only $399 WITHOUT CONTACT. Thanks Google
MUY BUENO
Excellent salesman, complied with what was promised. Recommended
GREAT PHONE  LOTS OF NEW FEATURES I DID NOT HAVE PREVIOUSLY WITH MY LAST PHONE.  AS I AM SOMEWHAT ELECTRONICALLY CHALLENGED, I AM FORTUNATE TO HAVE EXCELLENT I.T. ACCESS HERE AT WORK TO HELP ME DISCOVER ALL THE WONDERFUL FEATURES.
Finally!  A Good looking smart Phone it Will be a great gift for some  body in the family.she Will love it.

iPhone 6s 128gb NEW  Bought it new and it's really nice. No complaints so far. 128gb space grey iPhone 6s NEW
I've had this phone about 5 months now. At $200 you cant go wrong. Its well built, fast, and the camera is not bad. The photo app manager is way better than Samsungs (in my opinion) HARDWARE It feels solid! very nice color, Aluminum and glass looking. I have a transparent cover and a screen protector and its great. The dual sim card are great for when traveling, I've used it with a T-mobile sim card on slot 1 and a Guatemalan carrier on slot 2 on my last trip. Otherwise i keep my microSD card on slot 2. BATTERY the battery last about 2 days with low use and 1 full day with heavy use. If i let it idle on standby it might last 3 days. GAMES I don't play games so i cant speak to its 3D performance.  Candy Crush plays as it should SPEAKERS I do play music often, and the speakers are loud and clear SCREEN it is not as bright as my previous Sony Xperia or Samsung GS4 but if you are like me and mostly use the phone in the lowest light setting..this is irrelevant. Except when watching videos under direct sunlight. UI and SOFTWARE It comes with a very nice messanger/contact/call. Different to what i was used to, in a good way. the integrated apps, battery monitor, optimizer, and couple other tools are actually very useful.  ISSUES for some reason Pandora App won't work well with this phone...idk if its a software issue or hardware, so i mostly use spotify.  BOTTOM LINE. This phone is a bargain and a great deal at this price range. Its not a high end phone nor a basic intro phone. Its for the average person who wants a reliable, solid, phone, with good battery life, and clear sounds in calls and music
very good, excelente
Thank you my phone is perfect and I love it S.McCormick
iphone works great with Straight Talk  iphone works great with Straight Talk. You have to buy a SIM card for 99 cents from the carrier's website, insert it and follow directions on the phone. very simple. phone was in perfect condition.
excellent item !!!! I'm happy !!!!
Excellent Phone .. all round.. with great battery back up. and specially in price of $249/- its great.
Awesome phone!  I loved this phone. Works great. Came fast, never had a problem so far. I ve tried it with 2 different SIM cards and both worked. 5 stars to it!
Three Stars  Great product
nice phone  goooood
It's in a great condition
excelent, this phone it worked with Movistar in Venezuela  yes , excelent , this phone it worked with Movistar in Venezuela ..
Galaxy S5 mini just the right size phone, If you don't like those huge phone that carriers are pushing for you to buy.  Purchased this as a gift. So far so good, No complaints.
Good service & accurate product description  Bought it from A & Z Tech, works great refurbished. No problem with battery, great screen protector on it (I couldn't feel the difference), everything's functional. The only downside was the scratches and dings on the phone itself. A corner of the iphone seems to have been dropped. A few other areas were nicked. But they do state that it comes with a few scratches. They're noticeable, but not real bad. Also, if you buy it from A & Z Tech, it doesn't come with charger- phone only.  -Very good customer service. -Product description was accurate. -Phone works great, TouchID is a godsend. -Battery life is great, like new. -Quick shipping
Love my Galaxy S3 phone.  The Galaxy S3 is a great phone, and a great way to save a bundle if you don't need to have the latest model.  This model was released in 2012.
thanks for the product I am very happy with the.
good, simple, small phone for everyday use
All Android Smartphones are pretty similar: some have nicer terminations  All Android Smartphones are pretty similar: some have nicer terminations, others more memory or an SD Card Slot. But the important thing is the OS and when you buy a Nexus phone you get the stock version in all its unobtrusive glory. More, whenever there is a new Android version or a Security uptdate you get it first with no hassle. I owned the Nexus 5 and I believe this phone is an improvement. The feature I most love is its fingerprint sensor: it works like a charm to unlock your phone and it also works great with Lastpass my security app of choice.
Very nice phone
works great
Got this phone for my niece and she totally love it
Awesome  Awesome phone. Got what I expected. Everything from packaging to accessories and the phone itself are excellent. Totally satisfied with the product.
The MAIN feature which makes the phone worth buying  What I truly like this phone has nothing to do with where I can use it. The feature of backing up the apps & contacts is why. After getting the phone set up without the Wi-Fi push the 6 prong circle. Find the green button labeled back up & restore. Push it & go through the steps setting it up. Set the saving location to the SD card. As u download the apps for the first time they are saved there. If u reset the phone first download the virus protection, the Google play store & games. After getting the phone set up without the Wi-Fi push the 6 prong circle. Find the green button labeled back up & restore. Push it & go through the steps setting it up. Set the saving location to the SD card. As u download the apps for the first time they are saved there. As they are updated, they are saved in another update folder. The system /restore will use the recent one automatically. BUT you have the means of keeping from filling up the SD card under the Settings section. Before you reset the phone  select Back up apps. Sometimes even though you downloaded them for reasons I don't know they may not be saved to the SD card. If u reset the phone unmount the SD card. When the phone restarts to restore it it is remounted. First download the virus protection, the Google play store, games & the entertainment apps you want by checking the boxes next the name of the apps. It is best to automatically update the system apps as well if they are on the card already. Sign into your account as normal. Go-to the app setting. If there is new updates to download. It will also update the app on the card. Besides for the ones just mentioned make sure all system apps are checked also. Instead of 2hrs of downloading the system apps alone, it may take 10 minutes +-. Connect the WiFi & set up yr account. Any new updates will be ready to install. Get the virus protection running. Yr apps u added  can be sent to the SD card to regain disk space. Go to settings,apps, and find the ones you downloaded. Push send to SD. Doing so splits the app to both places.  Under the restore app you can backup your contacts. You do need the password u set up before saving them the first time.
Good phone

Great phone and internationally unlocked  Works perfectly.. As expected and arrived on time
Very good
Great  Good value, good features, good size. The camera, speakers, fingerprint sensor, fast charge, ect. all work really well. It's not the most cutting edge phone but it's still good for the price.
it's a really cool cellphone i always use HTC  i love this style~it's a really cool cellphone i always use HTC, my next one is G11, long time ago~this is not so big for girls.
Love it.  Easiest set up I've ever gone through with a phone...that's saying a lot since this is replacing my S5 active and that phone is pretty damn awesome. I bought the international unlocked version (I'm in Texas), popped in my sim card right out of my S5 and into this one, put in the battery and voil&agrave;! As always, once I signed into my Google account everything downloaded onto my phone and all is good.
still love this phone almost 2 months later. will update again in june or july  so ive had my phone since about 1/28/16 and its been working flawlessly! i purchased it with a case and screen protector and still no a scratch. camera has the best quality of any phone ive ever had; audio is crisp and clear. the edge is in all honesty unnecessary but fun to use. you can use it for contacts, speed dial(call text or email), news and many other notifications. if you rub the side a certain way it will tell the time without turning on the entire back light. (good for night time use).  my carrier is cricket. i simply bought a sim also from amazon and set it up myself to avoid paying $25 for a $5 job. i usually have 4g signal probably because cricket uses at&t towers. overall this phone is a+ phone
Dope phone.
Excellent phone
great product
Totally recommended for the price  Bought the 32GB version, unbeatable for the price. Arrived brand new. Really fast and reliable, this is my first Nexus and I'm really enjoying the pure android experience. The camera and the fingerprint scanner are great. My only complaint is the battery life, doesn't last a full day. This is the H791 model and it's working without any problems in Argentina. Arrived with a small USB-C to Micro USB adapter. Totally recommended.
Good choice  Great cellphone overall. It has a huge screen with excellent resolution.
Excellent phone!  Excellent phone!!  I've had it for 3 weeks and have enjoyed it very much.  No issues so far with anything. The display is amazing and confortable to navigate the internet and reading emails and text messages, speakers are just great and the stock android works very well.  The Wi-Fi and bluetooth connections are fast and steady.  Both cameras are above average and the front one is amazing in low light.  I am completely satisfied with the high quality built and look of the phone.  I was lucky to buy it at an special price of $419 +tax, but I would pay the full $499 for the 32GB if I had to.  It is a phone built to last with proper care, no doubt!!  The finger print sensor is conveniently placed in the back of the phone and it couldn't work better. Battery life gets me through a day of work with no problem with reasonable use of data and several phone calls and a solid 6 hours playing videos and other apps. It takes little more than an hour to charge the battery when this is between 25 and 30 percent low, this is a big plus. I do recommend this telephone for those who want a reliable, well built, and amazing looking divise.
yeaaaaa  the phone is definitely worth the money and it has been enjoyable so far and i have no complaints at all
This mobile is everything I expected it to be. I am very satisfied with the gold color and the thinness of the mobile. Looks very stylish and the picture quality is magnificent..... Very much pleased!!! THANK YOU! It was delivered on time with no damages!
Best phone ever, so happy with it!  Not much to say about it that hasn't already been said, but I completely love this phone. It is truly amazing and really puts meaning into the "smart" part of smartphone.

I bought the lowest price one. I registered it with Verizon and it worked the way you'd expect. They have android 4.4 and 2gb ram. As of may 2016 these can be used for amazon flex, which you should google search.

Great phone. 5*  Upgraded from an Galaxy S2. Screen has alot of real estate. Very fast, some very cool features even though you won't use all of them. S-pen is great for people on the run and need to keep quick notes or can be used as note pad as well. When using transcribe I don't have best handwriting and interpret s my text well. Would recommend. Not apple bashing but does stuff an iphone cant.

SMART and resilient  What can you say, SMART and resilient. Perfect phone for me.
Came on time and was as advertised
So far so good. I'm not familiar with Windows so it's a learning process. I love the way the phone feels it seems to be worth it I know Nokia had great products back when phones first came out so I wish I got one in color now & I thinking about getting one!!!
The phone is amazing! It was also delivered ahead of time so thank you so much! Would definitely do business with this seller again :)
Love my cellphone, a amazing cellphone for a good price..Lots of.storage
Love at first tap!  I love love love my new Samsung J5 phone.  I was a little concerned at first wondering if it would work in the Bahamas (as the side of the box says US sim card only).  But when I put my sim card in it worked perfectly. I previously had an iPhone 5 and the battery would die at odd times but with this baby the battery seems  to last forever.  I can take pics with everyone else and not have my cell phone battery die. And the pictures are so clear!!! I'm also excited about the Google keyboard and swipe texting and also less restrictions with websites and apps. I must say that I'm a very happy camper and would totally recommend this phone. I'm thinking about getting one for my Mom.
Good  Nice
I like it very much.
A very good oprtion!  It's factory unlocked, GSM and works well. A good option for your younger brother, girlfriend, whomever... Came in the original box, complete.
AWSOME  Great looking iphone. Friendly customer service and support. The phone looks brand new and works great. This is my 1st Iphone ever and I am very pleased.
wonderful phone  great phone best phone ever thank you  the phone works great and helpful recommend to everyone thank you its great
Factory Unlocked = freedom  This unlocked phone works great on T-Mobile.  I just had to insert the SIM card from my old black-berry phone.  Within a few minutes, it got signal.  Because it was factory unlocked, it was updated to to iOS 6 just fine and remained unlocked afterward.  Don't buy those iPhones that are unlocked by software, because you can't update iOS.  My existing T-Mobile contract doesn't have a data plan. All I had to do was disabling 3G and Data from Settings > General > Cellular.  After that Wi-Fi works fine and I don't have to pay for a data plan.  Note that if you do a factory reset on the phone, the only way to get through the initial setup is either by having a data plan or activate via USB cable attached to a computer having iTune installed.  The condition of the phone is dependent on who you buy it from.  My copy was near perfect.
great phone.  Just loving it, great phone.
I bought the LATAM version and it works just fine in Brazil (with TIM carrier  Very fast delivery. I bought the LATAM version and it works just fine in Brazil (with TIM carrier, don't know about other carriers but i figure there will be no problem at all).  Very easy set up! So far so good!
Best hardware, best camera, and best OS  I switched from a Samsung Focus to Lumia 920 almost two years ago and there is no comparison when it comes to quality. The Lumia products shine!  As a computer  programmer who works with a whole office  of technophiles, we compare features all the time between all of the top selling smart phones and the fan boys of these devices actually seem envious when they see how far short their devices fall in comparison.  Recently I purchased a Lumia 1020 from Amazon and even though the phone  was released a year ago, it is  still the best phone  on the market today.  Best hardware, best camera , and Windows Phone  8.1 is certainly the best OS. I guess that makes me a fan boy , but the facts don't lie.

Typical iPhone, great customer service  The phone arrived as expected and was in good condition.  After about 45 days, the iPhone 5s would not turn on.  When I plugged it in, the Apple logo would show and then would it turn off and cycle back to the Apple logo.  I reached out to the seller (BlueMarbles) and they agreed to take a look at it and sent a prepaid address label.  When they received it, they stated it worked fine after charging but would continue to test it. After a short time, the phone started to cycle again.  They ended up replacing the battery and sent it back.  I am very impressed at their communication as well as their desire to help me resolve the issue.  Although the product was beyond the 30 day warranty, they still took care of it as if it was within warranty.  Based on this experience and my interactions with them, I would recommend this company.
Smartphone of 2014  Last year I had the HTC One and thought there was no way HTC can improve this phone, it was just amazing and did everything you want with no gimmicks. Then i got my hand on the HTC One M8, and I was like, "Woo" It was an actually upgrade, not an update, as it is beautiful craftsmanship, a nice camera, amazing speakers that continue to set the bar for the industry and still not gimmick. While the HTC One M7 is no toy, however, it doesn't really stand a chance against the One M8, which is simply the nice Smartphone of the year. It's fast, solid, beautiful, long battery life and a plenty of feature to make it yours.
Is pretty good and in good condition .
It's good.
Good condition  I got this for my sister and it came in great condition with everything that was needed. As long as its apple its all good.
Perfect Mobile !  I'm still in love with this mobile from Samsung!! It is still a perfect mobile phone, and I just intend to replace it for another Samsung! I do recommend it!
Excellent product, it works great  Phone  was received earlier than  expected. Excellent product,  it works great. I am a happy  customer  and I personally recomend, this phone
AXON did a good job on following things  AXON did a good job on following things: 1. The camera which makes the picture looks great 2. The sound system which brings a HIFI experience 3. The charging is fast, like I can get 70% power back in 1 hour. 4. The screen is great.  The only cons would be it eats a lot of battery when I use screen often.
Flawless Phone!!! A+++++  besides it being practically new I got it real quick and took 2 minutes to activate with my carrier! Will do business again in a heartbeat! Thanks "CELLAS"
Exceed my expectations  I received my ZTE axon 7 today with the free monster pulse headphone from Newegg.so far I am very pleased with it  for the speed ,the storage capacity and the design which is extremely well done for this new ZTE .I have it for only one day I don't see any flaw .it exceeds my expectations

Great phone. I received it through international shipment really faster than I thought. The phone is working perfect. I bought it for my wife, I already owned one which I purchased in Colombia in November. I firmly recommend it. My wife is using it through Claro Network and it is working in 4G normally.
Five Star Service  Got same day delivery , Received product with factory packing with additional international compatible plug. Switched old phone SIM card to Note 4 very easily and worked like a charm
Absolutely love it

Bought it for my son. Really likes it!!
Unlocked smartphone  It worked great, but it did not meet the international requirements for China. No Chinese language available for this phone.
New Android software 6.0 fixes battery life issue and performance.  Bought this LG G3 D851 phone from Breed via Amazon. Initially I didn't like it because it had terrible battery life along with a few other problems. The new Android 6.0 software was recently released and installed by T Mobile. The new version of software significantly improved the battery life and the performance of the phone. I strongly recommend this phone as a cost effective high performance phone. My family now prefers the new models of LG phones over the Galaxy phones.
5 stars  I LOVE this phone! I'm not a big cell phone gamer, nor do I use my cell phone as a photo storage device. I use only the basic functions of the cell phone, phone calls, texts, facebook, sometimes skype, some browsing... this phone provides everything I need and the speed is amazing! The finger print feature is pretty interesting. I also like the camera a lot!
Only thing wrong when I got it was stupidity on my part. Phone is in great shape! Just a little dirt to clean and it lookes new
The iPhone I bought was in great shape and everything works. Definitely recommend, buying more in the future
Great phone. So far so good  Great phone. So far so good, It is bit larger than I expected, but that's my fault, not the phone's. It has an incredible stand by battery life, I went to bed with 78% battery and after 7 hs, batter was 77%, once the massive screen is in use, well, it consumes the regular battery for that size. But it is good to know that the battery won't simply disappear if you leave your phone for a few hours. Great speed, great photos. I was able to upgrade to 5.0 lollipop. Mine came as T Mobile braded but when I put my Argentinian sim card it worked perfectly, so it was unlocked, just not factory unlocked.
Great phone, use it intl and the states. Comes with multiple plugs, USB charger, and headphones.
Great phone and looks very executive when in case
The ZTE Maven, is well worth the $$$!  This is a really good phone for the money. Good sound quality, with the latest Android Lollipop software and great battery life. Works great with my AT&T pre-paid account far better than an unlocked LG that I paid twice the amount for.
After almost a year of using it, it STILL works!  I purchased this Dec 2016 to replace an LG4 (I had owned an LG2, LG3, LG4 in the past two years before that and they all broke down less than a year after use). Having owned this device for a good solid 10 months, I have seen no problems with it whatsoever. The color of this device is smooth, the screen has been sturdy, the battery life is excellent and the phone charges super quickly with the fast charger. The interface is really easy to use.  I also appreciate how everything was attached in the box. There were headphones, phone case, screen protector. Of course I replaced all the items because they were not the best quality of accessory, but I appreciated the fact that I could protect the phone with all these accessories as the phone arrived instead, which saved me the hassle of looking for all these accessories online immediately. I used the phone accessories for a good 6 months before I replaced them.  I appreciate the other reviews that help explain this phone. I am still discovering things about it. I am truly happy with this and I would just highly recommend it. Living with a troubleshoot-free phone has been truly a relief!
Excelent
Really good phone for a fair price
Does this work for T-Mobile???/
Great phone
Yayyy  It arrived on time & pretty fast. Finally i found a phone that is actually unlocked. The phone is great I really like it,  very nice quality for the price. Big screen. I've always been an iPhone fan still am,  but until then for a android yes I highly recommend this galaxy. Love it. Especially the little camera features it has.
I love this phone very much especially for the price  I do not chase phone.  I love this phone very much especially for the price.
My phone meets all my needs.
Excellent product  It met my expectations, a quality product, highly reccomendable
The best iPhone to this day  If you got a iPhone 6/6 plus...It is up to you to decide if upgrading is right. Coming from an older model, this is a great upgrade. Faster in Touch ID, Safari, Etc. Cameras are phenomenal and 3D Touch is just fantastic! It's a great device all around!
Overall a great product!  Phone works as expected, significant improvement over my Galaxy S5. Overall a great product!
Good Phone for Not Much $$$$  I go this phone primarily to use in Europe with in-country accounts or sometimes for domestic travel.  I have another phone for local day to day use.  So,being UNLOCKED was a key issue and after reading some reviews I was concerned.  The phone (which is an ATT instrument) accepted my T-Mobile account with no problem.  I have a relatively cheap pay as you go plan for T-Mobile that I've used with similar unlocked phones for about 6 years now.  It works well with the Nokia 520.  Most of my other devices were Android so I decided to try a Windows phone.  After playing with it for several weeks,  I actually like it better than Android in some ways.  For the money, it was a great deal. Yes there is no flash for the camera and it doesn't have super high resolution.  However, I don't buy a phone to take pictures or a camera to make calls.  I have a good Nikon camera for the picture taking tasks.  So far, I'm happy.  However I noticed several vendors on Amazon selling the same phone for more money.

As expected
Great phone! Great price!  Great phone!  I had a Samsung Galaxy before this and liked it, but I thought I'd try the LG because it was a much better price.  I am very happy with my choice.  This phone is every big as good as the Galaxy if not better for half the price.
Phone was brand new in pkg as promised, perfect!!  I'm leery of buying phones online but needed a new phone for my AT&T account.  Sometimes a phone is advertised as new but is actually a return with the risk there was something wrong with it.  This phone was absolutely brand new in factory package.  The LG G5 is an amazing phone, just as nice as the G6 but without the expensive monthly payment.  Buyers should be sure to run the Android update - the phone comes with the original Android version from 2016.  You will have to run the update several times, it updates one version at a time but then runs great.  BTW, the G5 has been plagued with the freeze/boot loop issue.  I did buy one earlier this year with the problem and returned it.  I purchased this one and another recently (also from Amazon) & there's no issue.
it is good
excellent phone
The phone i needed  Just great
This phone is awesome, I purchase this phone for my mom  This phone is awesome, I purchase this phone for my mom, it's very easy to use, it is factory unlocked as it stated. I bought it to be used in Jamaica and it works perfectly, I have no regrets.
Great phone! You don't need more than this.  Great phone! You don't need more than this.
Awesome phone!  I bought this phone for my husband and he loves it! Great features and the camera is awesome. It's a bit pricey for a unknown brand but it's worth it. If shipping wasn't soo expensive to Trinidad I would have bought one for myself.
Its very good
Great phone. Light  Great phone. Light, small, work fast, has 4G LTE. A great way to have a cheap and up to date mobile phone.
Love this phone...much better than Iphone 5s  SO I was debating between the Iphone 5s and this phone, and am so glad I went this this one. It can get all the same aps  or close to it that does the exact same thingl as the Iphone  and have never had a problem with it after 2 months. Works flawless. (only thing I didn't care for was the phone ap that came with it(kept accidently dialing people), so downloaded a different ap, and it works so much better.  No regrets
Don't purchase at scalper prices - Amazon.com/Google store sells this.  ** UPDATE ** - Amazon now sells this phone, at the time of this writing it's out of stock. Just search Amazon.com and you'll find new listings including one from amazon.com. Best Buy should also be carrying this as well as the Nexus 5x.  ** Part of what makes the Nexus 6P so great is the $499 price tag. You're better off applying $750 (at the time of this review) to an iPhone 6s Plus or a Note 5 if you're OK spending that money. No need to reward scalping, Google will be replenishing the models on the store soon enough.  I purchased this on Google Play Store right when it was available to do so, and received it on the 28th. I side-graded from a carrier locked Samsung S6 Edge. This phone is very well rounded. Great camera, great screen, great aluminum body. But nothing about the 6P is class-leading from a hardware standpoint. The Note 5 has a more posh glass body, with a contoured curve. The iPhone 6s Plus has better placement of buttons and a slightly sharper camera. So again, I stress, this is priced appropriately at $499. It's 90% of the best features of every phone out there, at roughly $200 bucks less. It's a much better value than last year's Nexus 6 by Motorola, but Google isn't losing money on this. I'd rather spend $750 on a 64GB Moto X Pure Edition with a leather back and put a 128GB SD card in it with an extra charger or two than get the basic Nexus 6P for scalped prices. And i'm telling you as someone who has a Nexus 6P.  And to further talk people down from breaking the bank and waiting for the correct price on Google Play - Marshmallow is a Lollipop service pack with just a couple of features (one that's not particularly useful right now). It has better standby battery, which Google calls Doze. iPhone users probably don't understand what that even means, but that's because they've had Doze since the very first iPhone, Apple just never named it. It's not so much a "feature" as Google fixed an annoying problem with Android that bugs almost everyone I've ever talked to about the platform. They've also implemented Google Now On Tap. Which is laggy as heck, and may or may not give you information you want.   Long story short? Those software features aren't worth scalpers pricing either.  Vanilla Android on the Nexus 6P, isn't objectively faster than Samsung models and definitely not faster than the iPhone 6S which is benchmarked off the roof. Animations are simply more consistent. When testing this beside my Galaxy S6 Edge it didn't load any app faster than the S6. In fact the S6 has a slightly faster app launching speed. Things simply just scrolled more consistently and animations were more consistent on the Nexus 6P. I will say this: The Nexus 6P with Chrome renders webpages noticeably faster than the S6. It's a really fast web experience. Nexus did a better job managing memory (uses on average 1GB of memory less than the S6), and no bloatware which is nice.  This seems like i'm being harsh, but i'm trying to save you $250. This is a 5 star $499 experience. It's absolutely fits at this price range. At $750 this is a 3 1/2 star phone. The vanilla software and rounded hardware features are not more class-leading than a top of the line Samsung or Apple device. So think about how you want to apply your money, and just take note of my impressions.
Perfecto
would recommend again!  Great phone and great customer service!
very good
Nice phone so far.
Minor scuffs, but looks and works great. My grand daughter loves it with her new bling case.
Beyond satisfied with galaxy s6 edge  Phone is awesome and shipping was extremely fast!!!  Would definitely recommend to anyone.

Great phone. It was unlocked

It works for me  Way better than my last phone, maybe I'm crazy (and I'm not into too many apps) but I prefer the windows interface to my previous android phone.
Is ok.
Excellent quality and service so far  Excellent quality and service so far. It was as advertised-Unlocked and of use internationally. I've been able to keep connected with family and friends near and far via the apps including whatsapp, skype and imo freely and largely uninterrupted.  A good data plan is essential when not in wireless parameters plus the battery is drained quickly from having multiple activities but I'm getting excellent service since my purchase about a month ago.
good
Met all of my expectations.

this device is very great I've bought it for my friend it worked fine...
Beautiful phone.. amazing specs and great camera. Definitely recommend!!
AT&T version, or international version?  Let me clear up common questions for you.  Let's clear up some confusion about this phone.  1.  Is this the international version, or the US version?  This phone IS the international version.  It is actually the HTC One XL, or Evita model.  The US only version is NOT sold in white, and is the Endeavor model.  How do I know this?  Because I bought two of these phones used, white, from a private seller.  They have the AT&T stamp above the screen.  But I root my phones and upgrade them with custom ROMs.  In the process of rooting and upgrading these, I realize that my phones only accept the Evita version of ROMs, which means that despite the AT&T logo, they are the international version.  AT&T simply had some of these ordered with their logo so they could offer more in-store color options.  This can be confusing, but it's just a logo, it doesn't necessarily mean the hardware inside the phone is different.  Relax and buy on!  Of course, I can't speak for the sellers on here if they sell you a phone in a lesser state than they guarantee, so if you get a phone that is less than promised, contact the seller to correct it, and if needed, file a complaint with Amazon.  2.  Dual core, or quad core?  I see some grumbling about how many cores the processor in this phone actually has.  I personally have never seen the base model of these phones for sale with a quad core processor.  The International (XL) and US versions (X) of this phone both advertise dual core processors on Amazon.  I wouldn't get too hung up on the processor speed though.  With 1 GB of RAM, these phones are screaming fast, and can easily keep pace with pretty much any other phone on the market in day to day tasks. If you really, really want a quad core HTC phone, search for and get the S720E One X 32 GB or S728E One X+.  They are upgrades on the hardware level.  They look basically the same, but offer a quad core processor and larger storage capacities.  3.  16 GB storage?  32 GB?  How much storage space do these phones really have?  The original HTC One X and One XL only offer 16 GB of storage.  HTC also offered a refreshed version with a 32 GB option and quad core processor.  There is also the S728E One X+, which offers a whopping 64 GB of storage.  You have to search specifically for the S720E 32 GB or S728E if you want the closest thing to the phone sold here but with greater storage capacity.  But as far as the base version One XL sold here, it is only 16 GB.  4. Wait a minute.  I bought this phone as a 16 GB model, but total storage space according to the operating system is only 12 GB.  Why?  HTC adds an extra layer of security to their phones called "S-on", or Security On.  Their is a partition within the flash storage on the phone that houses sensitive firmware-related and hardware-related files, and this occupies the missing 4 GB of space.  Security On protects this partition from intrusion, as tampering with it could result in an unusable phone, AKA a "bricked" device.  So, don't panic.  HTC actually does us a favor by shielding us from these files.  This 4 GB of missing space is absolutely essential for the phone to operate normally.  Just be aware of this before you purchase.  If you need a phone that offers more space, I suggest finding an equivalent phone with an SD card slot, or purchasing the S720E 32 GB or S728E.  5. My battery life isn't all that great.  How can I improve it?  For the less adventurous types out there, the easiest way to regain some battery life is to disable unnecessary apps.  HTC and AT&T like to install a bunch of applications that the majority of us simply won't use.  So we call that "bloatware".  To disable the apps, navigate to Settings, Apps, All and select the AT&T or HTC apps you want off.  Force Stop the app, then Disable it.  For those who are computer savvy and have rooted before, I recommend unlocking your bootloader, installing Clockworkmod recovery, and then installing Superuser SU and Root App Delete from the Play store.  These apps will allow you to delete the HTC and AT&T software altogether.  A Permanent fix would be to go one step further and install a custom ROM (operating system) on your phone.  This will give you a clean operating system with no HTC or AT&T apps.  There are tutorials at XDA-Developers forum on how to perform all of these tasks.  To get your phone's bootloader unlocked and start the process, search for "HTC Dev" in your search engine of choice, and you will find HTC's developer website that takes you step by step through the unlock process.  Your bootloader has to be unlocked to install a recovery and root your phone.  6.  My personal thoughts on this phone  My family is very satisfied with these phones.  They are fast, capable, and despite the S-On feature, have adequate storage for our media needs.  The screens are sharp, pictures are fantastic, and keeping up with friends on social media is pleasurable on this phone.  We almost prefer the phones to our desktop computers when it comes to social media.  The battery life is great once rooted and cleaned up.  I love showing them off to my friends with iPhones, because let's face it, they are as capable as the iPhone 4 with the right apps installed and for less money in many cases.  I would recommend them to a friend, pending they take my advice on disabling or removing unnecessary apps.
YAY NEW PHONE!  Now I just have to wait for cricket's takeover by AT&T to hurry along so I can use it on my network. It looks like it's in perfect condition. I'm really excited for this phone. It's supposed to be a music lover's dream.
Samsung Purchase.  I bought this product for a friend abroad and he was totally impressed. It responded to all the tests of the genuine thing. Apparently cheap Samsung" Clones"  do not have widgets. This baby came through with flying colors at half the price. On behalf of my friend- this phone & Seller are the real Deal.
My Favorite Phone EVER!  I bought this as a replacement for my previous Mate 2 that I broke after an awkward drop.  I was heartbroken!  I am a big guy and I need a big phone.  Fat fingers are not an issue with this phone.  Not a lot of bloatware installed either.  Recommend getting a Trident case for protection.  Eventually plan to root it and upgrade to Marshmallow.

Excellent Mobile for Travel  Great phone, only drawback is having to get on-line to access a user manual.  Phone only came with USA charger, would like to have had International charger as well (my other similar phone came with both chargers).

Satisfied owner of unbranded International phone  I have never bought a phone outside a carrier. That and the fact the label said International and No Warranty really had me concern. Not having ATT branding and stuff cluttering my new expensive phone was enticing though. Not having ATT block or delay my phone updates also was interesting. Having a white phone was a small but nice benefit too. So I cancel my ATT purchase and bought from Mercate Group. ATT said it would ship at the end of month, Mercate said I would have my phone by the end of month. Reality was Mercate quickly sent me my phone within a week. Did not have to pay extra for quick shipping either. When I contacted seller about warranty they said they would honor the 1 year warranty. With no sales tax through Amazon I saved $55, got my preferred phone unbranded and unlocked, quicker and cheaper than ATT. Though I must say ATT activated the phone to my GOPhone account quickly and easily with no charge either. So far I am extremely satisfied with everything regarding this purchase. As far as warranty we will have to wait and hope not to need it. Another thing is that the AC charger included has a European plug but an adapter was included, I think by Mercate,
ok

This is a really nice cell phone  This is a really nice cell phone.  I upgraded from a Google Nexus 5x which I liked but I switch phones often (to the point my wife is annoyed) and I also felt like I needed a bigger, brighter screen.  This phone doesn't disappoint in that regard or in overall form factor.  The sound is incredible with the Dolby front facing speakers.  One thing I really like is that despite the buttery smooth Snapdragon 820 processor and a relatively modest 3250 mah battery, the battery drain is slower than other phones I've had (Nexus 5x, Nexus 6, Galaxy S5 etc).  It does seem to take a long time to charge up (about 45-50 minutes to go from 50% to 100%).  There are a lot of customization options such as MyVoice which can unlock the phone using your voice, as well as open apps, and play music.  I've only taken an outdoor picture with the phone and it came out great...actually outstanding.  I've heard it's not great in low light situations so we shall see.  I believe I'm going to roll with Axon 7 well into 2017.  It is a really, really good daily driver.

New I phone for cheap!  I wanted a new iPhone, didn't need all the bells and whistles.  And I didn't want to pay $650.  So I bought this, bought the $99 apple care plus plan directly from Apple and now I'm covered for 2 full years!  I love it!
One of the most complete phone outhere  Good  phone.  Just noticed slight change on swipe prediction since looks to me my gs2 was little bit more accurate in some instances,  although I cannot fully verify this. Better to get this one than att version,  even losing lte.
Great replacement phone for my old lg g3

great  Budget friendly. Worked perfectly abroad. Not the best camera.
Perfect size for me  Great phone. It's not too small or big. The iPhone 5c is the perfect size for my small hands. 16gb is a pretty good size if you are like me and don't really take that many pictures or use that many apps. Have had this phone for about 3 years now and it still works. I got it used/refurbished as well. I will be upgrading to the 5se pretty soon because I don't like the size of the 6 or 6+.

Great phone for my mother-in-law from brazil.
Exceeded my expectations in every possible way.  I LOVE IT.  Best purchase I've made in a while.  Coming from htc one m9 this phone is a HUGE upgrade across the board, even the audio experience is 5x better, which is saying a lot considering that htc one m9 used to be king of audio.  This phone also looks like it was designed by a jewel crafter or watch maker, you have to see it in person to appreciate its beauty.  Super fast and fluid, really nice software touches, instant fingerprint sensor (can store 5 fingers). AMAZING display, this phone easily goes toe to toe with the s7, and in my opinion is a good bit better then LG g5, EASILY BEATS HTC 10, oneplus3, etc.  The s7 is really its only competition, and at this price point there is no comparison.
excelent  Excelent cellphone for a standar user. Had no problems with it. Worth the money paid for it. Buy it worhout doubt.
this phone rocks!  i am so excited that i have finally found the right smart phone for every thing i need and i have tried several!
I enjoy the screen when looking at photos/videos  Works well, battery lasts well although I am not a heavy user. I enjoy the screen when looking at photos/videos, the picture quality is excellent.

One of the best phones i have ever Purchased, very durable lasted me a very long time.
Glad I bought it!  Since information on the Iphone 4S is readily available on the internet, I'll write my review that I am happy with the seller.  It is exactly as advertised.  Unlocked as described.  No damage.  Really it's almost as good as new. As for the Iphone 4S, I like it better than the Iphone 6 - due to it's smaller size.
Excelent cellphone, is working great and is in perfect condition..better that I thought.
It's sooo good.
I cant stop my self on playing this phablet  This thing is a monster in terms of specs..SAMSUNG you nailed it again. My wife has an Iphone5 and yet she envy on this machine when i am with it for hours yet not draining the batteries..This thing is truly invented for humans...

It is amazing! Amazing  this phone is the end all to all phones. It is amazing! Amazing! Dream of doing with a phone this thing does it without me thinking about it. Every time I want to look something up all I have to do is hold the button. On it with awesome beats audio. I would recommend this to anybody. It's a little bit pricey but if you're willing to go with the plan it can become quite affordable. Very large screen with great HD display, and there's a really fast processor inside of it so you don't have to wait for those pesky videos to load.
Great phone , great seller experience!  I received the phone before the estimated delivery date. It was exactly what I expected to receive based on the description listed. My only issue with the phone is the battery life even while in power saver mode, it really burns through the power! To the phone's credit,  I've been using it far more often than usual while trying to get a feel for it. All in all,  great purchase!
I love this phone!! Very durable
It was great  I love my nokia lumia, it is great, the only problem is that I can't send messages like *100#Ok but as I understood it was windows phone-s issue, anyway I would reccomend it and the seller (Wireless Extra) P.S Sorry for my bad English
Nice phone for the price  Good phone and came unlocked
Was exactly as described and i have not complaints whatsover, delivery was also speedy
spen is the difference  spen makes this phablet whithout competitors
Great Smartphone!!!  I'm so glad to have this phone. Is smooth and faster than any other that I've had. The camera works quite good, I don't know why some people are saying that is "just fine". I totally recommended if you are looking for a faster, always up to date Android Smartphone.
I buy this phone for a friend and he love it perfect.

As promised boxed and unlocked.
Great Phone only topped by the Motorola Droid Turbo.  I do not own a galaxy note 4 but have played around with it at the Verizon store and a friend of mine who got the phone (who hates that the droid turbo came out shortly after he bought it).  The phone is great and up there with the google nexus 6.  The only phone better is the Motorola Droid Turbo; all things considered no phone can top the Droid Turbo.  Personally I find the size of the note 4 to be too big for a smartphone just like the Iphone 6 plus.  But that's just my opinion.  Definitely one of the best phones out there and I rate it 5/5
All good  Perfect. Put sim card in, immediately worked.
Nexus is the way to go.  Great and works with Project Fi.
excelente  buenas noches la compra todo fue muy rapido y sin ningun problama y en excelentes condiciones y llego a tiempo gracias
So far going great. Had it couple months and very pleased
Positive experience!
Almost Tractor Proof  I am posting this from my e980 which I just ran over with a 5 ton tractor. Needless to say, I love it. It has gone for swims and been dropped from absurd heights, and survives it all, with a quick replacement of the digitizer.

Smartphone? It's more like Geniusphone!!  There's no way around it: the Galaxy Note is the best phone you can get right now. It leads everybody in inches and pixels, is up there in terms of storage (save for the Iphone, but with the benefit of micro-SD storage), has a top of line processor, the standard day long battery life (which is a reach for many top of line Android devices, especially the beautifully built HTC line), and Samsung's signature plastic yet solid built. The camera, while not the best out there, is far superior to the Nexus' (which, remember, doesn't support micro-SD). The only way around it is not considering it a phone, but let's be honest here: it would be silly (if not moronic) to carry the Note AND a phone around; it fits (if barely) a pocket, it makes calls without a earpiece, so it's a phone. While I'm not particulary found of tablets, I do love smartphones, and I took the leap of faith to buy the huge "phablet" Note for phone only use. But really, make no mistake, it's a big phone, NOT a small tablet. And boy did a make a good choice. The screen is absolutely stellar to the point of putting my old HTC Deside HD to shame; there's no way to come back to the tiny 4.3 non-HD screen. It's funny how the once considered huge 4.3 screen has been dwarfed by the Note's. The performance is top-notch by any standart as it handles every task you throw it's way. And there's no complaint whatsoever about handling the big device. So much is said about the difficult one-hand use of the phone; well, it's a good thing then that I happen to have two of them! The lone problem for me is that I preferred to carry my old phone in the shirt pocket, but using the pants pocket is just fine. Granted, the Note doesn't ship with Ice Cream Sandwich, but it's a safe bet it won't take long for Samsung to upgrade the operational sistem. In short, there's no better Android option around, and I can guarantee you'll get used to the size of the device if you keep an open mind and care about quality and performance. As for the Iphone, you may get a better camera and more storage, but really, it's like comparing a Hyundai Sonata with a Fiat 500 (I live in Brazil; don't blame me, that's what I have here to compare). Remember when the Iphone's 3.5 screen was considered too big, four years ago? Me neither.

Keeper!  Great phone! Worked fine with pre-paid plan (Straight Talk...just get their SIM card and call them to set it up...their web site is erratic). Perfect size and nice extra Samsung features...so far so good!!!
Sold as unlocked. Far as I can tell, not the case. I have a pending message with the seller.  We'll see.
I use this as my backup phone. It works very well though it sometimes runs slowly. But it is to be expected for the price point.
Love the phone  Love the phone.  Dual SIM was easy to set up& I could get down to one phone but kept my work and personal cell numbers.  Not commonly used in the USA but was a perfect solution for me.  Thank goodness for Amazon!!

Google Nexsus 5 Unlocked  Great phone and service from company.  the only minor negative is the placement of the on and off button.  I use a pouch and taking it out turns the phone one.  Maybe this is a good thing I don't know.

Can you use this with cricket
excelent thank you.
Great phone  I had an S5 which I lost.  I prefer this- metal case plus 3 physical buttons at the bottom.  Feels rugged.
Perfect phone  Got it from Mobile Front. Perfect phone in each way. I had a G2 previously and jumped to this, no more lagging on high quality games or video editing (most ram an processor demanding tasks) not at all. Came perfectly new with temporary protector films all over the device, the battery life is excellent and the screen has outstanding looks on graphics.
I am enjoying it.
my wife loves it.
Excellent
nice
i mean the outside screen please. The phone still works but fine it harmful to swipe my fingers on a broken screen.
Samsung galaxy done right  Absolutely in love with my Samsung galaxy s7. The phone lasts for a long time compared to most phones and it fits comfortably on one hand. This is similar to the iphones such as the fingerprint unlocking is pressed down like the iphones. Also to get the sim card and the SD card out you need a pin just like the iphones. The SD card allows the phone to hold more space than the 32GB that is included in the phone. Also this phone is pretty slim unlike my former Samsung Note 4.

Great service, phone is just what I wanted.
Quality mid range Samsung phone!  In the U.S. this phone is available through Cricket and runs off Att towers.  You can purchase it from cricket right now for 129.00.  I love this phone!  It is right in my price range (150-200 bucks).  It is still fairly new,  I believe it was released in Nov 2014 and unfortunately it did not come with the 5.0 Lollipop operating system,  it runs off Android 4.4 Kitkat but it navigates and responds quickly.  There have been rumors that it will eventually get a Lollipop update but that is not for certain.  This phone does not have all the bells and whistles of a Samsung Galaxy 5 or 6 but it is still a sharp phone for being under 150.00.  This camera takes pretty sharp and colorful pix with it's 8 megapixel camera and 5 megapixel front facing camera with LED flash and 1080p HD video recording available. You have to go to camera setting to make the camera 8 megapixel as it is pre-set at 6 megapixel out of the box.  The camera is probably the Grand Prime's strong point as it gives you several options and settings you usually would find with a more high end Galaxy phone.  Apps run well on this phone with minimal freezing or crashing and it operates very smoothly!  One reason I can't give the Grand Prime 5 stars is because the internal memory is very small!  It says 8 GB of internal memory but after you activate your phone you only end up with about 4.5 GB of internal memory so make sure you buy an SD card to add to it (up to 64 GB) and move your downloaded apps to your SD card if it allows you to.  Speaker volume is good on this phone but could be a little louder.  Another strong point is the battery.  The battery life of this phone is outstanding!!  Adjusting the power settings makes it last even longer!  Many times I have held a 100% charge for almost 2 hours even after making calls or opening a few apps.  If you are really a fanatic about conserving your battery,  another smart feature of this phone is the 'Ultra power saving mode' that helps your battery achieve the longest life possible. The GPS works flawlessly as well.  For the money I paid,  I love this phone and think it was a smart buy!  However if you are a big tech geek and gadgets type person you might prefer a phone with a bit more features.  *UPDATE*  Cricket fans rejoice!!!  The Android Lollipop 5.1 update is finally being released in the US!  I received mine Dec 1, 2015.  So if you haven't received your's yet it's coming!  PROS  -Sturdy built,  slim design -Sharp 8 megapixel camera with tons of camera options and settings -1080p video recording -As of Dec 2015 most Grand Prime phones should receive the Lollipop 5.1.1 update -Long lasting battery -Speaker sound is good  CONS  -Just 8 GB of internal memory (but more like 4.5 GB).  You definitely will need an external SD card with this phone. -Not a whole lot of fancy features compared to higher end Galaxy phones.
I recommend to you 100%
Very good product  Very nice phone though I'm suspicious of the fact that it wasn't brand new as sauce cus I try to open some apps and they say someone's using it on a different device
Great  I love the display of this phone, it runs everything smooth nothing to complain It works fine in Argentina
Fantastic phone  I purchased it used by Cleartronix. The phone is in like new condition. Never be happier.  I've owned the Moto G 2013, Moto G 2014, Lg G3, Lg G4, and Sony Xperia Z3. The G2 is one of the best looking and best phones overall, even though I only use it as a backup while waiting for the Z5. The reason why I choose the G2 over those phones is because it has great battery life (which the G3 and G4 lack), good looking, better screen-body ratio, is more comfortable to hold, and cheaper. Everything in the G2 is fantastic except it doesn't offer expendable storage, but 32gb is enough for me considering it's a backup phone.
Exelente

My son love it.
No WARRANTY !!! (updated)  661$ for what ??? I paid 25$ extra for the one with the International Warranty . I paid another extra 15$ by buying it from Amazon.com not from the other retail sellers as I didn't want to get frustrated. Well, here we go, I opened the package and saw there was no seal on the box. The phone had dirt all over it. And the biggest problem : there was no WARRANTY documents ... I am so much frustrated and angry right now. Filed a claim and sent the package back. I'll see what happens next as I still want to have this AMAZING phone !!!  update : I did get my money back and got another one with warranty and I am way more happy with it since then. It is an incredible phone, way better than so called Iphone 4 and 4s. Recommend it to all !!
Make sure you have decent coverage for whatever network you plan to use.

Excellent phone!!  I love LG G4, excellent phone especially I can switch batteries easly, I have 3 backup batteries, Now LG messed everything up going with a sealed phone just to copycat Iphone and Samsung, I don't need a phone for swimming or taking pictures underwater that's why I have a waterproof camera, but sooner or later my LG G4 phone will go obsoleted due to software updates, you notice that when you have a old phone and you try to download an app it will say that this app isn't support by your phone, that's the reason phones manufacturers keep updating phone's software they don't want us to keep a phone for ever, LG G4 it's amazing phone no doubt about it
I was fascinated by my easy phone to use various applications  I was fascinated by my easy phone to use various applications, very nice design and size suitable for those who do not like us extravagance. The only thing that disgut me is that not bring headphones. But has both positive and disgust that step. Truly recommend Excellent Excellent phone for price.

WoW..... Blew my mind  (Buy this at BestBuy which they will match the price of 350 and throw in 50 gift card right now or buy from newegg for 350 and they will throw in JBL headphone.) I usually don't write reviews but I feel like this phone deserve a lot of recognition.  Before I start  I want to inform the readers that Ive never bought "budget" phone before.  Coming from galaxy s7 edge and prior to that I had LG v10 and iPhone. I purchased this phone for 300 dollars if you include 50 dollar from BestBuy.  Seriously for only 300 dollar you are getting exceptional phone.  It has the same SD820 CPU and adreno 530GPU and AMOLED screen as galaxy s7 edge. I've compares them side by side and this screen gets brighter than gs7e. Even though it's packing the same hardware its faster.  I'm assuming it's because of EmUI is less bloated than touchwiz by Samsung.  The spec listed that you can upgrade up to 128gb of external memory but Ive put in my 200gb micro SD and it works flawlessly. The button placement is all on the right side where it's most comfortable so if you are viewing it horizontally you won't have accidental button push to turn off the screen.  Also the headphone Jack is up at the top where it should be. Finger print scanner is instantaneous without having to depress the button. Front facing speaker is crystal clear with loud bass.  Hands down best phone speaker. Better than nexus 6p and HTC. Speaking of HTC, this phones design KS reminiscent of previous HTC models.  Except it has 5.5in AMOLED display and has nice curvature to form nicely in your hand. Easily capable of one hand operation unlike iPhone plus series. Of course this phone isn't perfect.  As other reviewers have mentioned, camera is mediocre. Us it has 20mp rear facing camera and 8mp camera in front but the spec don't tell the whole truth.  It definitely struggles in low light and photos are sometimes grainy.  Galaxy is the benchmark of smartphone camera.  Also capacity buttons are just little bit too close and it doesn't illuminate. But you will get used to it after some usage. You don't need illumination to know where those buttons are. Some people are just nit picking. I mean for 350 dollar and gift card or headphone you can't go wrong with this phone.  It does so many things right couple of deficiency is not problematic.  So all in all, I would recommend this phone.  5stars!!!!

Great phone  I am so excited about this phone. It's my first upgrade since the  S4.
Glad I did  I really thought I could never find another 1020. Glad I did. Good price too. Sorry to see Nokia meet an untimely fate with Windows.
I ordered my galaxy note 3 after using my galaxy note 2 for 2 years, it is working amazing. Very pleased about the upgrade and about quality of the phone. I got also a very secure hard case because in the previous one the case was very slim and it did not protected it well.
It was a good shop. Everything was good
Great!

Great phone!  I was afraid to buy a used IPhone but relieved to receive a phone that was in excellent condition (no scratches), everything works,  and was easy to activate. Most cel phones use a bigger SIM card and all I needed to do was walk into my cel phone carrier 's store and they had a custom SIM card cutter, put it in,and I was in business!!

Samsung Galaxy 3 mini - excellent phone  Coming from a phone with a physical qwerty, I found this to be a big change. The phone was light and slim, it also had a very bright and crisp screen. The display of the regular S3 is better, but this phone more than meets my needs as a not-compulsive cell phone user. I mainly text and send email, occasionally use navigation and sometimes use the data like if I need store hours or to find an ATM. First thing was to change the language as my phone was international - but it was a breeze. It read my T-Mo SIM card with no problems, synced up my contacts via gmail and them synched up my bookmarks via chrome and danngggg I was on my way to being a Samsung fan.
The cell phone arrived faster than expected. Works very. Fits my pocket, convenient to carry around at work. Sim cards slots a little too small for T-Mobile card but They managed to cut and insert.
Unbelievably Easy to Use.  This phone is great! Lots of features and Apps. It came on time, unlocked and ready to use here in Mexico. I took the Sim card from my iPhone 4s and inserted it along with a 64 GB SD card and turned on the phone and it has worked flawlessly on the Telcel network.  Amazon did a great job.  The only phone for me!
Samsung Galaxy Ace Exelente Producto  Excelente producto muy completo y de facil manejo, en Venezuela aplica a la telefonia Movilnet sin problemas. Lo recomiendo 100%
Great Service  Excellent Service from GSM Wholesale. My first device was defective, and they went to great lengths to ensure I received another one in working condition. Best outfit I've dealt with on Amazon.
awesome
LOVE!  LOVE this phone! I'm definitely more of an android person than an iPhone person.  The screen is so big, and it is not nearly as fragile as the iPhone!
Cool   This phone is good although its not the best for watching videos or movies because of the screen resolution but it runs apps pretty smoothly.
Great Phone  Love the phone large screen works great

It works with Movistar Venezuela! (Funciona con Movistar Venezuela). It's totally brand new! Has great battery life (it used it the first day a loooot and lasted all day). Has great performance and it's a great fit for my hand (I don't like oversized phones). It has a great camera. Also it updated itself to lollipop when I turned it on for the first time! I LOVE THIS PHONE!
Excelente phone , thanks.
The phone is AWESOME!!  people said all sorts of things about the phone that made me regret buying, but that was before i used mine. When i looked at the box of the phone, it said US sim cards only and i was devastated. When I put my Zambian Simcards, the opposite happened. The phone is AWESOME!!!!!
Excelente...

5 Starts  Good product, even better than the description.

Does it need wifi  Can the ipod be used without wifi?
My dad loves it
I am pleased I took the plunge  I bought this Phablet 1 years ago, looking for an alternative to having to carry a Tablet and a Smartphone everywhere (both for practical and for security reasons, since I owned an iPad 2 and a Sony Ericcson smartphone at the time). When I 1st considered getting such a large smartphone (remember, this is the father of all Phablet devices, and back then most people thought having such a big device was ridiculous) I had my reservations... But today, I am pleased I took the plunge. Now I am a Phablet Lover, and I think I would hardly go back to a phone with less than a 5 inch screen, and it started with the Galaxy Note 1.  After a year with the Note 1, I gave it to my father (his had been stolen) and made the switch to iPhone 5... after 4 months with it, I felt so....LIMITED... I gave it to my sister  and bought the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, which I currently own.  After 3 years of use, the Galaxy Note 1, still in my father's possession, has proved to be remarkably durable and trustworthy.
Great phone for the money.
exelent
Great phone  The phone works great. Just like advertised. No issues with installing apps, setting it up. We use it for straight talk.
Great item!
Best phone on the market
I love this phone!  The phone is awesome, quick and responsive and all Google for ease of operation.  The camera works fine for me.  If you're a sprint customer, call around for a sim card, first. Finding a sim card took several calls and a 20 mile drive.
Such a incredible cellphone, as well as the descriptions
I love my phone
What a great deal! Fully functional phone  What a great deal! Fully functional phone, enough guts for most uses, although I'm not a video-heavy user, so I can't comment on that. Pop in a large storage card and every so often migrate as much app storage to the card as you can, and this phone should last quite a while. Good compact size. The battery isn't huge, but its modular nature means you can buy another one and keep a fully charged backup around for more extreme adventures.
it's big 
excellent produt  excellent product. was received at the indicated time and without any difficulty, as based on the place of purchase. recommended one product
