Disappointed...but not surprised  I read a few reviews that were poor and stated that the machine could not updates Windows 8, but most of the reviews were positive and this seemed to be the best bang for the buck in my son's price range so we ordered it and hoped for the best. He was ecstatic to have his first laptop all to himself. We got it set up and did all the updates. Now it doesn't work. It says..."Failed to updated Windows. Reverting updates. Do not turn off computer" and just gets stuck there. Has anyone successfully resolved this issue? I'm sending it back to Amazon tomorrow but I'm still deciding whether to order the same computer and hope for a better result or order something else. It seemed like a fine computer otherwise.
Sending it back  What a disappointment. Machine is terribly slow (my computer guy says this is probably because it is a refurb). Specs say battery power up to 4.25 hours, but fully charged it tells you it is only good for 2.5 and I think that is better than it really gets. Keyboard has strange uncomfortable spacing and touch pad is difficult to use. All in all, much less machine than the 4 year old HP laptop it was supposed to replace. It is going back.
Windows has expired when it says it comes with it  I just received my computer and it say that windows has expired when in the details it said it was good???
Started day one of my new laptop with issues powering on, or staying on for more than a few minutes, days of trouble-shooting and it will only operate in certain power saver modes. Now, well it works, sort of, can't really load videos or games reliably, at least if you aren't willing to wait forever and refresh often. Tons of troubleshooting and no real help. Also, make sure you read the warranty and amazon return policy. You cannot exchange, bought it for a deal, now, while it should have out-performed my desktop it crawls at a slower pace than my 2008 laptop and well, I am stuck with it.
Laptop won't open, Hoorah... =.= Forget booting up, power button doesn't even work...
A piece of junk . Period!
Awful product matched by awful customer service!  Awful. Awful. Awful. So painfully slow. Will not even use it. Hate it. And Dell's customer services matches this horrible product with terrible customer service. Have been transferred to 17 people trying to resolve an issue and have spend 6 hours so far. Still no help and no resolution. So upset!
Not DOA but on full life support  I bought this for a friend whose key requirement was portability, not performance. Even with performance in the back seat, I elected to go with a Celeron based machine as I was concerned an Atom based one lacked the minimum horsepower to make a user happy. The computer showed up with the usual prompt Amazon delivery and seemed in good condition on arrival. That's the last of the "good" statements you'll see. During the initial power up, the machine autonomously shut down. I hadn't paid too much attention up until that time as my friend was certainly capable of running through the new user initialization screens. After a second shutdown, I became more involved. It made it through to the desktop on the third try and I assumed it was some sort of learning curve issue until it instantly closed out of Windows 8 while doing essentially nothing. At this time, it wouldn't even boot properly and shutdown before hitting the windows screen. The second attempt brought up a screen asking about whether to try correcting Windows. Figuring there was certainly something wrong, it seemed reasonable to say, "Yes" and it went though it's correction routines. We were then able to get it to boot properly. Again I made the assumption the problems were Windows based and transient in nature. After downloading Skype, I was talking to my son when the machine shut off, instantly. Like the other times, this wasn't an orderly shutdown but rather as if someone had just pulled the plug (yes, this is a laptop but you get the drift. For what it's worth, the configuration for the first couple of boot attempts were on the battery which was fully charged but after that, I  plugged the machine in to ensure there wasn't some sort of battery issue). We did another start and this time it stayed up for about 15 minutes. Two more shutdowns and I hit the Amazon return button.  I wanted to like this machine because if it had worked, it would have been an ideal machine for its intended use. The screen was certainly adequate and while the keyboard was small for my hands, I'm sure a person could get used to touch typing on it. Two USB ports allowed me to hook a portable DVD drive to it and it read and installed software fine. Unfortunately, there was a quality (or design) problem. I did an internet search for Windows 8 autonomous shutdowns and didn't find any results so it appears to be on the hardware side. When I ordered I was concerned about Acer quality and in this instance, it appears they cut one too many corners and lost a sale. It's difficult to objectively rate a computer that arrives with a hardware problem. Without the problem I encountered, it might be a great machine so giving a one star rating based on an obviously defective machine is a bit harsh. I'm sure this isn't the typical computer but I felt I couldn't rate it higher than two stars because even though it had potential, Acer quality control wasn't up to preventing defective machines from making it to end users and any buyer needs to be aware of this.
Disappointing.  Setup only took about 20 minutes. Not bad. Unfortunately, that was the only thing that was positive about this. I tried to go with the Windows 10 upgrade. After 3 hours, the download part had only progressed about 25%. I stopped the download, and went ahead with my regular light web browsing. Visiting different websites for homework was mediocre at best, and I had good Wireless strength. A couple of days later, I got back on it for more browsing, and even simple websites such as Google loaded at the speed of dial-up. Not to mention that the computer and its programs had went unresponsive several times. This evening, I started it back up. Boottime was excellent. I put in my password to my Microsoft account, and I sat watching the spinning dot-wheel thing, and all that I saw was "Welcome" for several minutes. It never booted into the start menu. I packed it up and have asked Amazon for a refund after only one week. A total waste of $300, but at least I'm getting it back. My tip to anyone who considers buying this is, don't be cheap. Spend a couple hundred extra, and you probably won't be disappointed. In this case, I definitely got what I paid for, and that is the most expensive paperweight.
Not what I expected.  The slide screen is constantly moving when you are trying to type something it is always going back to the home screen causing me to start all over again. It will jump to your pictures out of the blue . very unstable.
... excited because of its specs to only be very disappointed with the panel it comes with  I received the laptop today and was so excited because of its specs to only be very disappointed with the panel it comes with.  It seems very fast but it is unbelievable that for this amount of money, the panel has a lot of texturing/cloudiness when viewing whites and greys in it probably due to the touch screen.  I ordered an Asus Zenbook Pro UX501 weeks ago and returned it for the same reason.  I ordered an Asus Zenbook UX303ub from Amazon and it came from Upgrade Kings that has 20Gb of ram, a 512Gb ssd and 2Gb graphics card.  The processor in the Zenbook is only a dual core and the graphics card in it is nowhere near the performance of the 970m that comes in the Razer, but value wise, the Zenbook beats it hands down.  The Zenbook is opening applications faster than the Razer which isn't that important but that shouldn't happen either. And what amazes me is for so much less money, the panel on the Zenbook is way better than the Razer which is why I am holding on to the Zenbook.  What a deal breaker...Razer needs to get their act together and upgrade their panels as I have read they are a couple of years old now.  I am sending it back tomorrow and waiting for the Macbook Pro to come out in the fall because I can count on them to have an incredible panel....my 15" 2015 Macbook pro with lower screen resolution was much better than the one that comes in the Razer and spent close to the amount of money on my MBP that I did on the Razer.  Nobody makes panels as well as Apple..not even Dell.  I just don't get what the big deal is with the Razer now and will probably never consider one again.
Not to happy  It worked for like a week an started messing up and freezing. Wouldn't even let me on the internet. I didn't do nothing to it but try to use it. I was a little disappointed.
Hard drive problems  I got one of these to take on a trip, during which the machine limped along with a specific problem -- after a random amount of time running, anywhere from 30 seconds to about an hour, it would freeze and reboot. This would always happen with the hard drive light stuck on, making me think the problem was with the hard drive. When I got back, I returned it to Amazon for a replacement. That came quickly and at first seemed fine. Great in fact. I liked the keyboard, I like Windows 7, the machine feels pretty nippy. It wakes up very quickly and is really small and lightweight. Then after two days it too developed a hard drive problem. This time it wouldn't boot at all. I returned it to Amazon for a full refund. Amazon's processing of returns was great. In my experience, the unreliable hard drives Toshiba uses sabotage this otherwise excellent product.  One more gripe, though this isn't specific to the Toshiba Mini - Windows 7 starter edition, which is the operating system that comes with this laptop, doesn't let you set your own desktop background. The desktop you get has a big Microsoft Windows logo. The software is intentionally nobbled so you can't change it. I find that pretty offensive.
DO NOT BUY IT.  Had it since late 2014. Quite a powerful machine, loved most of it except the seemingly flimsy build. It ran very smoothly, exceptionally well actually, till about 2 days ago when it just went off and won't come back on again. This is despite checking the charger and the battery which seem to be OK. A bit of research over the internet shows that the motherboards for the HP Envy line of laptops have a knack for malfunctioning or plain going dead with the only option being replacement (this is a gamble).  I've had laptops that have lasted over 5 years with no problems. This one, while quite powerful, has lasted me less than 2 years, and it has left me quite disappointed. I would therefore not recommend it for purchase, unless one has a less than 2 year turn over goal for their machines.
Good for a few weeks. Then goes dead.  This computer worked for a few weeks. But slowed down and stopped working last week. I tried to use the recovery system. But that only made it worse. I had to purchase a copy of windows to get this computer to start working
Don't use amazon for this computer  <div id="video-block-R1ZU786HGEI3AF" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/917nIfItmNS.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CBug6fidS.png" class="video-slate-img-url">&nbsp;Wish it would be negative 5 stars. I'm writing a bad review because of Amazon not the computer itself. When I received my computer the picture was going in and out and the best way to describe it is an epileptic nightmare. I take it to geek squad and they tell me that it was a problem with the motherboard. So how exactly is a brand new computer system already have problems and now I have to return it.
Terrible product  I bought an averatec computer and within 4 months it crashed. The customer service reps are not helpful in the least bit, I believe they haven't a clue about computers. I would not recommend this product to anyone who wants a reliable computer.
this laptop lacks a cd/dvd drive  No where is it listed that this machine did NOT come with a cd/dvd drive.  I wouldn't have purchased it if I has known that.
and it has trouble finding wifi when other laptops are just fine. Avoid  The bloatware removal is absolutely mandatory to make it work. Sadly, it does not meet the hardware requirement to install Windows 10. Also, the wireless card does not work well, and it has trouble finding wifi when other laptops are just fine. Avoid.
Windows 10 Home was pre-installed - but was not activated. Laptop would not update due to not being activated, may not be a legal copy of windows 10 provided with item.  Clean install required with new windows disc will be required to fix this issue. .  would not recommend purchasing from this seller due to this
Don't buy Lenovo  I very disappoint from this laptop. Its made from very cheap everything! Keyboard: The keyboard is not pleasant to work with. Anything that fall inside the keyboard even small dust, stop the key. Bezel: Many part of the bezel made from very cheap plastic. This is a laptop, and while traveling, the plastic breaks apart. Parts: After 4 months of using, the HD is dead! Service: the service is terrible as the laptop. 2 months to replace the HD! This is a true story!
Laptop arrived dead---never powered up :-(  The laptop never powered-up. Trying to get it resolved through a local authorized dealer.
Problem with the MousePad  I've had this computer for 6 months. The system works well, but the mousepad is a disaster and makes all use of it frustrating.  It's not responsive - I have to press the left-click button 1-3 times to get it to work.  It is also not an ergonomic key pad.  Think about this before you buy, the buttons are ineffective, and positioned for elf hands - I've never had hand strain in 15 years of computing until this HP! My wife's Dell is the opposite - easy buttons and ergonomic.  I only use my HP with a different mouse in the USB port.   It has shut down once or twice for no reason, and sometimes won't start without pressing the "reset" button, but otherwise it's been smooth riding with the system itself.
it's not a serious store
Would not recommend this to anyone  Didn't take a charge right out of the box, awful product. Would not recommend this to anyone. Stay away from this.
Crashed after three months  After installing Windows 8.1, the computers hard drive crashed and would not reboot. Dell is going to replace the hard drive or the whole thing for me, but I lost some of my work. It will take 7-10 business days to receive my replacement laptop. I like the Toshiba that I have had for years better than the Dell.
Acer Laptop Screen quit working Twice within First Year  The screen quit working after only 4 months.  They "fixed" it.  Then it quit working again after only 4 more months.  It costs you a ton of money and time to have to ship for repair poor quality products that break so quickly..  Think twice before buying an Acer.
Six months of Despair  This laptop, with the Microsoft operating system is awful!!!!  Pictures won't download, printer won't install, the screens flash on and off. Always restarts. Errors... Very upset, wish I could return it, but it is too late.
Avoid Until Dell Fixes Their Issues  The issue I have is that you have to restart your computer to have the internet browser working. After spending hours with Dell support they are not able to solve the problem. The laptop has the latest drivers and diagnostic checks. Seems like Dell released a bad product.
nice computer but it has issues.  Purchased December 2011.  Reviewed July 2012 This is a nice speedy computer, but there is an issue with the power connector on the PC.  Something went wrong and it fried the power adapter.  Bought a new power adapter and it fried that one too.  Now Asus has had it for over a week and no ETA for repairs to be complete.
Chrome is a toy, not serious business or even play  If you don't work & don't play hard - this "computer" (toy) is for you. But I feel sorry for you, folks. I'd rather swim in Tuxedo, than pretend that ChromeOS is a working OS, Chrome browser is a real WebBrowser, and Gmail can be employed for professional/business use.  I love Goodle for their core product - search Internet & Global Maps/Positioning, but to pretend Chrome toy is a business OS or serious home OS - is a fallacy. I am the one, by the way, who wrote to Google when it was still a few engineers within Yahoo's research division, back in 1996 or 1998 (been long time, don't remember exactly) to keep search's GUI simple versus bloated at that time and still now Yhaoo's interface, they listened, thanks, that's why Google is so sleek search-wise. But PLEASE don't tell me this ChromeBook or ChromeOS, Chrome Browser, Chrome this & that - is a serious product.  It is a toy. If you're a kid or 90 years old and only care for primitive "letterz & stuff..." - this tiy is for you.  YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOE.  If you pay for..... you get .... back (I can't type some words in a public domain)  For anyone with serious needs, please analyze what can industry do for you for $250-300, no much. If you want to be cheap, light, ultraportable, and STILL a "real" Netbook - a better deal is I got a $500 HP DM1Z with Windows7, Intel SSD 240MB enterprize edition or similar (?), AMD APU-based (not ARM) E-1800, the system runs for 9+hours on a single charge, weighs nothing, thin like Mac Air, not a full sized laptop but way better than ChromeBook. I ended up EVEN running Adobe Photoshop on it with not too bad results, its main strength is discrete-class video yet physically built into APU (CPU with Video). It costs mere $230 more than this toyful ChromeBook.  I mean, if you go for ChromeBook, why not pretend your Android SmartPhone is a laptop too - just connect external display via Miracast protocol, keyboard/mouse via WiFi and enjoy your "clever savings" - it saves a whopping $200 over a real laptop with Windows or Linux ============================================================================  UPDATE (10Feb2014): I WISH TO POINT OUT: The repeated mentioning of "Chromebook.. boots instantly" is no more instantly than my multiple machines with Intel SSD as boot device +AND (important) proper management of startup processes! On your Windows machine, do following: boot, wait 5 minutes, rightclick on taskbar-->TaskManager-->Processes, read bottom/statusbar, how many do you have running for all users? I bet a huge number!  My count is: 21 TWENTY ONE processes is all I allow to load. People complaining on Windows booting forever or say for 10 minutes, did not manage the rubbish they allow to loadup/startup, ya'll have those "useful" utilities loading from Adobe autoupdate to windows autoupdate to audio enhancements to lame AOL or another messenger and a pile of others taking precious processing time to load and maintain in memory RESIDENT. +PLUS Many of you complaining on Windows, allow Antiirus+AntiSpyware programs run at all times (real-time), but how come I've never been infected at home & yet no Antivirus/AntiSpyware is easting away CPU/memory/diskIO cycles here? My Windows machines boot like a solidstate device, well in fact they boot off Intel SSD's, but I emphasize it is NOT merely SSD or whatever bootdevice, it is the absence of myriad useless memory hogs loading at startup, which most of you allow.
SSDD  Do NOT buy this.  Mine worked well for a month or so and then all of a sudden started freezing and crashing multiple times per HOUR!!! I found out I was not alone.  I found all kinds of other people with the same problem or worse.  It is now 2 months old and I cannot return it.  I will talk with Acer. Just google Chromebook support page and have a good read at our expense.
Net Flix stopped Streaming, I tried to Return/Exchange but policy prohibits
horrible!  did not work.. wifi would not connect and could not update drivers from website because of a update.ccp 1203 error
Defective product, did not look new, bad packaging.  The battery was not charging. Computer had scratches and stains. The packaging boxes were filled with dirty old newspaper pieces and looked like junk. Had to return it back.
NO DVD drive  I was very disappointed to learn that this Asus laptop does not actually include a DVD drive, despite advertisements stating so, both by Asus and Amazon." There is NO DVD drive in this model
We were told it wasn't an issue and would work fine. That is great  We record this in and set this laptop up at a local computer store. We noticed right away the paper light didn't stay lit.  We were told it wasn't an issue and would work fine.  That is great, however, 7 months in and the power cord doesn't work, it can't be detected so now we can't charge the laptop. I can't find anyone to help with this either. Not happy with my purchase like this from amazon.  I would recommend going to a computer store where you can get the help needed, especially when it's under warranty.
Don't get it sucks.  This iRULU broke down after two times of turning it on, and now I cant return it because Its too late. Don't get it sucks.
Junk that worked great until it didn't  Failed motherboard about 1 month after warranty. Until then it was great, and I was amazed at the handwriting recognition capability of Windows on this product. Perhaps the new generation will be much more capable. This thing ran fairly hot (thermally) and I think the inability to manage that heat was the problem/
does not work  I took it to the Geek squad  at Best Buy,to transfer info from another mac,  they said it was faulty, they even sent it to their factory and didn't have the part to fix it,,so bought one fron eBay.
slow pc  Slowest PC I have ever owned. I gave it away and bought a good one.
It works but a let down from prior experience  Had it for some weeks now. Not impressed. I liked my old model of a ROG Asus that I bought as a refurb from newegg for the same price (I paid $979 for *this* model; the price now is ridiculous) a few years ago. Wanted an updated replacement that was also more portable for school (old ROG was a 17"). So while this laptop manages to work, it does a sloppy job. Has an oddly difficult time PLAYING SOUND. How does that even..? For example, I play a video on youtube and it takes a whole minute for the sound to turn on. I thought maybe it was just a weird little hiccup back when I began to use it, but no, it really is faulty like that. It also has a loud fan, not obnoxious, but why are the fans on full throttle when, again, all I'm doing is streaming a video?  I am also very unhappy with the software that was included. Windows 8 was a pain as it is (bearable now), but then there's also all the Asusware, half of which is mediocre. (Plus additional bloatware like McAfee). Also when you name your optical drive playing software as movie magic, or whatever, it makes it sound like a video editing program. And then nothing, NOTHING you do can re-install this, not even factory settings. You have to dl something else. Asus customer service will tell you they don't *have the ability to replace software from their own company*. Okay, that's not difficult, but better customer service please. Pay attention to what customers who don't stop at newegg say. We are customers as well.  Overall, I knew I was going to win some and lose some by shelling out money for a smaller laptop. But for a few dollars away from a grand, it feels like a rip off. I liked Asus so much prior to this experience. My old ROG still functions, but again, it's a 17" and the updated screen on *this* model does look great (except for when you open anything other than a browser or windows program, e.g. Steam app. Then, more likely it isn't optimized for the sharp crisp look that is the IPS display so it looks like crap). While it doesn't concern me ATM, you DO want that SSD. I'm not a computer geek by any means, but I do my research as a consumer, and it is disappointing that a) this is more expensive here on amazon as of date and b) this is one of the better options out there in terms of its overall features for the price range. I mean, it shouldn't be, but it is and that is frustrating.  Anyway, I should reiterate, this laptop works fine, except for that strange audio glitch (which, you know, is pathetic since they hype up the sound engineering). The screen is very sharp. The machine is very portable. Games run well (I did Bioshock for a bit. Can't say for newer games. I don't recommend that. I am a sporadic gamer. The games run well and looks good and that's good enough for me). I suppose you should buy it if the context is the same: want a pretty update, something that works, is portable and plays games. Don't if you can wait and keep saving for a better packaged deal.
Will fail on you  The trackpad stopped working in the middle of a work trip 35 days after I bought the machine.
-  The laptop promptly arrived, looked and felt fantastic and if it worked as it should have, I'd have given it 5 stars but sadly it's performance deteriorated within 8 months of purchase under normal use. Here was my experience with this computer  Pros: - The computer display is gorgeous and the native windows scaling works well. - The SLI performance is decent enough to run the Division at medium settings, 40fps, 1080p mode. Most games that support SLI work and play well when scaled down to 1080p at Max settings. - Ability to turn off SLI for games that don't support it. - A very respectable 2.5h battery life for a gaming computer. - The comptuer is insanely fast with generic tasks.  Cons: - The 3K resolution doesn't work well with gaming. Games that even support SLI struggle to run at a playable 30fps at native resolution on medium - high settings. I found myself constantly scaling back to 1080p fullscreen mode all the time to play games with any degree of smoothness. - WiFi connectivity is extremely poor and there is little that can fix it. Essentially this laptop recieves signals up to ~5m away from any wifi router I've used either at home, or university. The connection speed dropoff was exponential as well. All other devices on the same networks performed just fine. - The microphone is atrocious. Seriously, I tried recording a lecture with it and the recording quality has to be the poorest I have ever witnessed. The volume was minimal, and the quality was so poor that most words were indistinguishable. Yelling at the microphone produced acceptable results during gaming sessions but I lost my voice fairly quickly. - [personal issue] The screen arrived with slight white discoloration at the center from the start. The discoloration proceeded to become more intense over the course of several weeks. I didn't return to amazon because i didn't feel like they would take the issue seriously and charge me a restocking fee. - [personal issue] Three months after purchase. the screen developed a yellow tint and the windows key stopped working. There was no damage to the computer, it all just happened out of the blue.  Things to Consider: - Not all games support SLI card configuration. The dual 965m cards work well enough to run the latest games at max settings, 1080p, +30fps, but scaling things to the 3k resolution grinds fps down to a halt, even more so if the games don't support SLI. - Several editing programs like lighroom and sony vegas pro that have the potential to use GPU acceleration don't work well with SLI setups. Even turning SLI off and relying on one card doesn't help editing things much faster. As such I wouldn't recommend this model to those who wish to do serious media editing.  Overall: Assuming I received a poor unit of this model and that others perform much better, I believe that the strongest and the weakest aspect of this computer is the 3K screen. The computer functions best with gaming as media editing on it is rather slow. Unfortunately the 3K resolution is too much for the two SLI cards to handle under max-quality gaming conditions and users have to make the trade-off between full-resolution vs max quality settings with their games. That's a trade-off that just should not be present for top-tier systems like this one considering it costs well over $2,000.
Never worked....started  Very disappointed with this tablet....very, very Waste of time......lost confidence in Samsung. It was nicely packaged....that is about all folks. But as they say.......it is not whats on the outside that matters
I was so excited to get this for my son and when it came and we started to set it well that when the excitement left.... because the touch mouse on the key board doesn't function right. .. so we had to run to a store to get a working mouse ....not what I expected and now my son says it's extremely slow... and will not hold his school work which is the whole reason for the purchase ....
Unfortunately, 2 defective machines  I wanted to love this laptop--beautiful display, monster specs, great price, and ASUS's good reputation.  I bought this model May 25, 2012 and unfortunately, the machine started slowing down, freezing up, then getting Blue Screens for no apparent reason within 48 hours out of the box.  I contacted Amazon, and happily, was able to get a replacement within a couple of days.  Life with the brand new replacement model was going well for a couple weeks, until it too, started exhibiting the same issues as the first!  It was too much of a coincidence.  Sadly, I had to return the second one for a refund as I didn't want to press my luck on a third replacement.  Too bad because I truly enjoyed the machine (both of them) up until the moment it croaked.  The majority of positive reviews for this machine seem to reflect the fact that for the most part, people received a great computer--if it worked.  A small handful of users, unfortunately, may have received duds.  A sad truth about mass manufacturing nowadays, but it happens :-(  Kudos to Amazon though for superb customer support.
Avoid  This is by far the worst laptop I have ever owned.  The desk top is completely unintuitive, and you're constantly being interrupted by software updates.  It is almost impossible to work with a document from an external thumb drive. And I have experienced multiple crashes, including one that wiped out three hours worth of work on the eve of a critical presentation, despite my repeated clicks on the save button.
HORRIBLE WIFI CONNECTIVITY  When I first received this computer I was fairly impressed with it. It is a very sleek computer with a modern design. It runs great and the touchscreen is very nice, but I would not recommend this laptop until the WIFI issue has been fixed.  The laptop has the worst wifi range of any device I own. My kindle fire has a longer range than the vaio 14 laptop. If im outside of 15-20ft of my router the laptop has 1-2 bars of connection in the same place where my older computer has full connection. This is outrageous for such a new computer. Unless you plan on leaving the Ethernet cable plugged in at all times DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP
Color and weight are perfect. However  Color and weight are perfect. However, When I open it, there is scratch on screen. so It bothers me now and I don't know why though It is new. and product key is not available so it couldn't activate. I requested ASUS for help regarding product key problem. but I want to solve this problem from you. so please reply to me asap.
The touch doesn't work. I can't instill any apps.
This is one of the bad choices that i made  This is one of the bad choices that i made. I really expected a good performance machine from samsung, but it doesn't even come close to my expectation. I can't watch any video in full screen because it's too slow. What a horrible graphics speed!
Windows 8 is the worst invention! But computer is fine.  I'm pretty good with computers, so it is not that I'm not a technology dummy. But Windows 8 is absolutely not user friendly. It is simply awful! :( Extremely hard to navigate through pictures, close/open applications, etc... I have a feeling that Windows tried to make something look "fancy" at the expense of convenience. We as humans already have a lot of stress in everyday life and trying to learn how to use this purely ILLOGICAL version only adds to it.  ...I've renamed a few picture folders and it seemed to go through but when I went back, the folder had the old name (is it a Windows 8 defect?) Also I deleted a few pictures, yet they are still showing up as a "Cover" in Pictures App. So I go and open the app, but they are not there. I think the computer itself is fine, it is just Windows 8 that really makes me upset. I'm extremely unhappy with it and wish I returned it sooner when I had a box and everything (I bought it in June '13 and now is April '14). But I was giving it hope that I would get used to it. Really wish I stuck with Windows 7. So upset :-(
POOR WASHED OUT DISPLAY!!!  The display is very washed out and dull; no vibrancy. Everything else is ok though. Speakers could be a bit better as well. Poor location for SD card reader. Flimsy DVD drive tray.
not even ok for the price  I bought one of these computers a few weeks ago. It is sufficient for documents and internet. The best feature is the price and the fact that it can play DVDs, which some in this price range can't. The worst problem is the touchpad, which does not work well. Moving the cursor over a page will lead to unexpected windows popping up, as if I had clicked on a link. UPDATE in March 2015: I have had this computer for 5 months now and changed my rating to 2 stars.  It is a piece of junk.  Why 2 stars?  Well, 1 star is the worst and it does have a decent price.  But you get what you pay for.  In the last 11 years, I have had a Toshiba, which was good, followed by two Apples.  The first Apple was great but the second had a defect (I didn't think they were supposed to have defects!).  After this Dell, I will probably go back to Toshiba.
FINAL UPDATE: Ok, I was lucky that I created a restore point before the 80% charging mode problem. So I went back to 100% charging and had to reinstall a few programs. Overall I really am very happy with this laptop. It is fast, you can install a Windows 7 classic look. As it is not a touchscreen, and I hate Windows 8 as well, Google "Classic Shell" and you are all set. Hard drive is 1TB, I guess I will fill it one day.  Really do not miss the DVD drive, most programs are downloads, and Netflix is better than DVDs so it is really thin and lightweight.  Aside from the 80% charging problem, the battery is held in by two screws, not sure how I feel about that, not sure it matters except for long flights when I used to carry two batteries. Don't think the TSA allows screwdrivers on flights, but the battery does last a long time 3 hours depending what you are doing.  ------------------------------------------------------- Update - lowered to one star. if you select "eco mode" you caN NO LONGER CHARGE YOUR BATTERY TO 100% - EVER  Google "80% not charging" it is not just a Toshiba thing !!! This is crazy. How many hours am I wasting on this. Even with Google, and everyone having problems I have not been able to solve the problem. Only have a 15 day return period so this weekend and Monday will tell if I keep it or send it back.  As all laptops seam to suffer from this 80% deal I am guessing the stories that modern batteries do not have a memory effect is what I thought all along. I use the Sanyo now Panasonic eneloop AA rechargeables and ALWAYS discharge after they drop to 1.2 volts using a smart charger, discharge then charge. I have my first ones still showing 1800-1900 mAh from 2007. I understand keeping your laptop on AC power 90% of the time will kill a battery. I think the 80% eco option should be EASY to use. Not a once on never off thing. Hope an update comes out soon for those long days with no AC I want to charge to 100% the night before.  If anyone from Toshiba reads this how about a way to turn charging off for long days on charger, and back on again when I need it, or I guess I can unscrew the two screws holding the battery. Turning off charging in software makes sense - but I need to charge to 100% once in a while.  When Toshiba updates this problem I will change my rating of what I on day four think is a great laptop.  Ok, only one day so I will revise this review, so follow it.  Pros: great i7-4710 processor   good screen - not touch   battery is held in by two screws - weird but at least I can one day change the battery very easy   looks like 4.5 hours or more on battery GREAT   has bluetooth and paired easy with my headset (HP did not have bluetooth, really)   It boots quickly and shuts down fast.  Win 8.1 runs DosBox, so all my DOS programs are running fine.  My early windows programs are running, have not tried my American Heritage Dictionary which stopped working with Win 7  and who cares if I spell things right or wrong. (Hope it will work, doubt it will install)    Bid PLUS, battery life is excellent - if running from 100% - NEVER USE "ECO" MODE you lose 20% of you battery  No DVD drive - might be a plus or minus - it saves power, and DVD drives are not used as much anymore I do have a USB DVD drive, was how I found out about the bios changes need to boot from it. The DVD drive is seen without BIOS changes, and does play DVDs and I will test read and write some ore. I rather have longer battery life, so for me it is a PRO.  Cons: To boot from USB you have to change BIOS settings, which will not see the hard drive when you reboot, scared me   you CAN see the drive after booting from USB, I did not check if I can write or read to it. Just wanted a clean backup which I think I got   will post more info as time goes on    HARD DRIVE SPEED IS ABOUT THE SAME AS MY DESKTOP WITH SATA 2 CONTROLLER AND HARD DRIVE   Based on DiskMarkx64 benchmark software, am starting to look at SSD drive, as my desktop with an SSD is 4 X faster, benchmarked   and you can SEE the difference. I do not know what controller is used in this laptop or which hard drive, but it is almost   twice as fast as the Acer 3.5 yr old laptop that died and it replaced, still I expected better scores as the sata 3 with sata 3 hard 7200 rpms   are a little over twice as fast - wish I knew what laptop drives would be faster..- minor problem most laptops have slow hard drives    keyboard is not backlit, this is not really a problem, except the function keys are horrible. The markings are NOT visible in most   lighting.even direct lighting, really small. I will use a Brother P-touch to put a label just above them, that's how bad they are.  The Brother P-touch labels are great, used white print on black - fixes that minor problem.  Warning, in the bios you can choose function of function keys. The way it comes hit F5 and you turn off your mouse pad. Just remember the function keys work by hitting FN and then the key, which I forgot and had to Google the non-problem.  So, with the pros and cons I still rate it as 5 stars. I paid $599.99 at MicroCenter and at that price it is a five star computer. Maybe one day I will see about an SSD drive, the price is really dropping on them.  Should mention I choose this over the HP Envy 55T as this was priced better and had bluetooth  Stay tuned for updates - I really like this laptop, so remember my one star is only for the crazy battery lock
If I Could Give No Stars, I Would  I bought this laptop for my boyfriends birthday which was 2 days ago. I bought it towards the end of February since I wanted to be for sure that it arrived on time. I am so pissed off. We turned it on and it showed Windows starting up, then flashed to  a blue screen, then a black screen and said "Windows cannot repair this computer." I tried reinstalling Windows, no luck. I think the hard drive is corrupt. Last time I buy electronics on Amazon. Also, since I bought it over 30 days ago, guess who spend $400 and isn't getting a refund or new computer? This girl!
Dead just passed the 1 year warranty.  lasted a year and 4 months before the motherboard went out. For the price and use I got it just wasn't worth it.
I wish I bought a better  Too small and I can't restart it unless I turn it off . And there's some features that u can't download . Just did appointed . I wish I bought a better ine
After about 4 months, won't boot up  After about four months, this machine one day (and forever after) won't boot up. Can't recover, restore, reinstall...nothing. A big paperweight.
Bad experience  Was really nice until I plugged it in out of the box and it doesn't turn on. Really disappointed.
Wish I could give it a negative star rating  Toshiba Satellite models come at an attractive price, but that's about all I can say in their favor. My Satellite laptop has had 4 trips to the repair depot, the first one only one week after I bought it. That repair took almost a month, and failures have included 3 mother boards. Thankfully I bought the extended warranty. I called their customer relations dept. today to inquire about my options with an obvious lemon and was told they would only repair it again. The customer service rep. refused to let me speak to anyone else when I asked politely to speak to a supervisor, and when I asked for a phone number for their U. S. Headquarters said she didn't have that phone number.  At least one Satelitte model has been the subject of a class action lawsuit due to the large number of failures; the resolution was simply to repair any models whose warranty had expired. I'd look elsewhere for a laptop.
My comments to the products.  I already return the Acer C720 Chromebook and the Air Sleeve. However I kept the Mouse. I thought the Chromebook is two small for what I'm expecting. I'll try to find other products at Amazon.
Lemon of a computer  I bough this computer in June and it stopped working last month. Now I am looking for another computer.nwill not buy another from Amazon though.
SLOW  First of all, you get what you pay for; this is cheap and SLOW! I tried to work with it for about 2 1/2-weeks but it would lock up all the time, even during minor things like creating formulas within Excel. I was only planning to use it for writing school papers and utilizing Excel for a few personal things, nothing major like media/gaming. I returned it and paid the money for a faster computer.
Computer Only Worked For a Few Months  The Air came in the mail in a timely fashioned. Nicely packaged, small cosmetic damage, nothing big. It still had another person's profile on the laptop, so I just made my own. I bought this several months ago and at first it worked fine. As of yesterday, it stopped connecting to Internet entirely. I am very displeased because I can not return it and have wasted a lot of money.
Hinge broke, less than a year old  High points: Nice, fast operating system. Clear HD screen.  Low points: The hinge that allows the laptop to close broke. I have only had it for 4-5 months and the plastic hinge piece broke. The laptop won't close without breaking the screen. There are pieces of broken plastic falling out of the bottom of the laptop. I called the manufacturer to get it replaced since it was less than a year old and was told I would be charged around $200 to get it fixed because it was a CID (induced damage). I babied this laptop and rarely used it for the 4-5 months I had it. I complained to the manufacturer that being charged for a faulty made product was wrong. This was not my fault; laptops are meant to close.  Beware of this product and the manufacturer.
Not what we expected.  PC very slow. Could not link via home network. Called Dell phone support who turned out to be quite hostile. Kept insisting we upgrade to a pay for support. We've had the laptop for less than 5 days. We have another Dell - same model - purchased from Costco with Costco Concierge service. Great support and lasts as long as you own your laptop. Would not buy through Amazon again given the poor support after purchase. Dell support transferring us from one place to another. Most unhelpful. Michael Dell would not be pleased with this customer experience. The machine must be a stripped down model.
Doesn't live up to Amazon choice product  I bought this laptop for my office in September and the port is already damaged. It doesn't type well and it doesn't live up to Amazon Choice ratings.
Please DON'T buy!  Please DON'T buy this laptop. I swear it's a garbage!! I returned it at the same day I received it. Incredibly slow. You will not be able even to play a Youtube video. In addition, the screen is badly horrible. It looks old yellow and will hurt your eyes. NOT recommended at all.
Terrible performance  Terrible DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER I did a ton of research before buying this computer, which is probably why I feel so bad buying it thinking I had done my homework and I was so wrong. Everyone told me to switch to Apple but I felt very robotic when you step in a coffee shop and see everyone working solo on their apple or starring at the screen and they all look the same. So I figured I am going to look for a sleek computer that is great on performance and look.  Let me just say, this machine is like a bad bad relationship experience. Its good looking but such a huge disappointment and for the price, a massive let down.. I had a rather ok experience with a cheaper uglier previous Samsung laptop, so I figured I stay loyal and really splash out to buy something of the same brand but much nicer. So I coughed up 1100$ on this piece of garbage and boy Do I REGRET IT. As soon as I got it, I knew something was off. The machine was SLOW as a 500 year old turtle and believe me my older $400 Samsung out performed this one. As a good loyal and patient person, I figured it must be my internet connection. But the bottom line was when everyone with their cheapo Dell was hooking on and I was stuck on my good looking but terrible machine. WORST SAMSUNG COSTUMER SERVICE And then It was down hill from there. So since I still had the warranty for one year, I called what I consider the worst experience in customer service. 15 calls later and me chasing them to fix this piece of garbage and finally they agreed to have it be sent for repair. Once it arrived back, it worked well again for a few days and consistently slowed down again. Now 4 days after my warranty ran out, I get a message that the screen driver has crashed twice a day. I stopped using this garbage and already in a market for another laptop. Do not waste your money or fall for the looks.  SAMSUNG COSTUMER SERVICE: TEEEERRRRIBBBBLE. I would never buy another Samsung product. I wasted
Worse Computer I Ever Had  Worst computer I ever had in my life.  Only had it since January and for the first 3 months I spent so much time talking with the company because I had so many problems.  When I plugged in speakers, the INTERNAL mic stopped working.  There is one jack for speakers and microphone- only one and although I had an internal mic, not a mic in the jack, the Internal mic stopped working.  Problem after problem.  The DVD player gave me problems in the beginning.  I had to buy an adapter so that I could use headphones and mic with a USB connector on it.  Now the computer won't even recognize my speakers even when I take the headphones out.  Absolute worst computer I ever had.  They wanted to charge me 99 dollars to help me after I have talk to them time and time again about multiple problems.  I only kept it because I had so much schoolwork I couldn't afford to take time to get another computer.  Horrible computer, just horrible.  I added an external mouse and so now the mouse on the computer simply shut down and never worked again.  You can't play CDs on it.  It's often very slow.  I had questions on it when it was in warranty and people couldn't even answer it.  Just terrible.
That is too bad, i bought it one month ago  That is too bad, i bought it one month ago, but the system always doesn't work. Is it a new laptop? Or just refurbished
I got one with the wrong size SIM card.  I got one of these deals on Woot.com. It took a while to get the 2 years versus lifetime free 4g service thing figured out. The real problem is that these units ship with a mini-SIM card, when the unit requires a micro-SIM; and the seller was unwilling to replace the incorrect SIM card with the correct one. I returned it.
awful product  I am returning the mini notebook. It was difficult to operate and a completely frustrating piece of garbage. I thought I should give it a chance but it was terrible. I am returning the computer within the 30 days as instructed by Amazon.
Had potential to be a great laptop  Other's may have had a good experience with this laptop, but me . . . not so much.  First off, I must say that the design of the laptop is great.  I love the tactile surface of the keyboard, the screen is beautiful and the layout is good.  Alienware was supposed to the be the best.  So, upon opening the box I see a laptop with no seals, no wrapping and the bottom has some white powdery material.  Hmm . . . is this an open box item?  Ok well I fire it up and use it, everything appears to be working good.  Fast forward a few days and I get curious about the 1TB hard drive and thinking about replacing it with an SSD.  I remove bottom access panel and one of the screws won't unthread.  Looks like the nut in the frame of the computer broke off and the screw isn't attached to anything.  The access panel "snaps" in, so a broken fastener is not a big deal.  Fast forward a few more days and I notice that the screen bezel is separating from the screen.  There is an illuminated "ALIENWARE" logo just below the screen and I can see light leaking between the gap of the screen and bezel.  Now I'm done . . . unacceptable.  I give the 1-800-ALIENWARE support number a try hoping I can ship free back to them and have them replace this low quality assembled piece of junk.  1:04 hours on the phone and at one point getting a human just to be shuffled to another line and I'm done.  Alienware and Dell had their chance to impress me with the greatest laptop on the planet and they failed.  Thanks to Amazon for their generous return policy, it went back yesterday.
Motherboard Replaced Twice - Reaching out for Assistance from Distributor  This device would not power on for anything when I received it (and yes, I charged it). I attempted to reach out to the distributor but had no luck there. I contacted Dell and sent it to them to check it out. Upon them returning it, I learned they had to replace the LCD panel along with the Motherboard. On a brand new laptop? As a loyal Dell customer, I gave it the benefit of the doubt and attempted to use the laptop. I'm not sure I can express how ungodly slow the laptop worked. It was nearly torturous. My old Dell (which I'm using to write this review) is 7 years old now. It has half the capacity of the new one (RAM and hard drive) and again - is 7 years old. This thing runs like a champ compared to this Inspiron I purchased. Also - it's worth noting, the Inspiron I purchased was not supposed to be a touchscreen, however, it had one. A feature I specifically did not wish to have.  I attempted to use the laptop a handful of times after the first repair. However, it went back to not turning on again. If the device did power on, it would give a variety of error messages. I called Dell again, and even the rep was getting impatient with how slow the device was moving from one command to the next. She advised that it had to be the motherboard, and was extremely surprised when I told her they had already replaced it.  This product has been nothing but a headache since day one. As a full time college student taking only online courses - I need a laptop that I can depend on. This one has been far from dependable. Having sent it back twice now for repairs, it's been nothing but an inconvenience and a total waste of money and time. I will be attempting to reach out to the distributor again. At this point, I would rather have my money back towards a new laptop. A brand new one shouldn't have this many issues.
Keyboard and tech support stinks!  I just got this in today and part of the key board did not work. I spent close to two hours with different tech supports - one of which had no clue how to fix the computer, the other told me to just return it via amazon and get another one. Very disappointed. I am not sure on any other aspect of this computer because I couldn't even use the key board to get it up and running.
It was so slow that it would barely open emails.  There was no way to use it for games.  I had to return it and bought one locally.
Toshiba's design's problem  1. system is too hot, but some people happy if they stay in the Alaska 2. In the fist week, there are 5 tims of screen hang after system resume back if re-open the cover. I wrote a MS power point file for presentation to customer in my cubicle then closed the cover of notebook and brought it to conference room. The system is no screen anymore after I open bck the cover. I had to reboot my system and my PPT file was gone. I don't want it will be happen again, so I return it. 3. I didn't receive the credit back after I had sent it back to Amazon two weeks.
Wouldn't recommend  Bought this laptop just before christmas 2011, never got the extended warranty but still had the default 1 year one and just recently dropped it and the screen cracked. I called them and they said it would cost $90 to ship it and diagnose it and then $449 if the led was broken apparently it doesn't cover a cracked screen. Outrageous money hungry company. The laptop was good all around and worked great but if you really want it BE CAREFUL! I would highly suggest looking at other laptops before making this your final decision, there are better ones out there.
Do not buy if you plan on typing on this computer  Worst laptop on the market. The right shift key is something you will not get used to, it is in an awful position
It would be a great product otherwise on my opinion  I have my lenovo for one year now. It got broken several times since i bought it. One day the screen just became black and it wouldn't turn on at all. So all inside of the notebook has been changed 2 times. Now I have another problem that keyboard keys are falling off, and it is not covered by warranty, so it cost 171 for 1 hr of work of the person who repairs it, that starts and end with person leaving and coming back to the office. I live in Finland, so maybe in other places it is not so expensive. It is expensive notebook and to have these kinds of faults is unacceptable. It is the fastest computer I've ever had, also light. It would be a great product otherwise on my opinion.
Samsung Q430  It's definitely a very bad computer. ThE main problem is the overwarm of the computer and this turns off all the time. everytime there is a delay in work situation, their next step is turned off. Unfortunately Samsung did not respond to this request.
It was slow slow slow..
defective  defective buy something different or build a pc
I FEEL ROBBED, ABUSED, DISSAPOINTED AND BEYOND!!!! =(  I FEEL ROBBED!!!  Terrible!!! I bought a Toshiba with the below specification and I received a complete different product. I'm totally disappointed with the product, service, quality, management and beyond!!!

Keyboard problems, then in 16 months the hard disk died  From the beginning we had a flawed keyboard with a space bar that didn't work well. Probably should have returned it, but we were too busy and got "adapted" to using it anyway.  After a year, the machine would occasionally just shut down.  Then after 16 months, the hard drive failed.  Not a good experience, overall.  By now it's an old model, so probably best to look for something more modern (and reliable).
Do yourself a favor and don't buy anything Lenovo  Lenovo's sub-par products are only matched by their terrible customer service and support. Initially you'll think "oh man, this is a pretty good laptop", but within a year, after your warranty expires, it'll all sink in.  Right off the bat, you should notice the terrible wifi. I'm sure if you've done enough research, you'd know Lenovo is notorious for this, and its not blown out of proportion. Their wifi is dreadful. My phone gets faster speeds. I tested it once, and got a dl speed of around 20 mbps. Fast right? well, my phone on the same connection got around 60. a MacBook got around a 100. Wow even as I was writing this the laptop randomly disconnected.  The main reason I discredit Lenovo is because they don't take responsibility for their poor manufacturing. They cut corners. A lot. For me, it was the hinge. This is actually a common issue if you Google it. The hinge of the laptop often comes out by itself (plastic around the screws where hinge was attached to back lcd panel breaks from the strain because of poor design). The best part? Laptop was under two years old and yet Lenovo refuses to acknowledge its their fault.  Also, the LCD and battery life are pretty bad.  Seriously though, stay away from Lenovo.
I messaged the seller and he said contact toshiba but I feel this is bad advertising.  The bluetooth doesnt work properly, I messaged the seller and he said contact toshiba but I feel this is bad advertising.
Graphic dies spontaneously.  Audio significantly softer after 6 months of use.  I purchased this 6 months ago. I had used the computer mostly at home. But I did carry it to my trips. I take with me to school sometimes. I didn't drop the computer on the ground or anything. But the quality and performance just seems to have dropped. I didn't upgrade to extra memory yet. I have been meaning to. But I don't think upgrading the memory will make my graphic work better.  I will not purchase any computer with the same graphics engine in the future.  Sometimes the graphics crashes. I have had it crash on me more than 3 times.  It's intolerable in a laptop that's only 4 months old. I wish I could return it to the manufacturer. Also, out of nowhere, my audio strength have reduced. I checked sound in control panel, I checked the mixer and made sure it wasn't the control.  I can't even hear Youtube videos without cranking it to the max audio. My audio is always maxed out and youtube videos and webinars I attend are all so soft.  It's most annoying thing about the computer ever. It's only been 6 months since I purchased!  Had I known this would happen, I would not have purchased. I will not buy Acer computer ever. This was my first and last.
Ask me why I hate my SONY VIAO  I hate this EXPENSIVE computer- SONY VGN-TZ180N - and I am angry every time I boot it up. My screen got a crack which I believe was due to the warping of the frame around the screen related to the excessive heat caused by the fan problem.  I wrote to Sony and they would do nothing for me regarding the cracked screen due to the overheating frame. I was a loyal customer. This is VAIO number 2 - but believe me, it's my last.  I now have a big sign on the lid of my laptop which reads "ASK ME WHY I HATE THIS COMPUTER". I spend half my time in airports and airport lounges and I get a lot of questions about my sign. I suggest everyone else do the same.  Sony did replace my fan - (but it still overheats and is too hot for my lap - really, it burns me if I have on thin clothes, like pj's).  The technician who came to my house (I live remote) told me that these computers had a lot of factory assembly problems. DUH!
I sent it back because the color I picked they sent me the wrong color. And the worst part is the laptop cannot open unless you put the charger. If the charger was not there the laptop will not work.
Sound Issue  2 months later, got a blue screen and now sound will not work. Both headphone jack and speakers. There are other reviews here with the same issue.
Screen resolution is probably the worst part about all of this  This was delivered tonight. Returning right away. I know this Chromebook was cheap, but it definitely FEELS cheap. Smaller than you'd think and keys are underwhelming. Screen resolution is probably the worst part about all of this.
$1400 for THIS? Why!?  Ok so, as noted, I got this computer gratis from the Amazon Vine program. So my dislike for it as a whole isn't at all realted to losing a large chunk of change. Now my situation is thus -- I have been a desk top user all my life, never much used a laptop and never had one of my own. I HAVE been in the market for one, though never did much research. So make no doubt, having this around is extremely useful. But that said, I seriously question how anyone could think it's a good value. Others have gone into great detail about what it comes with and the specs, so I will hit some of the highlights of what I do and don't like about it.  Likes: -It's light. Perhaps the easiest thing to notice, and from what I gather one of the biggest draws of the ultrabook line. It's incredibly light and one can easily used it one ones lap for a long time with no issue. -A touchscreen. This is incredibly useful, especially given the issue with the mouse I'll get to later. It's quite responsive, etc. -A nice carrying case. The case it comes with is nice and soft. It does have the Acer logo plastered all over it but eh... -An SSD drive. It's amazing how fast this thing is. The computer boots up in like five seconds. Everything runs smoothly and seamlessly. -Battery life. Supposedly another point of reason for the ultrabook line, the computer can go for quite a long which without being recharged. I saw it at close to eight hours even after it was on for three hours, though I mainly had it open to look at the screen while doing other things.  Neutrals: -Windows 8.1. I'm really not a fan of it, but it's not really a negative because there's really no way of avoiding it on a system like this. As far as I can tell nothing is stopping anyone from installing another OS anyway -HDMI out. I can see why someone might want to use it, but I can't see too many people caring given other options, especially considering what I say below. It doesn't hurt anything being there though  Dislikes: -The touchpad/mouse. Oh god, who thought it was a good idea to hide where the mouse buttons are? Seriously, that's one of the least intuitive things I've ever seen. On top of that, the right 'button' is only in the lower right corner, the entire rest of the pad is a left mouse button. This design makes no sense. I'm not a fan of touchpads anyway, but this takes the cake -The keyboard. In an effort, I guess, I reduce the weight there are far less keys than normal. The function keys are combined with the number keys, there's no numpad at all, the arrow keys are pretty small, and a few other things. The keys also seem somewhat unresponsive. -The speakers are on the bottom. How does this make any sense, to put them where they will be muffled 95% of the time? There's a headphone jack, thankfully, though it';s just barely at a good volume when turned all the way up (which, granted, is better than my last new computer). -256GB in the hard drive. Yeah I know SSDs are expensive, but given you can't upgrade them it's a big issue. In this day and age that's just extremely tiny. One could hook up an external HD I guess, though -The graphics processor. Now this is, perhaps, the thing that gets me the most. This laptop is $1400. How in the holy hell is there not a decent graphics processor here? I know there wouldn't be a dedicated card or anything but at least this early 2015 machine should be able to run things better than by midline 2010 machine....but it doesn't in the least. RIP any decent gaming on this thing, or any other graphics stuff one might need to do. -All the crapware installed. Seriously, why do computer companies feel the need to put this insane crap on new machines? Again, one could theoretically make a fresh OS install but still.... -No CD drive. I know a lot of people think it outdated, but I use CDs regularly, and I'd never ever buy a machine as my main one where I couldn't use them. -The price. Of course I've mentioned this multiple times, but it needs reiterating. This machine is /$1400/. For that price one could get an "Outstanding" desktop, with a monitor. Obviously it'd lack portability, but it'd have plenty more HD space, dedicated and powerful graphics, lots of room for add ons, etc etc. This machine would be ok at $400. Not at $1400.  So yeah, I have to boggle in general at the praise this thing gets. What it had in being light weight and power thrifty is hugely off set by what it lacks in horsepower and just how over priced it is.
Definitely get more RAM and an SSD for this laptop.  I bought this laptop about 2 years ago from Best Buy. I bought it for school and I loved the big display and it had more than enough storage for me. However, just three months later, it started to slow down considerably. It took about 20 seconds to boot up and the battery life worsened. I suspect that the amount of RAM and slow hard drive contributed this.
Not for me  Too often I would find it not being able to stay connected to the internet. I was unable to download iTunes to it. Dell support was awful to deal with. And the settings are simply annoying. Just not for me.
Laptop will not charge.  The product is of bad quality. In the name of certified laptop, I was sent a laptop which won't even charge. These are being by sold by third party and not directly by amazon or apple. Buyers beware!
Overheats easily.  Lots of software issues. Resetting the laptop and the sound would not work. Drivers would not install. Reset again and the Wifi didn't work. Overheats easily.
Product was defectuve no backlight ,was previusly open liked used. When to Best Buys and all the Asus on the floor you could turn the backlight on and off Press F/N and F4 bingo.
2 Asus Rog G751JY both arrived with defective screens...  I normally don't write reviews, so I'm going to keep this simple...my initial laptop and replacement laptop both arrived DOA. Both laptops had screens that were black with white lines when powered on. Yes, Asus, I did the recommended hard reset! After receiving 2 laptops with the same problems, I requested a refund.
It's a pity because it looked like a nice piece of hardware  This didn't work out of the box - could not update Windows 10, could not update BIOS, Windows store, internet browser, all say their trial has expired, etc. It's a pity because it looked like a nice piece of hardware.
Not at all upto the expectations.
none  did not like
Touchpad is horrid.
stay away  This computer has one problem after another, especially with the camera and staying connected to a wireless internet.  It constantly lost connection.  It was not a solid unit either.  We returned it almost right away.
SUPER annoying, and was not expecting that  Worrrsssst laptop ever! No CAPS button, just a search button? As if I couldn't type directly into the search bar in the engine? No alt+reblog for tumblr, which is what I basically bought a computer for, was blogging. No CD or DVD rom at all! SUPER annoying, and was not expecting that.  Very basic laptop. I feel like a kid that gets a simplified-for-children iPad. Absolutely NOT what I was expecting. Will be buying a different laptop and selling this one.
Can't run any game you'd play today, even on the lowest settings, oh well
This was my first major purchase through Amazon. Amazon did everything right. But the computer was a lemon. After unpacking it, everything looked good but when I went to turn it on the system booted up into the BIOS, after I set the date and time and did the "save and exit" all the system would do was recycle back to the BIOS. I called Amazom they issued me a return and I went ahead and ordered a different laptop.
Maybe I'm just an uninformed consumer - but that sucked!  Doesn't even play cd's or dvd's. Maybe I'm just an uninformed consumer - but that sucked!
does not work with windows 10 shuts down drivers
too expensive for the money,not that I am saying it is a bad toy, but not worth the money invested on this.  used many years and now switch to chromebook (hp 14) and very happy paying a fraction of this price and getting a similar service. long live competition! cons: my first macbook was cracked, broken, screen went black, and charger was blown up! I went to service, they asked 2 laptop price for the fix it, oh yeah, do I look insane? just bought the new chromebook! best decision ever! pros: it gives you a sense that you are cool, does not last long though!
Disappointed  I loved this laptop when I first purchased it one year ago.  For one year, I had no problems.  Loved the speed and especially the superb screen resolution.  I take lots of digital pictures, so screen quality was important to me.  I also loved that there was a port for my Sony camera's memory card.  Now the bad news...after one year of working beautifully, it just crashed.  It was dead.  The lights on the keyboard surface lit up, but other than that, nothing.  No noises and a black screen.  I took it into Best Buy's Geek Squad for diagnosis.  They told me it's the motherboard.  It could be up to $1100 to fix.  That's almost as much as the cost of the computer itself.  So here I am with one shiny, sleek, beautiful laptop...but I have to toss it.  One thing is for certain, I will never buy another laptop without an extended warranty, no matter what brand it is.
Computer arrived and had no operating system.  Computer wouldn't even turn on. Waited on hold with HP for 1 Hour and 30 Mins. before hanging up.
Yikes.  Within a week of use fingerprint feature stopped working. Screen line appeared, computer froze at times. Quite disappointed
Don't make the same mistake I did. Look somewhere else.  Computer not as advertised. Description shows it has an led screen, book shows LCD screen. Description claims 10 hour battery life, computer shows 3 hour battery life. Book is worthless, it has no worthwhile information. Description shows Windows 10, book shows Windows 7 & 8. DVD drive only works part time, if at all.
popped, cracked, and slow :(
Cheap flimsy case, wonky factory OS  I have had my Lenovo G500S for almost exactly 2 years now. And I don't believe I will get another year out of it.  First problem I had when new was an internet connection that was unstable, then after the windows 8.1 upgrade it became almost useless. I did re-format the hard drive and installed Ubuntu OS. Have had no problems with connection since. All the bells and whistles work including the touch screen.  Then the bad started! Just as the 1 year warranty expired the cheap plastic case started spitting out screws and cracking also. As of last spring the hinges started going bad and I have not been able to close the lid without spending 10 minutes with a knife to get it open as now the lid catches on the base. And every time I now pick it up I find little pieces of black plastic on the table under it.
Sorry, my beloved Dell 2.5 stars this time...  This is a 2.5 stars review. I didn't mark 3 stars because of the Dell deteriorating customer service. I am very sad to admit it because I have been a Dell person since I remember. I simply love Dell and I was extremely tolerant and patient about this product.  It was sold to me as NEW by: Ecc1908Okkk and Fulfilled by Amazon. I am a regular user who uses her laptop for basic browsing, emails, some video streaming. Once or twice a week I work from home so I use it for the Citrix application.  Upgraded to Win 10 (not sure if it was a good idea. I think people who got a new tattoo pose the same question). Added additionally 4 GB of RAM so I have 8 GB. The difference? I don't have my $29.  PROS: Nice, sleek, very compact design, good and responsive keyboard. Rather sturdy feel. Looks and feels like a more expensive laptop. Very decent screen with a very good resolution. Never had any issues with video streaming.  Battery. After using it for a year it still holds for  5 hours or so.  CONS: Mouse. One word: nightmare. Or comedy. Or both. Your choice. It stops working or it goes completely crazy. At some point I started to use a wired mouse because my frustration would lead our neighbors to call for a professional (definitely clinical) help. Imagine that you are with your laptop on your laps (hence its name I guess;), in your bad, on your sofa and you *must* ( being literally forced to) use a wired mouse. Installed new drivers twice. Worked for a month or so and then "here we go again festival"  Web browsing. Never ever, please do not even try to open more than 4 (four) tabs. Does't matter which browser I used....Chrome, IE, Edge (of nervous breakdown). Takes two seasons to upload the fifth tab.  Power savings options. Must be its mouse's cousin. For no reason the screen suddenly decides to go black like going to a sleep mode but it still reacts when you type any key, switching itself on for ....barely 2 seconds and then it...immediately goes back to sleep ...again. You're typing and it winks to you and then ....it ignores you. You need to restart it. There is no  way to stop the screen from falling asleep. This happens even if your screen's settings (monitor sleep mode) say "NEVER"  Last but not least.... Dell customer service. Unfortunately it is located overseas so cultural difference ( I am trying to find a diplomatic way to describe it) can be a VERY assertive realty check. "Ma.m, did you buy it directly from Dell?" Me "No, I bought it from Amazon" " Why are you expecting it to work flawlessly? Maybe it's a refurbished  unit" Me "No, I bought a new one" "How can you be SO sure? You people buy a cheap laptop and expect miracles" Yes, it was not very expensive. I didn't have to sell my kidney nor did I have to visit a pawn shop with my engagement ring. I paid $350 back then. But hey... I wish I bought another model. No wonder that even over a year ago it was "discontinued". Lesson learned. Will never ever buy again if not *SOLD and fulfilled by Amazon*  And please create a back up disk/recovery copy  for the OS because you may desperately need to reboot it a/o reinstall it otherwise you are on your own *or* ...simply get another laptop
Power issues.  I originally ordered a Warehouse Deal indicating it had just a few small marks- it didn't work- hit the power button and the green light blinked once, nothing else.  Same thing after charging for 24 hours.  I then ordered a NEW one from the manufacturer.  Powered right up.  A few hiccups, but it worked for a few days.  Tried to use it today- and same thing as the first one- hit the power button and green light blinks once, nothing else (it was charged).  Plug it in- same thing.  I do not recommend.
I had this chrome book for less than 3 months the screen started flickering contacted the company , they said that it can be  repaired and after many calls computer was returned to their repair center end of december 014 and I am still waiting for the status for repair. I maid numerous calls to the company and with no answer, This week I made another call they kept me on the phone for almost an hour they did not provide me with any answer and I am without a computer for almost a months. I tried to get on their web site to find status of my repair the page was not available because of maintenance issue? I will not buy their products again
Slow to load and needs maintenance  3 months after purchasing this the computer had a system crash and already needs service.  Spend your $$$ wisely on something better.
The system is very slow and may need a re-format.
Not so efficient  I am disapointed because I have to click 3 or 4 times for links, emails, and pages to open:(
Bad touchpad- buyer beware!  The touchpad quit working in the first two weeks.
Gave it out to some one as a gift.
Pros: Thin Light 4k GTX 970M (fast for gaming)  Cons: 48Hz (huge negative) No way to disable Optimus. Gold in color.  Other Thoughts: I have been waiting and waiting for a 15 inch 4k upgrade that wasn't significantly heavier/bigger than my macbook pro retina.  The main issue is that upon getting the laptop configured I found that the display is only 48Hz. This is not mentioned anywhere in the specs and is a pretty significant issue especially in something marketed as a 'gaming' notebook. I believe part of the reason for this is due to the optimus graphics which by the way is impossible to disable and get the GPU to drive the display directly.  The 48Hz and/or optimus causes issues for those of us who want to run linux but also in windows as I find dragging windows around is often laggy (low frame rate) or a huge delay (likely due to the non-60Hz refresh rate).  Needless to say this laptop was a huge disappointment.  I was pretty happy with the gaming performance but the 48hz and desktop use just ruined it for me.  IMHO any laptop or display that can not do industry standard 60Hz should be advertised as that being the case in big bolded/colord letters. They don't mention it on this one even in the detailed specifications.  I have a feeling the 48Hz is caused by the stupid optimus to begin with due to bandwidth limits of the intel graphics card.
Wifi connectivity Issues out of the box  Recieved this chromebook as a christmas present, and right out of the box it would only connect to my home wifi for 10 minutes at a time before disconnecting and requiring a reboot. I did some research to try to tackle the issue, but there did not seem to be an effective solution, so I returned it. Thank you amazon for your amazing return policy!
This Laptop is Simply Unusable  I was very excited to get started with a brand new, thousand dollar Samsung product. Unfortunately, Samsung sold me a lemon. The operating system has been wiped clean and the hard drive has been replaced. But it still won't work. I'm writing now from another computer because the Series 7 laptop is at the service center again.  The worst part of this entire experience has not been the product though, nor it's drag on my small business and my productivity. It has been Samsung's service. Samsung's strict, no exceptions policy is to only replace (not even refund) a device if it has been sent to a Samsung authorized service center at least twice. Now despite my 4 phone calls with Samsung, my repeated independent efforts to get it to work, one trip to a service center, the computer is repeatedly displaying the dreaded "blue screen of death." And they still won't even consider a refund. Shame on you, Samsung, not only for selling me a defective product but for refusing to acknowledge it in any meaningful way.
I was expecting better quality of this product  I have been using this laptop for 9 months, and I already have some keyboard keys not working (keyboard needs replacement); the battery life is very limited (2 - 3 hours), and it drains power even when it turned off. I was expecting better quality of this product. Reality is different and disappointing...
Very Fragile Netbook  The performance for this netbook is where it should be, although an upgrade to 2GB of RAM is definitely necessary. However, I must say that it is very flimsy. I have a tough case (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KEPZP0/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) but it has not been enough to prevent the screen from cracking. It's not like I put any extraneous pressure on the device. I put it in a carefully handled bag and took it with me on the go. I have had to send in the netbook twice to get the screen fixed and in both instances the chasis for the screen had to be replaced. Now, although the screen has not cracked, the hinge of the screen is breaking off more and more every time I try to open the device. I am very disappointed in the durability of this product and would recommend against any ASUS laptops or netbooks (I have had dead pixel issues with another ASUS laptop). The quality of their screens are horrible.
Don't waste your money  I only had this two days and the only thing I added to the computer is AOL and it's saying it's low on memory. It's loaded with all kinds of stuff I don't need
Wifi didn't work  Wifi didn't work, hardware issue, had to return it.
STOP! DON'T!  Do not buy this laptop! Every time you restart it it erases everything but what came with the laptop and you lose everything. I called HP and they wanted $159  to fix it. I told them where to shove it! A piece of garbage!
I sent it back, because I couldn't see the screen too well, and my fingers are too shakey for that smaller key board, also it didn't come with any real instructions on how to use it, and that is something that anyone that was born in the dark ages, way back it the 60's needs.
Great gaming computer.  I've had this computer for about 3 months now, and over all the performance of the laptop is great.  Gaming wise, I have almost no problem.  One awkward thing is the fan.  After a day or two of use, there is a subtle whistle from that fan.  The reason why this item got 2 star is because in the description it says that it has a 3.2 GHz processor speed, but when I received mine, it only has 2.4 GHZ.  Honestly, I am very disappointed to have paid for 3.2GHz and get less.
POOR CRAP QUALITY --- DO NOT BUY  I'd give this ZERO stars if I could.  Haven't had this product for two months and the hinge is broken with the screen peeling apart.  I keep this is a case and take extremely excellent care of my electronics, so this is unacceptable crap quality.
My screen stop showing for like 3months now

Battery Issue  I purchased this computer in February and the battery has already failed. They are going to take it back but I will be without my computer for an unknown period of time.
Not from this Company!  Opened laptop and got a message that read "computer needs repair". After typing in a few command codes, I found it had Win 10, when desc says Win 7. Called amazon who forwarded me to the manufacturer. After 20 mins spoke w someone who wanted to transfer me to another dept due to the model.
I loved this laptop 15 minutes at a time.  Warning: I probably just got unlucky with a bad SSD, you'll probably be better off than me, but then maybe you won't be!  I first saw this laptop while I was out in Japan, I fell in love with it on the spot. I love the build quality, form factor, screen and actually the keyboard is just fine, the laptop is very fast - and the touchpad on the laptop was great.  So I get back to the states and first thing I do is order one; next day I'm eagerly unboxing it, already well aware that I'd need to update the BIOS, wifi driver, and touchpad drivers. Surprise number one is that the touchpad is still horrible after the driver update. Turns out there are two different touchpads used. Sentelic and Elantech. Elantech  pads are good and work great - it's what I used in Japan. Sentelic are terrible and function poorly. Even after the driver updates the multitouch was barley functional and unreliable, disabling it wasn't really an option as side scroll didn't work despite being enabled in the config and I needed some way to scroll - even if it required some effort to function correctly.  Other than the terrible touchpad, the laptop is actually really nice - except it restarted, hung, crashed every few minutes even when just sitting idle.(On the bright side, it restarts and crashes really quickly.) I tried updating all the drivers, newest 207 BIOS, tried to do a memtest which crashed finally gave up and figured I'd just do a restore from the restore partition and see if that fixes it. I didn't think it would as it crashed out of the box, what I did not expect was that the restore itself would error out and crash mid restore leaving a laptop with no OS. I tried restoring again - four times. All failed.  So this laptop is being RMAed back to Newegg. At this point I'd ask for a refund(if I could) and try for something else - the touchpad really is that bad.  In the end, this laptop is just not ready for prime time. Unless you absolutely need an Ultrabook right now, wait - and if you can't wait, buy the Apple Air.  The touchpad is unacceptable. Wifi is weak at best. The power connector is flimsy, feels loose and is absolutely hideous. The Asus software is buggy - Asus Live Update is fickle and will not recover from errors at all. The fact that my laptop crashed in the first 10 minutes of use and proceeded to crash at least once every 30 minutes and sometimes right after restarting goes to show that the QA just isn't there.  You may get lucky. You may end up with a Elantech touchpad, a working headphone jack and a working SSD. Then all you'll be able to complain about is the weak wifi strength and ugly/flimsy power adapter. Of course you may also end up like me, with a brand new laptop sitting in a box after days wasted troubleshooting and now hopping through RMA hoops with fingers crossed that the next is working.  Update: Received RMA replacement. New laptop works great - but has a SanDisk SSD which is somewhat slower than the ADATA and has the "good" trackpad.
Faulty graphics card  Received unit with faulty fan on graphics card. Beautiful laptop but there must be some QC issues at HP.
Don't do it.  I literally loathe this computer.  It feels rattly and cheap. I bought it primarily to surf the internet and stream movies, and it is slower and glitchier than any laptop I have ever owned, despite being billed as being designed for this.  Additionally, it is  at the higher end of the budget laptop range.
Have not given up yet but right now sorry I made this purchase  Took a long time for me to decide what price range of laptop I wanted to buy.  I really wanted to go with the Surface Pro 3 but it's price was way more than the value I think I can get from a laptop.  Most of my day spent on my fairly new and pretty powerful desktop.  I have not yet give up on this laptop, but right now it's just not cutting it.  Way too many times when it becomes non responsive, with task app showing the CPU running at 100% and often the disk doing the same.  I expected it to be slower responding than my desk top but did not expect the super slow times.  In trying to trouble shoot I have reached the following conclusions: 1.  I sign onto the computer with the same Microsoft live account as my main PC.  I think this is the cause of many of my slow/stopped time periods. 2.  Initial slowness seemed related to two items.  The indexing that Windows wants to perform and the PC trying to sync all my Skydrive files.  Once I setup the laptop to never go to sleep (when plugged in) than I just left it to do it's thing for two days.  By the end of that time frame it had sync'd to its hearts desire and Skydrive was happy (I had a number of Skydrive folders setup to be available off line - for all these the laptop needed to copy the files over from Skydrive) 3.  During all this fuss I ended up hard wiring to my home network rather than using WiFi.  The WIFI seems adequate, but not when the machine has a lot of files to copy over. 4.  I was happy for a day or two.  Than I added Office 365, Multiplicity and couple of other small programs. 5.  The next day the laptop back to running at super slow mode.  Back to frequent 100% CPU and high disk percentage. 6.  Despite my best efforts the laptop seems to still try to emulate some of the desktop profile stuff - I think I set it up to use only a local profile but after a few days both machines end up with the same desktop and screen saver.  I have decided to do a complete restore and start over.  This time going with a fresh new Microsoft live account sign in.  Will see if I can get better than one star performance.  I hate to give up on having access to the same cloud, but right now I really don't use the cloud for any significant activity.  Will update this review later if I get above 1 star.
I'll stick with AMD from now on.  Worked fine when I first bought it.  Have had it about 6-8 months now, and it moves very slow, and freezes up a lot.  Only has the programs it came with and I added a Facebook app.  It also keeps asking for a password when starting even though I went to the settings and shut passwords off.
Beware Dell Customer Service  I purchased the Studio 17 on line from Dell.  Prior to purchasing the Studio 17, I called a Dell sales representatives.  I asked if I would notice a difference between the monitor on the Studio and the Dell SP2309W 23-inch monitor on my desk.  I was told the difference would not be noticeable.  Based on this information and my past excellent experiences with Dell machines and Dell support, I ordered the Studio 17.  I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the display on the Studio 17.  It was substantially less clear than my Dell SP2309W--really not suitable for the long hours I spend on my machines.  Confident that Dell would readily take this machine back (based on my past excellent experience Dell), I called Dell's returns department.  I was informed that a 15% restocking fee would apply, that these were the rules, and that there was no one who was authorized to waive this fee.  I noted that Dell's website clearly states that the fee does not apply if the "return is a direct result of a Dell error."  Direct misrepresentation by Dell's sales representative would seem to fit the common sense definition of an "error."  I was given a great deal of legalistic verbiage by a number of Dell employees, but no help of the sort that I would expect from Dell.  I was finally referred to Dell's legal department although no address or phone was provided.  I asked the simple courtesy that the return period of 21 days be extended while I pursued this option, I was told that this period was not extendable.  Dell's customer service policy appears to be Caveat Emptor.
Was not happy with this computer right from the beginning  Was not happy with this computer right from the beginning. Windows 8 is not an easy program to use. I have had this computer for 8 months and it just died. No kids play on this computer and now I can't even turn it on. Very frustrated and not happy at all with this computer.
Piece of junk  It's not even worth 1 star! This computer has NOT worked properly since I received it. I have only turned on (and attempted to use) this about 5 times! It's slower than molasses to start, it won't open the pictures I have downloaded from my camera and internet explorer doesn't even open! It's a waste of money! For some reason it keep disconnecting from my wifi at home, and, NO, my wifi speed isn't the problem. I'm want my money back!
Ok at first but terrible in the end...  Pro's & Con's:  Pro's: Nice looking Webcam is good with fun things to do with it.  Con's: HORRIBLE SCREEN; I once tripped over the cable and it fell and part of the laptop fell off and then it fell again and the whole screen cracked and went white. The system shut down a few times and we had to get it fixed. Then it happened again. Can get extremely hot.  I would not recommend this laptop for anybody!
Not a very good laptop.  Not a very good laptop...I just purchased one last month and returned it for a MacBook Pro. The laptop ovetheated on me 3 times, has a large fanning sound even on sleep mode and the mousepad is just terrible. The only good thing about this laptop is the keyboard. All in all I wouldnt recinmend this laptop.
DON'T BUY THIS PC, YOU'LL REGRET IT!!!  It really can't take the pressure with intensive gaming (GTAV, COD, BATTLEFRONT, etc.) like it claims. This Alienware DIED on 6/14/16, it only lasted 2 months, probably the motherboard burned up (piece of junk!!!) I called tech support we went through some trouble shooting and it was diagnosed with no post, just great! so the approved a replacement (thank goodness) overall process time is within 2 to 3 weeks, they said. BS It been 6 weeks and after constant emailing and calling Alienware hotline 3 times within a week and half, they told the shipping dept its all backed up. Seriously!? I'll be waiting endlessly for this thing. My next step will be taking this issue to the business bureau and requesting a full refund. That's $1,600 plus tax man!!!
Do not buy this apple MacBook A waste of my money never do it again
Very slow. Completly useless  The disk is at 100% all the time making the laptop useless. Last time that I buy a Dell
Rip off!  Anyone not being honest is you.....People I wouldn't go through this if it weren't true....This man need to tell the truth he sold me a non working computer, I sent it back and he is lying saying he never received it...I can only warn you guys one time so if you still give this man your business beware...If you do make sure you send it back priority mail so you can have a tracking number to follow it...that's the mistake I made by sending it through regular mail...he can deny and use it against you and say he never received it..That's why I am going through this now but, if you feel you need to steal my money you must really need it!...Just know Karma is real and what goes around comes around!
The volume is too low on it and I thought that it had a dvd/cd burner on it.
The tabs freeze basically five minutes after opening them, and the whole thing randomly shuts down and restarts.
DO NOT BUY FROM HP!!  What a huge mistake!!! They load the laptop with all sorts of crap software. So far I have spent several hours getting passed from person to person trying to get help from support.  DO NOT BUY FROM HP!!! It
poor hardware  We purchased a bulk of this item for the teachers in our school.  The software is excellent but we are very disappointed with the hardware. Before our units reached 1 year, most of us brought them to the service center already. most had chipped off parts. some had problem with hard disks.  the unit was covered for the first year but considering how easily it gets damaged, i think it won't take long 'til we need to spend more for this unit.  Please get the new mac book instead and don't settle for this unit. you will regret it!
I was a little bit disappointed, it didn't work at all  I was a little bit disappointed, it didn't  work at all. The light came on the IBook computer,but nothing  else work on the computer.
Non-stopping fan noise all the time  the laptop runs like jet plane all the time. The fan noise never stops and much loader than my desktop sitting of the floor.  I would consider this as a defect product.
the hinge problem still exists in this laptop do not buy this stuff!
really crappy keyboard - felt like i was typing on a paper plate. also tons of lenovo garbage was pre-loaded onto the laptop. dissapointed. looks better online in pictures than in real life.
Charger issues render the device useless  The charger died on us within a couple of months and a new one doesn't seem to be of any use.
Diferent keyboard  I expected a keyboard with a diferent type of the number pad, like they show us on the pictures. I'm upset.
Did not even get it.  I never got this item.  UPS does a really bad job I called them to ask them to hold my package in one of their facilities they say yes,  when I went to pick it up, they had already delivered it at my house, and since I moved a few days ago I guess it got lost,  please vendor get in touch with me I don't wanna lose my money.  The laptop is great though I bought one about 2months ago.  This was gonna be the second one.
This was a refurbished notebook and I was disappointed and disillusioned almost from the start  Power input shredded inside; power cable frayed at input.  screen jumped and opened/closed windows randomly ; mouse and touchpad stopped or moved cursor unpredictably.  I'm not sure the windows/touchpad things wer Asus's doing -- probably Windows 8. But the power input probem was theirs - happened 45 days after purchase.  This was a refurbished notebook and I was disappointed and disillusioned almost from the start.
Loved the color scheme. But windows 10 taking over half of the available memory  is not cool.
The computer would boot but is unresponsive. Not sure if this is an Asus or Windows problem.
Never Again MSI  It arrived with the audio much louder to the left and light bleed which appeared like someone was shining a flashlight up at the bottom of the screen on the lower right side. An hour with product support, who barely spoke English, and I was done. Never again MSI.
This is a terrible computer! It takes more than 15 minutes to turn on. And once it does it often shuts down.
Computer was corrupted. Stopped working after a few weeks.
I hate to say that the computer is too slow  I hate to say that the computer is too slow. I have to turn it off sometime especially when working with Internet Explorer. It is quite frustrating.
Hate it  They have found a new way of extortion...licenses...are you kidding me. I wanted this laptop until i spent one day with it. I do NOT want this period. Anyone want a new laptop
Do NOT buy this product  I purchased my dv9730us(dv9700) HP Pavilion entertainment system in Jan 08, in just 18 mo's I can no longer use it..the system over heats then starts shutting down. I have used a cooling pad with a fan, no help..once it starts shutting down it continues until you press the button to shut it down. I called HP but of course the system is out of warranty and there is no recall to date on this model. I paid over 1300.00 for it 18 months ago..HP says sorry we can't help you. When I did research on this I have found 100's and 100's of people with the same model and the same problem. I had to buy a new laptop, this time I bought a "Dell".No one can convince me HP is not aware there is a issue. So if you are thinking about this model, do your research!!!!!!
Bad hardware  It was a terrible purchase, the mouse was almost nonfunctional among other issues with other things.  Probably just the one computer, but it turned me off to that model.  Purchased an Acer and its blazing along.
it is NOT work good. The screen still flash  When I turn on the computer , the screen STILL FLASH,  like a traffic light. I can't use it properly, it's flashing make me dizzy. So I returned it
Definitely different, we'll see how it goes.  I am not a computer specialist. Just a business person (photographer) who needed a new laptop and giving my own personal opinion on things I notice on this computer that I think is important to note before buying.  * It doesn't have a optical drive (no  CD/DVD port).  I'm new to this so I cant judge if that's good or bad. It feels a bit frustrating for  the money, but I'm sure its for the best and I'll get used to the new technology (soon as I find out what that is).  I do have an external optical drive from when the one on my last laptop died, so I can still install my Lightroom and Photoshop (which Adobe doesn't sell my versions anymore so I need  the disc to download)  and other programs I have purchased in the past,  (I am curious what people are doing do download their products, if you want, please share)  * the screen is wide, and short, (Wider but shorter than my last laptop) just like a plasma TV, but the image of your programs and internet are really small. Browser doesn't fill the screen by default in all situations, and there is a few inches space on each side of the screen your viewing, it's more like viewing a window that is just a 7" wide space in the middle of the screen, and 3" empty space on each side. So it's more like like a 9.5" screen then a 15.6".  And even when it is filling the screen, everything is very small (good thing I'm nearsighted or I'd need a magnification glass to see the works I'm typing right now.  I am aware of hitting control and rolling my mouse wheel to enlarge but doesn't work on all screens) It reminds me of when I was working on a MAC at work, just a little bit more difficult to hover your mouse over the button you need to push (I know this is touch screen but I won't be photo-editing with my fingers ;P ).  I'm sure I'll get used to it, but I do tend to like bigger screen images and feel the space on the sides of the screen are a waste.  (I took a picture and will add it to the image section)  I haven't had this computer 24 hours. I'll add to this as I find more things about it I feel note worthy. The idea of it so far is cool, but not sure it will fit MY needs. We shall see.  6*24*2013 UPDATE: I need to read reviews on what other people say about the stock hard drive, but this thing is painfully slow and constantly freezing. Not sure if I have a bad copy or what the deal is, but I didn't know it would be THIS slow. I do have a Hybrid SSD on the way (actually ordered with the computer at the recommendation of my IT guy but it came DOA so waiting for the new one to come).  So if this is normal behavior from the stock hard drive, I recommend ordering a new one with your computer. I'll update performance once we clone everything over and it's installed. BTW this is the one I ordered if anyone is interested: Seagate 1TB Solid State Hybrid Drive SATA 6Gbps 64MB Cache 2.5-Inch ST1000LM014  7*2*2013 UPDATE - Man this computer is fast! I've been using it for about a week now with the new Solid State Hybrid Hard Drive installed and I'm very pleased. I'm still getting used to just the whole new turn in technology but I'm loving it more and more every day as far as the "that's cool" factor. Waiting for that "How did I ever live without this" feeling, but so far, feels like a regular laptop could be just as sufficient. However I will say one thing I can't do on a regular laptop, and  that is write a personalized signature with my finger on the screen for possible logo design (tho I know you can still create a logo with your signature).  One thing I do love (and cant wait to hear a professionals review on this type monitor) but as a photographer, I can look at the screen from any angle and it doesn't change my image. That's actually a pretty big deal, as laptops are generally unreliable to edit on because of the change depending on how your looking at your screen, and you can loose consistency in your image edits, and edit too light or dark depending on the angle its open or how your sitting. It's recommended to buy a separate, quality monitor for editing, but I'm hoping I won't have too with this screen, if I can calibrate my monitor to match my prints, then I won't worry about it with this computer (for now), then it will probably have the "cant live with out this" factor :)  7*3*13 Update: Maybe someone can help me with this. I have troubles staying connected to the internet when my iPhone and TV are still connected.  My screen keeps dimming then brightening periodically. I have set the brightness settings to stay consistent but it still dims, then a few minutes later goes back to the setting I had set it at.  And third, I read someone say the design is flawless.  It's a super cool looking computer, and I'm totally excited about it too, but IMO, it's not flawless. It's just a tad difficult to open (maybe my last laptop spoiled me) but this one does not have a lip to get your fingers in to open it, you need to kind of wedge a finger in there to get it open, and if it's not a good grip, it will snap back shut.  I personally don't like that because... well... I just don't like it snapping shut and jolting my computer.  But be careful and it's fine, I'm just sayin :) it's not flawless (and a USB port in the back would be nice for the wireless mouse. ;)  *9-3-13: Well it's been a few months now and if I could return this computer, I would. I have security on this computer, I don't visit any strange sites, just my usual (facebook, pinterest, bank accounts, gmail) And it runs good on startup, nice and fast, but I have to shut it down, I can't put it in sleep mode, or it will run very slow once I wake it.  My programs freeze and I can't "control alt delete" and pull up my task manager and end a program. The task manager freezes. My last computer force closed a program when I commanded it too and in any situation, it would immediately close the program. This one will not at all and I have to press and hold my power button and force shutdown the computer and restart it.  I set my brightness to High performance" so the brightness will stay where I want it. It still flickers dull and bright. And every once in awhile it will reset it back to it's default "Balanced" and I have to go in and reset everything.  I now feel this is a cheap version of a very expensive computer. I thought putting $1500 into a computer, that I would get quality, guess quality is more in the Three grand range, and maybe even has a name that starts with M. Oh and it's constantly dropping my internet when everything else in my house is working just fine. I have to restart computer to get it to work again. The F12 button sets the computer in and out of Airplane mode, I thought it would only activate it when you press the blue Fn key. I program F12 to run actions in photoshop, but periodically it will turn on airplane mode and I'm not touching the Fn key.  Then I turn off Airplane mode and it will still turn on when I try to run my action again. I hit sift, alt or control and it still turns it on and off.  Then to get my internet working - again I need to restart my computer.  * 9-25-13: I did figure out how to go deeper into settings and set the brightness control to not flicker even when on high performance.  Good luck to everyone else who has this computer. It's just not for me.
Too Slow!  This computer is much slower than anticipated. It takes too long to boot and at times very slow when changing sites. I have a very fast internet connection so that is not the problem.
Beautiful concept, poor implementation -- BUY SOME OTHER LAPTOP/TABLET DESIGN!  Great design for touchscreen and tablet-mode versatility (Sony's "Flip" idea is FAR better than the clumsy Yoga or x360 can offer).  HOWEVER -- backlight had problems within a month of use, which apparently cannot be fixed. Build quality in general has a lot of issues: power cord barely stays in, keyboard sags uncomfortably, plastic parts feel delicate, and flip functionality is easily broken.  Don't buy this junk. Wait for Samsung to come out with something better -- and feel confident putting your faith in that quality (and even customer service!).
Power Jack Malfunction  I've had this laptop just under two years. About a year ago, I sent it off for warranty repair because of a faulty power jack. Now less that a year later, the same problem is happening. Except this time, it is no longer under warranty, and will cost $110 to fix.
WORST COMPUTER EVER  First one was supposed to be new but received a used broken one that amazon replaced. The second one has been returned to ASUS for repair in two months and must call ASUS on a daily basis to get tech help to make it work. REALLY A WASTE OF MY PENSION MONEY. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO MY WORST ENEMY
Slow and without MS Office  For some reason, when the computer description said the Lenovo came "fully loaded", I just assumed it meant loaded with MS Office suite. Not so. It does have Open Office, which I have used, but which is not always adequate for creating the types of documents I like to use. Also, it does not really interface well with the network I have at work, so my coworkers cannot open the reports I have created at home. This is a rather LARGE problem and pretty much makes this computer useless for my purposes.
Stopped working nearly immediately
It was working fine and in the middle of using it  Literally 1 year and two months in, the left mouse button stopped working. Nothing abnormal happened to it. It was working fine and in the middle of using it, it just stopped.
IT WAS PROB. ME, I COULD NOT KEEP IT CONECTED TO THE WIFI
Two Stars  Good night, friend I have written several times .. the lapto get me but will not start .. we'll do in this case
Horrible  Horrible, just horrible.  Itd take half the page to explain all the problems ive had with this.  I got this computer for free through a scholarship, but honestly, I wish I had just spent the money on a better computer.  Now, the area where my charger plugs into is broken and I cant even turn the comp on, so I lost all of my documents.  I recently bought a Mac Book and LOVE IT.  Definitely recommend going for a Mac- skip the Dell!
Never buying Asus again  So I used to use my Toshiba Satellite for about a year until it broke down on me a few months ago. So I went to Officemax finally after school started and was looking at laptops when I found this. It seemed to be perfect: intel core i5, HDMI port, it was light ultrabook, energy star, had the number pad and a disk drive, it seemed perfect. So I bought it and was so happy when I took it out of the box. First few days were fine. Than it started to lag. Constantly. After the lagging started, I started to get disconnected from my internet at random times for a few minutes. Then I noticed that the battery only lasts about 2 hours until I have to charge it back up.  Mind you, the only things I ever have running on here not related to school is Firefox and IMVU.  Than today I decided to run uTorrent. Not only did the program run slow, it slowed down my entire computer and was constantly making it lag. I never had this problem with my Toshiba. Never had any of these problems with my Toshiba, and I had it for over a year.  So long story short, I'm very disappointed in this. I'm not sure if it's the computer itself, or if it's something to do with where I bought it, but I'm going to try and get my money back soon. So if you're thinking about getting this computer, don't.
Had it just over a year now, and it puked. Recovery discs don't work, tried everything I could think of, nothing.  So I ran it over with my truck
Do not buy this cheap, disposable ill serviced toy  Bought 2 of these for the kids for school.  Ratty little ankle-biting computer, temperamental and cheap, poorly functioning keys.  Screws fall out after 5 months (see photo)- good luck getting Dell to fix it, I have been trying to get replacement screws, but guess what - the cheap model and Service Tag sticker rubs off after several weeks (see photo) and Dell won't even look at you without the Tag.  Instead of buying this "computer" it would be easier on your sanity to take $200 and just burn it in your grill or fire-pit.  I am going to try a Surface or an Air next.  These cheaply made rattle boxes are not worth the time, and Dell does not support Chrome.
Nice for 9 months-  This worked for 9 months. I had to purchase two additional chargers ($30 each) and it no longer charges.
Useless
Not a good product to be buying  This is the second defect I received, It was a birthday present for my son. Well needless to state the thing is a defect. I believe he has made arrangements to send it back for repair or replacement. Not a good product to be buying!
Super slow USB transfer speed  Super slow USB transfer speed. My wife's five-year old desktop transfers at nearly double the speed with the same external hard drive. Avoid Lenovo stuff. Big disappointment.
Unimpressed  Battery is dead and will not take a charge. I would expect a little battery life degradation but this is terrible. Power cable arrived wrapped like I bought it used at a yard sale. So far, I am unimpressed with this purchase.
Don't buy it  I was excited to buy the Samsung Series 900 11.6" laptop.  I researched the product on numerous sites and it seemed perfect even though it was very expensive.  I was looking for a small, portable, lightweight laptop that was efficient, yet portable.  When the computer arrived, it seemed as though it was exactly what I wanted and expected.  However, soon it was obvious that the laptop was worthless especially for the money.  The biggest problem is that the wireless adapter is terrible.  It has a very limited range, doesn't keep a signal and is very slow if and when it does connect.  The laptop is supposed to be portable, yet it doesn't connect to the Internet.  In addition, the configuration is extremely difficult to operate.  Samsung and Microsoft have screwed up this product.  The software overrides basic functions.  I am very good with computers and own 2 other laptops.  I've been working on this laptop for 3 straight days.  Bottom line, the laptop is junk.  Don't buy it.  Its a nice concept and maybe Samsung will eventually improve the product so its functional, until then buy a netbook if you want better performance at a much lower cost, or buy a Mac Air or any other laptop for a better experience.  On top of all that, after I purchased the laptop online at Amazon, I received an email that the laptop is not refundable (this was after I placed the order, but before I received the laptop).  Are you kidding me?  $1,200 for a laptop that is junk?  The good thing is this is America, and in America consumers have rights.  If Samsung/Amazon do not give me a full refund, they will be hearing from my attorney, and based on other customer reviews I won't be alone.  Don't buy this laptop...you will be sorry.
Not up to the mark  As its i3 processor but bit slow processing. I have used other laptop with i3 processor but this one is bit slower comparing to oter brands in the market.
Not even 3 months & dead as a mackeral  I loved it until it died 2 months past the return window.  By 'died' I mean froze, then upon an attempted reboot - went into 'automatic hard drive repair' mode, then blank screen.  This laptop does not have a removable battery so disconnecting from power and removing the battery to start over is not an option.  At first I was enjoying an updated laptop with the ability to run the current MS Office Suite. Now I regret this purchase.  I'm back to my old out of date Acer that just won't die. It won't run the latest, greatest but at least it works.  Do yourself a favor and get something that works. I won't risk another Asus.
The laptop gives a continous static noise  I booted up the laptop and it started giving a continous static noise. This was not an intermittant noise and was present until the laptop was shut down. I am not sure if this is a problem due to defective item or a generic problem. I have asked for a replacement but until i receive a different sku , I will not be able to comment on it.
CRAP!!!!!...
DONT BUY!  DO NOT BUY THIS! This has NEVER worked right. Its 6 months old and the power button is no longer functional, the battery no longer holds a charge, some buttons you have to cram on. I unfortunately thought it had at least a 6 month warranty so now its been 6 months, and i have nothing but a POS computer laptop. This product shouldnt already be having these issues!
Three Stars  display and sound not good
I don't recommend anyone getting this if it's like this  I just got it today and well the furst time I turned it out it set me to settings but at the ends it goes black out on me. I don't recommend anyone getting this if it's like this. I don't even know why it does this everytime I turn it on. smh.
RUN AWAYYYY  #junk ... so this machine has been used only for projects meaning research papers nothing else absolutely nothing else!!!! ,, and has managed by its own will to successfully crash without fail every single day with minimal use ... iam here right now wondering if its gonna iam gonna finish this review.. iive only downloaded journals and pdf's ..  not even more than 20 .. save yourself the trouble .. spend the extra get something else ... anything else ..  buy a pen and paper its more reliable..  U WERE WARNED!!!!  disgruntled asus owner #pieceoffunk...
Would not have been my first choice if I saw it.  The product has a charger that does not stay together it constant separates. They keyboard was dirty and just not clean.
Very little bang for the buck  I thought I was getting a great computer for the price but so far, this one's just been a source of frustration. I'm the only one using it and hate that I have to sign on to my own computer with a password (disabling didn't work), as well as having to click through the app cloud just to get to my desktop. It has a ton of games and shopping related apps that I really don't care about, but the worst part is that I can't open any of my saved Microsoft files unless I purchase Microsoft Office! That's kind of a theme with this laptop: anything worth using you have to purchase separately. Since I use this primarily for writing-related projects, not having a decent word processing program--or one compatible with the files I already have  is a huge deal. Word 2010 came free with my last Acer and I now wish I'd bought another Aspire instead of this piece of crap.
Used it for 10 minutes worked fine. Picked it up a few days later and 7 or so  keys would not work. Spent time on the phone with HP to try to correct but I ended up having to send it in for repair. They have called me twice and emailed me saying there is a delay in the return. So I should have just returned it and got my money back from Amazon. I still may. I didn't buy a refurb but got one anyway.... well if they ever send it back to me.
Terrible software / word processing. Text jumping around screen not addressed by Dell  I have owned this computer for 3 months and am very disappointed.  White it is a decent computer, the software support for Dell is terrible.  A well documented problem with text frequently jumping off line and not being fixed by upgrades has left me -- and many others -- very frustrated with this computer.
The Macbook worked fine. We were not able to access to add or download.anything because the administrator pass would not let us. we called several times for it to be removed and the problem was not resolved. Everything they told us to do did not work.
HORRIBLE!!!!  The mouse keys stick constantly on day #1. I hope I can return it. I knew I should have bought another HP!!!!!
Do Not Buy... Piece of Junk and Dangerous Too  Bought this from Walmart a few weeks ago. It crashed almost every time I was browsing the internet for the first week I had it. Then, on Christmas Eve, it was not plugged in and during the start-up phase, it started smoking and burned a whole through the plastic casing and through to my leg. I have contacted Acer and they are not standing behind the product and are trying to explain why it was probably my fault. Walmart sent a ho-hum response and then, when I posted a customer review, they have chosen not include it on the product's page on their site. They will not respond with a reason why they have censored my customer review. This product is dangerous, Acer will not accept responsibility and Walmart (no news here) stinks.
This computer is utterly and completely a piece of crap! Save a little more and buy a decent netbook or better yet a tablet. I wish I had returned it while I had the chance. Do not buy this, no matter what other reviews you read!!
VERY disappointed !!!  This product was purported to have a Solid State Drive for max operating system speed as show below in quotes. This was the primary reason I wanted to purchase this item!  "Lenovo IdeaPad 700 15.6" Full HD IPS Notebook Computer, Intel Core i7-6700HQ 2.6 GHz, 16GB RAM, 1TB HDD + 256GB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce GTX950M 4GB, Windows 10 "  The item I received did NOT have a SSD. I am very disappointed in both Amazon and Lenovo!
lightening fast & so quiet  I love it But with all the research that I did I failed to notice that it doesn't have a hinge or any resistance. If you are in a situation where you can't use the kickstand, your screwed. you could never set it on your lap & the angle that you can get is extremely limited.
Windows Sucks - So does the hardware  I wouldn't recommend this machine to anyone.  Windows sucks and is slow on this machine.  I immediately went with a replacment OS Ubuntu 12.04.  Sorry 64bit doesn't work - it will sortof run i386.  Sorry 32bit doesn't work completely either, first the Realtec wireless would load and then not load and then not work at all.  The 13.04 install didn't work either, this time providing a black screen.  The EFI boot menu is confusing and not helpful.  Others have reported it as buggy with HP lines.  It's been 10 years since I had this much trouble with a computer running an alternative operating system.  I say, avoid this non-compatible albatross.
I have zero problems with the computer itself but the touchpad is absolutely miserable. Instead of having two separate buttons for left clicking and right clicking, the same button extends to both sides. You will frequently find yourself right clicking even when you press the left side. You cannot disable tap to click (believe me I tried) so you will find yourself accidentally clicking on buttons and exiting browsers.  It's too bad I have had no other issues with the computer but the mouse is so bad I have to rate it at 2 stars. If your going to use this like a desktop and have a mouse attached, I think this computer will be fine for you. If you plan to use it as a laptop, I would keep looking. The touchpad is really that bad.
Bad Quality for HP Keyboard  The "H" key on the keyboard doesn't work properly. The character "H" won't show up during the typing unless I hit it really hard. This happens consistently every day, and I miss the final return date by the rule from Amazon and cannot return it for replacement. HP has bad quality!
Stay away from this seller.  First review on Amazon. Bought this computer as a gift for Christmas (2013). Was used solely to browse the internet. Less than six months from the date of purchase the backlight for the screen and the hard drive failed. Contacted seller, never heard a thing from them.  Stay away from this seller.
not working well  twice a day sudently stop woking and i hace to reboot it  , is too slow,  i cant open more tan 4 pages on internet
Bought this laptop at the end of July. Didn't realize they do not supply a warranty. Motherboard crapped out at less than 3 months old.
Wasn't refurbished. Still had other programs and malware on it
Am disappointed with this computer it has a lot of scratches n dents and a big knife cut on the back. None of these was in the discreption.
Buy at your own risk  I purchased this notebook a year ago and out of the box the keyboard wasn't working properly.  It was intermittent and worked sometimes but as time went on, and it went out of warranty, it failed completely.  After spending roughly 3 hours on the phone with customer support, they were very responsive, they finally told me that it could be upwards of a $300 repair and because it was out of warranty, I'd have to pay for that.  As I didn't have time to send my computer out to ASUS and have it gone for upwards of 60 days, I decided to cut my loses and just buy another machine.  I have been an ASUS user for quite sometime, not laptops but routers and other equipment, but I will never buy another ASUS laptop.  It's too risky.  This review is not a reflection on this seller, just the machine itself.
Battery life is 4 hours not 7.25 h. The touch is stuck sometimes. May be I will return it.
I should be able to expect a brand new item to work  It probably is not fair to rate only the items that are flawed, but I buy a lot from Amazon and most things I buy are great.  However, I bought two Asus laptops and brought them to Africa.  On one of them, the charger stopped working almost immediately.  Although I have been told by Asus that it is covered under warranty, I will not be going back to the US until next June.  In my life, I have bought many computers, most of them HPs.  I have never had a computer that stopped working before I had a chance to use it.
Incredibly slow for an I7-6700. I wouldn't recommend it.  This laptop is incredibly slow for an I7-6700. It benchmarks as only 20% as fast as typical I7-6700  laptops, even with an SSD upgrade. It also clunky and heavy. I would recommend you stay away from this model.
Terrible Touchpad  The laptop is nice looking.  I like the back-lit keyboard.  It seems plenty quick but then the problems start. - The wifi connection kept turning off.  The only way I could restore it was to let the windows troubleshooter fix it.  It would tell me that the wifi is not enabled.  What? I enabled it five minutes ago, using the same troubleshooter application!  I look into it further and the problem is with "wireless console 3" which is an asus add-on bloatware.  I mess around with it and I think its stabilized.  For now anyway. - The touchpad is too big.  There is no way I can type on this thing without brushing up against it and moving my cursor around everywhere.  If I'm not careful I'll end up messing with the entire screen, zooming in or out etc.  The only way, really, is to hold my wrists up and out from the center of the keyboard. Not comfortable at all.  I'll continue to work with it and see if its something I need to get the hang of.  If not then I am going to try and return it.
Not for daily use  The headphone jack didn't work and microphone is poor quality.
doesnot have a camera
Don't Waste Your Money  Don't buy this laptop.  A waste of $200. This laptop is pretty slow--much slower than I expected.  I bought this a few months ago to use solely for my Master's program.  I put Microsoft Word on it (for writing papers), Google Chrome, and  Outlook for my college email.  I didn't put any other programs on it or save any files to the computer (I saved files to Google Drive).  Even thought I have barely put anything on this computer, it will not let me install the most recent Microsoft Windows update due to lack of storage.  I've deleted everything I can (the few files and programs I added), and it still says there isn't enough memory for the Microsoft update--which I feel could leave the computer vulnerable.  This, coupled with the slow speed, leaves me disappointed.  A complete waste of $200.  Don't waste your money.
Very disappointed  I bought this laptop NEW. What I didn't know, until I needed a repair, was that the Windows 10 that was included was the free upgrade from Microsoft over a Windows 7 installation. I've had nothing but problems with this machine, and feel betrayed that I wasn't told of this when I bought it. Now, of course, the windows OS has multiple "bugs", and I'm still trying to work them out. Being on a fixed income, buying extended protection was not an option. I'm saddled with this PC that I hate, and disappointed with Amazon for not being honest--I've shopped there many times before.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Asus-F555LA-AB31-15-6-Inch-Laptop-2-1-GHz-Core-i3-5010U-Processor-4-GB-RAM-500-GB-Hard-Drive-Windows-10-Black/dp/B011KFQASE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Asus F555LA-AB31 15.6-Inch Laptop (2.1 GHz Core i3-5010U Processor,4 GB RAM,500 GB Hard Drive, Windows 10), Black</a>
Do not buy  Do not purchase!!! I bought mine about a month ago and it literally crashed on me.. Chromebooks are not the way to go at all..
Your are much better off buying from their competitors  Never buy any Asus machine! I made the mistake of buying two. Both broke down within the (worldwide) warranty. It took them over one month to repair the first one. The second one is now with them for four months already. Nothing happens. Their call center keeps telling me that I will be called back, but it never happens. I wrote several mails to their customer relations on their worldwide site. They claim they will answer within 48 hrs. Not one single time have I gotten any answer. Your are much better off buying from their competitors!
This computer had good reviews but started having problems where it does not boot up. This happened after about 4 months. You turn it on and it gets hung up at a black screen. I wanted to blame it on the WIndows 10 upgrade but it did it prior to that.
windows 8 is real crap  I bought this laptop and then noticed it had windows 8 I thought it would be like windows7 or xp, but it is so screwy.it's a headach to use. it should come with a windows 7 or xp cd and I would like to know if they will do something about it. Darrell Caraway.  update i have now had this laptop for five mounths,it has crashed so many times,nothing works with it,and if i ever buy another pc it sure won't have windows 8
Cheap spacebar  The spacebar is really bad. I sent it back right away. This is absolutely a deal breaker. How this passed research and development is beyond me.
This computer is junk! It freezes constantly. I even had someone add more power to it, and it still freezes. I gave never had more frustration over a computer!
Hate it  I used to love my laptop in the beginning and now a few months later it gives me nothing but problems.. I had to send it into ASUS  tech support 4 times already. Touchscreen will stop working, I would get booted of the internet when all other devices would be running fine. The laptop will crash at unexpected times with no warning.. Definitely wasn't worth the $600+ that I spent.
This computer is so slow that it is close to unusable.  It boots up OK.  It is slow but reasonable with Office.  It is unbearably slow with emails, using Chrome or IE or Edge.  I would have returned it but the return window closed on me.  I suppose I will have to trade it for another brand and chalk it up to education.
Meh  Not impressed for several reasons. 1. If a gaming laptop comes with an old fashioned platter hard drive, it's not a gaming laptop. I ordered an M.2 along with this machine (Samsung Evo 950). It's hard to believe a platter HD is even a thought in 2015. 2. It doesn't last 5 hours by a long shot. I turned down the screen brightness pretty low, forced the intel integrated graphics to run over the discrete gpu, did only simple web browsing, and even turned the intel thermal software down to run the cpu @ 2.1ghz. I still got maybe 3 hours. The battery percentage in Windows said everything from 9 hours to 3. Nope. 3 hours max. I've used it in this way for several weeks. No where close to 5 hours. 3. The cheesy red light on the lid should have never existed. 4. Buggy video drivers. Lots of screen flashing. 5. BIOS is tough to decipher. Wasted a few hours in there. For those of you looking to do a secure wipe of the Samsung EVO's so you can enable bit locker to pick up the hardware encryption keys, you have to turn on the compatibility mode (I forget what it was called...it was an acronym that didn't really tell you anything). That will essentially disable the UEFI and allow you boot using your BIOS disk. Just remember to turn this mode back off before you install Windows. 6. After I wasted several hours figuring out how to get the SSD hardware encryption keys to get picked up by bit locker, after a reboot or two, bit locker lost them & turned off, and I could never get it re-enabled to pick up the hardware keys, it would only software encrypt afterward. I reformatted 4 times & this has happened every time. Still haven't been able to figure that one out. 7. UEFI mode doesn't support booting from CD/DVD. Again, you have to toggle that acronym compatibility mode I mentioned above to boot from the CD/DVD drive. 8. It doesn't come with an M.2 screw, and neither did the Samsung SSD I bought. Lame. Thankfully I was able to find a small enough screw on the front of an old IDE laptop hard drive that would fit. If you pull the platter HD out of this and think one of those mounting screws will work...it won't, they're too big.  The one good thing though is that it is easily the quietest machine I've ever had.  I bought this machine because I've almost exclusively purchased ASUS products over the years, and I wanted the Skylake architecture for the power savings. This machine hasn't delivered. I was pretty close to pulling the trigger on one of those MSI's....wish I did now.
The screen flickers all the time..hurts your eyes after a while
terrible laptop  I had this laptop for 10 days and it was the worst fast boot made it almost impossible to get to the bios nothing about it in the books it came with the NVidia drivers are terrible you cant upgrade the video drivers without getting a black screen at the windows logon screen you have to turn off the lap with the power button then turn it back on just to get to the logon screen the vent is on the right of the lap and the hot air that comes out is very hot so is the palm rest the cooling system just cant handle the heat fast enough!!!!!!!!! This is a gaming rig I DONT THINK SO this is the worst most expensive laptop ive ever bought. Toshiba QOSMIO x875 IS THE WORST LAPTOP IVE EVER PAID FOR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  BACK TO THE ASUS ROG FOR ME THEY ROCK
off and on  the screan  goses of and on off and on after 3 monthes no can use it
Battery life sucks, it's heavy.  I wish I could return and get my money back.
Good machine for the price with minimal annoying quirks [update: yes, has some very annoying quirks]  I bought this based on the reviews, here and elsewhere, glad I purchased it (I needed it fast), but kinda wish I had the time to have researched a few more laptops.  My previous laptop was a Gateway NV79 and I adored it.  It felt like a Cadillac compared to this one, BUT, the price was right and the shipping lightening fast so I bit the bullet and bought it.  What I like:  The price.  It looks good.  Faster than my old laptop.  Bright and clear.  Nice size, not too small, not too big.  SUPER long charge!  For that I should up it to 4 stars but still a little miffed over what I don't like (see below).  I may update later after I have used it longer.  Hopefully up, down down.  What I do not like:  Feels. ever so slightly cheap, but again, the price.  The space bar has to put hit pretty good or it doesn't space. Same with the key board.  The number lock won't stay locked.  That is driving me NUTS!  Windows 8.1 UGH.  Not as bad as some people say and I am getting used to it fast, so at the moment it is between "like" and "dislike".  I don't like not having all of my programs and apps (like a simple calculator) right at my finger tips,  but may get easier as I figure this version of Windows out more.  No right click bar!!  I hate that!  You have to tap at the bottom corner of the touchpad, finally mastering it, but I don't like it one single bit.  Can't figure out how to get Live Mail installed.  I tried it, but all it did was go on and on and never downloaded.  Will try again because I don't like web based email.  I know the NOT LIKE paragraph is longer than the LIKE but overall, for the price, it is a sweet little computer.  I am still grieving over my old one (went to the the repair shop a big beautiful, yet broken machine, and came back to me with the hard drive in a little plastic box *sniff*) so I most likely will grow to love this one too.  Just need more time.  I will update my review later as I find more good, hopefully no bad.  7/4/2017 UPDATE (long time coming but finally am fed up):  I have never had a computer that I had to re-boot so many times as this one.  It's been a blood pressure riser for at least a year now.  The wifi is so weak, the Asus laptop that my husband uses on the same sofa works fine.  Mine is constantly dropping and I have to re-boot to get back on.  And, the other issue is that the cursor freezes constantly and I yet again, have to re-boot.  I seriously want to toss this laptop out of the window, but can't afford a new one yet, so I have to play nice and keep re-booting until I can afford a new one.  I researched fixes and both issues seem to be common and just as frustrating to other Acer owners.  NOTE:  IF YOU WRITE A LONG MESSAGE OR POST, SAVE OR COPY EVERY SO OFTEN IN CASE IT FREEZES.  I HAVE LEARNED TO DO THIS LIKE SECOND NATURE AS I HAVE HAD TO RE-WRITE SO MUCH STUFF; HENCE THE REASON I AM CLOSE TO TOSSING THIS LAPTOP OFF THE BRIDGE BUT THAT WOULD BE LITTERING.
You get what you pay for--buyer beware!  It's working again
DO NOT BUY!! ASUS IS HORRIBLE!!  Do not buy asus products!! Beware!! After only a few months this laptops hd card broke, i sent it in for repairs. It took over a month for then to mail it back and fowarth and a week to just put in a new hd card. Once i FINALLY got it back, they didn't fix the problem, still was messed up AND they didn't send my adaptor back. I have contacted asus support line over 8 times trying to get them to send my adaptor back, STILL no adaptor and now its going on another month and they STILL haven't shipped my adaptor back!! Asus is HORRIBLE in their repairing & support. Out of those 8 times contacting them, 2 times they hanged up on me and i had to recall and sit on hold another 30minutes to be told the same thing over & over!! Will NEVER buy another ASUS product after 3 months of them screwing it up and stealing my adaptor. DO NOT BUY ASUS!!!
i recieved a macbook pro with wrong specifications....  too bad
Do not purchaser without a warranty  I've had my Asus G73JW ROG-A1B5N since February 2011.  Since then I've had to have it serviced once because of a cracked display, for which I have no idea how that happened.  That cost $600.00+.  Now the display won't work at all, even plugging in a secondary display won't work, and now the machine won't even come on.  Lesson learned, do not buy Asus, and if you do, don't buy a machine without a warranty.  This is the first time I've ever had any issue with a lap top and I can't believe I've problems twice on the same machine.
Screen came as broken.
Bad product  This product is very bad, don't have intel virtualization vt-x and also blue screen when I use android studio, and the drivers of intel say that don't response.
how much GB Ram is this tablet?
Ok but not what i wanted  Very, very slow.  Very.  Has locked up numerous times.  Black operating system box comes up randomly.  Froze up during last update for two days!  Would not buy this product again. Might be good for a child who has never been on a good pc but not for a student who depends on their laptop to work properly.
Dissapointed  Well I bought this product, not from amazon, about a year and a half ago. For the first 9 months this computer was wonderful. Unfortunatly about the third week of last June my video card started to fail and I've had half a screen of non comforming pixels. Well a few days ago the video card completly failed and now my computer is unusable until I get a new one. Secondly I wouldn't buy anything Toshiba because when this first happened I was still under warranty and called Toshiba everyday for a month trying to get help and they kept giving me the run around. I'd recommend an HP for anyone looking for a laptop because they're customer service doesn't suck.
DISASTROUS  I BOUGHT 3 OF THESE COMPUTERS, THEY RE A DISASTER:  -MICRO SD GETS STUCKED INSIDE, NO RELEASE MECHANISM, BROKE THE CARD READER!! -EXTREMELY SLOW TO BOOT AND TO DO ANYTHING IN THIS COMPUTER AND FULL OF BLOATWARE (I DONT WANT ANY APP INSTALLED NOR THOSE STUPID WIN 8 TILES). -MOUSEPAD IS A DISASTER, FINNICKY, RATTLES A LOT, INACCURATE, DOESNT SCROLL. -ONLY 2 USB 2.0 PORTS EXTREMELY SLOW. -SCREEN RESOLUTION IS IMPOSSIBLE TO LOOK AT. -CAPS LOCK LIGHT PLACED IN AN AWKWARD PLACE WHERE IT CANT BE SEEN. -CHARGER PLUG BROKE INSTANTLY AND ITS SO STRANGE THAT CANT BE BOUGHT ANYWHERE, WHY THE HELL DIDNT ASUS PUT JUST A MICRO USB PLUG??!! SO I DONT NEED TO CARRY ANOTHER CHARGER!!! -FINGERPRINT MAGNET. -WHAT ABOUT ADDING 2 HOLES INSTEAD OF ONE, FOR HEADSET??!!! ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A DECENT 1 HOLE HEADSET!!! -NON REMOVABLE BATTERY SCREAMS "PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE". -LETTERS ARE TOO SMALL AND THE SYSTEM HANGS AND REBOOTS ITSELF -IT DOESNT HAVE 32 GB OF STORAGE, ONLY 5 GB. AFTER ASUS AND ELSE BLOATWARE!!!! -I D HAVE PAID NO MORE THAN U$S 30 FOR THIS SH..., GO BUY A CHEAP TABLET INSTEAD... -COMPUTER DOESNT RETAIN SCREEN BRIGHTNESS SETTINGS, IT ALWAYS PUSHES UP BRIGHTNESS LEVEL, TOTALLY ANNOYING.
Run from this product!!  We bought 2 of these; use them only for internet access.  We have had to throw both of them away.
Displeased, thought it would be good.  I did some research and thought this would be a good computer for a little web surfing, email and an occasional Word or Excel document. From the very start it is slow and freezes up. Upon reboot it works okay for about 5 minutes. Even while I type this the text it is lagging behind. I went online with HP support for about 60 minutes and remotely they tried everything. It still performs horribly. It is also buzzing occasionally, not sure if it is the fan or processor.
BUYER BEWARE!!!  I bought this computer about a year and a half ago. It worked great at first. After a few months of basic use, it began running LOUDER and slower. The mouse touch pad doesn't work properly and when I type, some letters don't register. I have to keep backing up and retyping words. The battery died after 13 months. I have used many utility programs to try and resolve some of these issues but to no avail.
If I could if given a 0 I would have, the laptop came on and once we began setup the screen turned black. We kept it on charge assuming maybe it needed some juice. 7 hours later the screen remained black.
First bad experience with HP  The keys stick. The "enter" was the first one to stick. I was going to live with that. But after a week, some other keys started to stick also. I return it. There might be problem with the keyboard design. If it is not for the keyboard, it's a nice computer.  Also, it comes with malware that make the Firefox not function normally and a lot of pop up windows. I had to use a malware removal program to get rid of all these. Then the key started to stick. I know the malware came with the computer because it was like that from day one. I installed Norton 360 before I even start using the internet AND I only gone on my usual forum only.
LOUD!!! a very loud fan.  Dells tech support stinks.  Comparing to all other laptops out there, this seemed a very good buy.  But WOW, what a loud fan.  So loud is is close to a hair blower noise level.  THEN there is Dells tech support.  Humans yes, but trained like a robot.  All they want to is track you. Track you track you.  You give them the service tag, yes I registered the machine, so they have all the information on the server.  Can we just get a human to be a caring, understandable, wanting to help fix the problem type of BEING?? Hope the old / New owner, Mr. Dell, can fix this!!
poor support, Windows 8  Slow, poor support, Windows 8.
Very bad not starting at all  Hey Team  The product i purchased and it was fine initially,now its not even starting  Please let me know the process  Thanks Praveen
Arrived fine but when I started to load software it died.
CAVEAT EMPTOR  I have had this product for less than one month and it has crashed twice so far. It keeps getting stuck in a loop updating, without booting. Word to the wise, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM
and it is not a good machine at all  I have this laptop model for work, with 8G memory and the 2.7GHz processor, and it is not a good machine at all. It boots quickly (go solid state HD!) but it freezes often, and is unresponsive to alt+ctrl+del. I work with large spreadsheets and the crashing is annoying, and results in lost work with the hard reboot. The keyboard is terrible - the keys are completely flat and you have to really slam them down or they will not type. It does not have a keyboard light, nor a good place to pick it up with one hand while it's open. Really, compared to the Lenovo I had before it, it seems like a super cheap POS.
poor  its slow and it kicks me of my sites does load all the time to all others do not buy this pile invest in something better
This is not a technical review but service review  First, I want to note that this is not a technical review but service review. I purchased ASUS N550JK laptop on Amazon because of the excellent reviews on Amazon and on other sites and forums. Since I'm not a resident of the US I made sure before purchasing, that I have a international warranty. My first use was about six weeks from the date of arrival and the experience was excellent and impressive. On the third use I started noticing screen burns of previous windows (that appeared on the screen earlier). Since then, the screen's display rapidly deteriorated. The screen's color, saturation and brightness was completely distorted to the point that I could not use the laptop properly or even to watch the screen without feeling sore eyes and headaches. I immediately made contacted with ASUS local service center in Israel, where I live. I won't bother you with details of the multiple service failures I've experienced and just state in conclusion that the service I got was extremely appalling including call hangs up, decline of service, providing false and misleading information and rudeness from representatives and couriers. I must note that my laptop is currently in the repair shop for the following week. I will gladly update whoever's interested in follow up.  Maybe it's a really good laptop in general, but when you buy a laptop especially for work purposes (like in my case), you must have confidence that when you experience major failures or technical difficulties  - you have a service center you can call and  and be reassured that you'll get all the help you need as fast as possible. That's what the big brands promise you ,anyway. I'm sorry to say that wasn't the case for me. So if you think of purchasing an ASUS laptop, do a quick ask around for the service center customer reviews.
Fz-180e Huge Issue  Ok I'm gonna go be quick and sweet with it.  This computer is not even Sony built.  First off the thing will melt cheese it gets so darn hot.  Second off If your impressed by the amazing screen you are seeing DO NOT THANK SONY.  THE SCREEN IS MADE BY Samsung.  Yes the sceen is made by Samsung.  I found that if a chair falls on the screen it breaks.  I am fixing it myself and I repeat you are buying a Samsung Screen in a Sony Name.  Don't buy this computer unless you like paying more cause it says Sony or you want the Blu-Ray player.  Otherwise it works as a great with the HDMI output.  I have already had mine overheat and blow a harddrive, my disc drive, and my fan.  Consider yourself warned.  Yes, Yes, I know I am probably one of the lucky few.  But if you own this and have for sometime your lieing if you say it doesnt get hot sitting on your lap.  Sony told me not to use it on my lap on at a desktop station.  Its called a "Lap" top for a reason Sony.  Build em so they work.
works like poop  this is the worst computer i have ever used, its slow, it has to be reloaded every time i open the internet, maybe its just cause im used to macs and this is a pc but i sugguest that no one should spend their money one a acer. save your money and get a better laptop.
I am returning this Item and wouldn't recommend it to anyone  When I received this Item it was a lot smaller than I wanted. This Item is not what it is advertised. I am returning this Item and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
Sometimes buy used  because it's cheaper is not always best spending those couple of more dollars in some cases does make a difference lesson well learned. Thank you anyway
Does not install Android Apps from Google Play. Don't waste time  Does not install Android Apps
...slow start up...not fond of windows 7  Should have bought a tablet for my wife with instant access as opposed to the slow start up and shut down of a mini computer......
BEWARE! THE LAPTOP HAS A DESIGN DEFECT!  I purchased a HP Pavilion TX1000. Within 12.5 months the laptop completely failed. The symptoms are as follows: (1) the wireless adapter fails and is undetectable; (2) the video fails; and (3) the computer does not boot anymore.  I purchased a new wireless adapter to install. It did not work. I plugged an external monitor to the video card, but it did not show an image.  HP knows that their is a design defect with this laptop, specifically the nVidia chipset that they use. The laptop overheats and destroys the motherboard.  DO NOT BUY HP! They have refused to acknowledge its design defect and have refused to help any of the costumers who have wasted upwards of $1200.00 USD from purchasers! In fact, I have written to the CEO's office twice and to no avail, they have refused to help me. They claim that their research group has not identified the TX1000 as a problem and refuse to recall the product or investigate out problems! They are liars, cheats and crooks!
Overpriced, won't last a year  If you are looking for an overpriced computer that works for 4 to 6 months and then ceases to be able to run its own startup process in under 10 minutes, look no further. This thing was used to run one program, never put anything extra on the hard drive, and it is still somehow like it's overloaded. Acer support's solution is to just hard reset the computer every couple months and then it should work fine again for awhile.
Number pad stopped working the same day
For Those Who Don't  So I posted this on Lenovo's page after my experience with their on-site tech today. I'm going to just keep posting this everywhere I can find.  Lenovo; For Those Who Don't:  January 23rd I received the IdeaPad Y510p from Lenovo, and it ran like a dream for 13 days, then I go to take my dog outside and put my laptop in sleep mode and come back in and it won't turn back on. I called in and had the option to return/refund it or repair it. I went with repair in hopes of being able to keep my data and awaited the box that tech support said I would be receiving in 3-5 days...  It's the motherboard that needs replaced; power light turns on but the fans, hard drive, keyboard lights, screen, and even USB power are unresponsive. A $1,649 paperweight.  20 days later I call back, having been busy with two jobs in Advertising, furious. I found out that it was never sent out and that it was just kind of forgot about. So you kindly "escalated" the repair to an on-site request after you said it would take almost twenty days for a repair and I would still have to wait, that you thought I was sending it in a second time for a second repair, and that you said I couldn't refund it until I told you I talked to a Sales Manager and they said I could and you looked into my history and found I actually did talk to someone and I could due to the situation.  Well that on-site guy THAT YOU SENT OUT came today and broke the laptop even more. He lost one screw when taking it apart, forgot to put two screws back in, broke the bottom latch/lock for the laptop, part of the frame (a little plastic clip on the inside but it looks warped now) and was banging the laptop, jabbing it with his plastic tool, and kept saying "I sure hope I don't broke it, don't wanna do that!" I took pictures and cringed the whole time. I about had a stroke watching this guy "try and not break" my laptop. AND IT'S STILL NOT FIXED. It's just been sitting on my desk since I got it.  This is a work laptop. I not only make money on this laptop, I spend money on it monthly for my software. I make $18 an hour at the job I got this for, and it has cut back my time there drastically. I can't work there I can only work from home. I was averaging about 3-5 hours a day until the laptop broke. Now I get less because my home computer isn't meant for this work. The software is $20 a month that I can't use. My freelance pays $30-$60 an hour just for design fees. I've lost more money because of this laptop possibly than for what it's even worth.  You better get back to me soon. You have my case number. You have my name, phone number, and email. If Lenovo is for "Those Who Do" then what you need to DO is start making up for what you DON'T DO. So do something right for once and call me.  This laptop has not only cost me time and money, but now it's cost me my patience.
Make sure they will give the Activation Key with the software!  Computer didn't have a legitimate Windows 7 activation key. Also the driver for the internet adapter wasn't installed or was corrupted, item returned.
Not Worth It  Ordered this to replace a 4-year-old Gateway which still runs fine.  I just wanted a bit of an upgrade in horsepower.  After doing some research, this Acer seemed like an great bang for the buck.  Brand spanking new i7.  Discrete graphics card.  I was excited to try something more modern, and maybe actually play a game or two that were released after Half-life 2 (the cut off of my last laptop's capabilities).  Let me start with the good.  The design is pretty nice.  Smooth, sleek, silver.  A little heavier than I would like, but not terrible.  It does have a lot of bells and whistles, especially for the price.  The aforementioned discrete graphics card (GeForce 840m) is surprisingly capable with a lot of newer games.  I was running Skyrim, Bioshock Infinite, and the latest Tomb Raider on mixtures of medium and high settings at playable framerates.  The audio also surprised me.  I'm not even sure where the speakers are located on this thing, but especially when paired with the built-in Dolby Home Theater software, the sound they put out is the best of any laptop I've ever had.  But enough niceities.  Let's get to the reasons I only gave this one star.  First and foremost, the display is abysmal.  The screen itself has a finish I can only describe as "textured."  Not sure what the point is or what Acer was thinking, but it results in there being a smudged-looking appearance at various points around the screen.  At first, I thought maybe there was a protective film I didn't remove or that the screen needed cleaning.  But nope.  It's apparently made that way.  And it's distracting, especially against a white background.  Which is especially unfortunate since I do a lot of writing.  The quality of the picture itself is also lacking.  Black levels are almost nonexistent.  And no matter how much I tweaked the settings, color reproduction just always seemed a bit off.  The display issues were enough to have me considering a return, but I thought maybe I was just expecting too much.  But the final nail in the coffin came a couple days ago, when I started experiencing random performance problems.  I first had trouble with stuttering during video playback.  It would get better if I rebooted, but inevitably happen again.  Then, everything seemed to slow down.  My mouse would limp across the screen.  It would take forever to open folders and files.  Not sure of the problem was the hard drive, processor, gpu, or whatever, but I gave up.  The only saving grace is that this happened inside the return window, because that baby is going back.
Buy something with a better brand name.  I don't know what came over me when I bought a product made by Acer.. its only been a year and its already falling apart, I use it for a couple of hours like every 2 to 3 days. Pros/ it's fast as expected and after a year the software performance didn't degrade.  Cons/ 1- finger print recognition is a hit or miss 2-the back cover of the screen is falling apart with every time I open and close the lid, I can see the electronic parts every time I attempt to close the lid 3-WiFi stops working a least once every session and I have to manually reset the WiFi module to have it work properly again 4-the screen flickers randomly about two times every use and it gets worse when I move the pointer, I'll have to close the lid and open it for this phenomenon to stop. 5-one of the not-so-many USB ports disconnects without warning or any physical stimuli. 6-at certain angles of the lid the color scheme (my terminology could very much be wrong) is reduced and it becomes very obvious if am watching a video as the quality of the picture is reduced greatly. 7- some of the keys on the keyboard are mislabeled such as the increase and decrease brightness. 8-many other cosmetic and quality fails such as fallen bottom plate pads and others
Does not work  This website description is not trustworthy. What comes in the box is not what you expect. False information described. I ordered this item thinking I was going to get something, well at least new for the price I pay, and it turns out it was used. Someone's account was already registered in the system and there was nothing I could have done to fix it since I was not contemplainting that, after all it was new as I thought.  Words of advise, read very careful all the information described before you go and purchase this item. And even if you have read it, double check because it may not be true.
Cheap flimsy, overpriced.  Junk Dell. Never Dell again. Keys too far, have to reach.
Underpowered Bay Trail processor  I just bought one of these (the 4GB full HD model). I was very disappointed after running the Octane performance test a few times. This HP gets around 8,500. My much cheaper and much older 2GB Acer C720 Chromebook with a Haswell Celeron kicks it's butt with scores around 13,500. These HP Chromebooks have the "Bay Trail" version of the Celeron. Don't be fooled. Not all Celerons are created equal. The Bay Trail is an under-powered tablet-style chip. The HP Chromebook 14 is a fan-less design, because the Bay Trail does run cooler than the regular laptop chips. So it's silent. But you trade a lot of performance to get that.  Update: I just decided to return this. While I initially felt the build quality was pretty good, I encountered two problems... 1) After switching to a dark wallpaper, I noticed a definite "screen bleed" in one of the corners where the backlight was leaking. 2) The battery drained almost entirely dead while the lid was closed overnight. I am under the impression that the thing should be asleep and not consuming power when the screen is closed.
No not buy for school  Probably the worst idea i ever had. I bought this just for college to send emails to professors and do some homework, etc.  Its so slow and i cant even manage to open emails because the files are too big and this was right when i bought it.  I can't answer an email and look up a word at the same time because the computer can't handle that.  WTF?  It did not come with a mouse like it said.  Absolutely worse thing i spent my money on.
Stopped Functioning Completely after just a month and a half of ownership!!!!  I've had this laptop for a month and a half. After minimal use, only for email and photos at this point, the thing stopped working completely.  It doesn't even power up.  I can't return it because the deadline passed a few weeks ago.  $600 for nothing!!! It is the worst product/ experience I've ever had with Amazon.  I took a gamble buying a laptop online, and it failed me. I don't care what positive experiences others have had with this product, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Very, very upset and disappointed.
Ordered 2 laptops and in both units the battery would not accept charge. I researched online and no matter how many steps I research and tried, still would not accept charge. Returning both.
Worthless  This is the only thing my son asked for for Christmas.  It will NOT stay connected to the internet! Worthless for gaming. Technical support not open the day after Christmas. One star because it does turn on.
New Laptop was used and stolen  The laptop was great. The hard disk crashed after 2 months. Dell refused to recognized the one year warranty. Dell said the laptop  was not new and the laptop I bought new from Amazon was a stolen laptop from a company in San Jose. Since it did not crash within the Amazon 30 days return period, there is no recourse. I now have $700 in laptop parts sans a hard disk. You can check with Dell to determine if you are the valid owner of the computer.
Also had issues with the display, just outside of warranty.  Unusable.
BUYER BEWARE.  I ordered this computer, and it has never worked properly.  Although I spent a lot on all of the specification items for a high performing machine it came with a terrible, and basically not functioning video driver that cannot handle basic 3-D modeling.  My other Lenovo came standard with a much better video driver.  The company OEMGenuine, the company who sold it put me off to Lenovo who replaced my motherboard, updating old drivers, etc.  I have spent A LOT of time working with them with not result; the machine still has the same issue.  I DO NOT recommend buying anything from a company who hides cheap internal items in an expensive laptop, and then will not help you.  It should be replaced as it is a machine I use for my work, and plan to keep for a long time, but it is ineffective at anything beyond the simplest tasks.
The network is sooo bad that it often disconnect
***Don't BUY FROM AMAZON! Buy from Apple Store!!!  There was a dust inside the screen. I thought it was something that I've done, but I just opened it in a dust clean environment. I want to exchange it on the Apple store, and the lady said I have to return it back to Amazon.  Absolute worst experience for a beginner. NOT SATISFY.
too old computer  only last 3 months, but not surprise since it was an old computer, hard disk needs to replace it + technical fees, i will just buy a new one
Operating system doesn't work  I bought this laptop 1 month ago an I can't enter to the operating system. It said a message like: "PREPARING AUTOMATIC REPAIR", I don't know what to do.
Dell Defective laptop Motherboard  This is a very bad laptop from Dell. I bought it  just last year on Thanks giving offer. Already it's motherboard went defective and laptop did not switch ON after that. Luckily i got the warranty and Dell replaced the motherboard for me. I am hugely disappointed that Dell is delivering below par products like this. I never had problem with a lenovo laptop which i bought back in 2011,its still running good ,only i replaced the battery. I will not buy anything from DELL hereafter. I hope the changed motherboard will work for another few years.
Problems from the beginning with this machine, now......  purchased this laptop sept 4 2017 and right from the start it had all kinds of annoying little things going on with it reminiscent of other laptops I,ve owned just before they died! Then on or about dec 24 2017 I ran across a Lenovo notice that my 1 year warranty is up in 49 days. So my "1 year warranty" is only half? Now today wed dec 27 around 12:30 pm I got the ol' BSOD. It shut down and restarted with the black screen  and the "start windows normally" option. It restarted with the old "windows recovered from..." box. Is it on cue to die just after my shortened warranty is up?
I was expecting more from Samsung  Pros: 1) Good value 2) Relatively attractive appearance 3) Fast performance - I bought this to handle somewhat complex functions in excel, and it has performed very well 4) Reasonable battery life - about 4 hrs from my experience  Cons - to be honest, I probably wouldn't be writing this review right now if not for these disappointments: 1) First one I bought had a broken sound card or something (the sound was making a terrible sound and would not stop).  Samsung replaced it pretty promptly, but still... 2) I've owned it for just one year, and the keyboard has started to malfunction.  One day the "e" and "v" buttons will stop working, the next they'll be fine and the "t" won't work, etc.  Samsung has no updates to fix this. 3) Poor responsiveness / placement of the trackpad.  The trackpad will often click in strange places while I'm typing (because your hands have to naturally rest on the pad while you're typing).  Additionally, the scroll function of the keyboard is very unreliable.  Overall, the processor and things having to do with actual performance have been great, but the peripheral functions have obviously been lacking
Hard to get repaired  My battery failed 10 month later of purchasing. And there is no service center in Texas. I need 1 month in total to get my computer repaired. I have lots of jobs everyday. How can I live without a computer for one month???  Plus, I could not start the computer properly since one month later of my purchase. I need to spend 30 minutes to start it sometimes. And recently, the battery totally failed.  The speaker is not as well as it describes, too.  The graphics cards could not change properly as well.  Though it is said that the battery would last for 4 hours when I bought it, it is actually only last for 2 hours maximum. Mostly only last for 1.5h or shorter.  Compared to my old Thinkpad computer, this one really sucks. I selected this computer because I think ASUS was solid notebooks. However, this wrong decision brought me so much troubles in this year.  This one seems to have very good performance, but it just cannot always work all right and bring dozens of troubles!  I've done with ASUS!!! I suggest everyone to choose thinkpad(not ideapad) or Mac. Though they are expensive, they do not bring you troubles frequently and easy to get repaired!
over priced shipping and the key covers come off to easily so im forced to glue the red caps to the keys
incredibly SLOW  This laptop is incredibly slow and I'm in the process of returning it.

The laptop died and will not power on due to a motherboard issue. Warranty is void and this is a defective part and HP will not repair under the warranty. Stated we had to pay $400 to have it fixed. Save your money and buy a Dell instead. Better service, long life of product and all around better deal.
This computer would have been nice if not for the extremely slow processor  This computer would have been nice if not for the extremely slow processor. The computer hangs noticeably when doing simple things like opening a web browser, navigating to the control panel, or opening the Start Menu. Really, I should have spent an extra $100 and gotten one with an i3. I cannot explain how frustrating it is to perform a simple task like opening a RAM stick or web browser and having it hang for 40 - 50s.  By the way, this computer has been fully updated and no other programs are running at the time when performing the actions mentioned. If you don't mind constant hanging when only running one program them this computer is a good deal.
... is my 4th HP laptop and by far the worst. It is slower than any in the past  This is my 4th HP laptop and by far the worst. It is slower than any in the past, takes long periods to load even simple documents, and the finger-pad for the mouse freezes often. I have had it for a week and want to send it back. And FYI, no CD drive.
Just awful!  This computer overheats constantly. I have to have it on a cooling pad with 2 fans for it to work properly. It sits at 147 degrees instead of 120 like it should. It hard-shuts-off at 182 degrees.  Vista is awful so I'm glad I purchased Windows 7.  All in all its an okay computer I guess, if you don't mind it overheating and losing your work. I would not buy this machine again, or any other Acer for that matter.  The speakers have a very low volume which makes it impossible to listen to most youtube videos and music on your computer. You have to plug in headphones.-- Even with the volume at 100%.  I've delt with this stupid laptop for 2.5 years and I've finally given up on it and am giving it to a techy friend to try to fix and buying a Dell. I've never had any problems with a Dell before so I'm looking forward to receiving it via UPS or Fedex this week.
Small size: low performance.  Hello, I bought this as a replacement to a 2015 Macbook Air 13.3" 128gb, and wow, I was majorly disappointed. I owned this for 3 weeks, and used it on a 75mbps internet connection.  *Pros: This is a slim, lightweight laptop.  *Cons: See below. *Battery life: ~5hrs with google docs open, mild internet browsing (mostly dropbox and google drive). This is nowhere close to the estimated 10 hours. I think they are getting 10 hours for idle time. For example, when my computer was left on during my professor's lecture, my estimated battery life was 9 hours. Then when I started typing notes, the time went to 3 hours. *Trackpad: This does not offer non-linearly scrolling. If you swipe fast with your two finger gesture, the page does not scroll any faster. Windows 10 also does not have an option for you to adjust this. You can only toggle how many lines at a time you scroll, which just makes scrolling really jumpy and erratic. The trackpad also does not follow your finger well. I will often try to click a link or a tab, and I will miss. However, if you have a mouse, this issue is avoided. Also, sometimes the cursor would end up in parts of the screen that I did intend for it to go, and I do not know why. I never had this issue on my Macbook. *Performance: Mozilla Firefox and Chrome load pages in a choppy fashion. If you try to do any actions while a webpage is loading, the computer fails to respond and lags. I was able to play League of Legends at the lowest settings with only minor lag, so this has same limited gaming potential. For example, when I went to scroll down the Amazon page for this laptop, it lagged while scrolling, and all I have open are 4 other tabs in FireFox...  Bottom line: I would not recommend this to students or professionals. The computer is not reliable, and the little hiccups interfere with workflow.  Note#1: I am not an apple fanboy. I have built two gaming PC's for my wife and my friend; however, I have been using a MacBook Air for the last 3 years, so it has become my benchmark for laptop performance. Note#2: I bought the MacBook Air 13.3" 2015 model for 749.99+tax in May 2015, so, I am not comparing the UX305FA-USM1 to the regular price MacBook. Note#3: If you have a Microsoft Store and an Apple Store near you, I would suggest you go play with this laptop and then the Macbook Air, and see what I mean.
Battery died shortly.  battery died shortly. It should last longer.
It is not worth the money.  13 months and 2 days after we bought this laptop, it died.
Not worth the money  Runs insanely slow, takes at least 5 minutes to load up, and always opens spotify when it turns on
First impression: awesome.  Next Impression: DO NOT BUY ACER.  Please read the follow up, after this paragraph:  Bought for a gift, but I went in and setup, cleaned up junk and updated first so I got a little experience with it.  For a netbook, it has very good power.  Didn't ship with too much junk software, and overall feel of keyboard is good.  The only gripe is that there is only ONE RAM slot, so I had to yank the 2gb out to put in the 4gb stick (23 bucks here on amazon).  It has a space for the second chip, but not the holder.  It did boot up slowly on the first run and updates were slower than a regular computer, but running the web and basic tasks were better than any other netbook I've worked with.  The gigabit ethernet port is a nice touch, and Wifi worked perfectly.  The larger screen is a plus, making it somewhere between a netbook and a small laptop (closer to a netbook) in performance, size and feel.  Good choice for someone who wants a "baby laptop" and finds 8" netbooks too small. --------- Follow up: The screen quit working, but it works with an external monitor, two months old.  Ok, it happens, just inconvenient.  So I go to their website, fill out the form for a warranty claim and wait.  Couple days later, I check up and it was closed out, no explanation.  Can't call them, so I "chat" online with a tech, who basically tells me that they thought I must have cracked the screen so it wouldn't be covered, so they just closed the claim with no notification or explanation to me.  They made me send TWO different photos of the unit, to prove I wasn't lying, all while in chat.  Now, I'm an IT manager with over two decades experience, and I'm familiar with how to properly debug a system and fill out a warranty claim.  This was a case of simply closing the claim hoping I would just buy another cheap system from them. IE: The company must be telling employees that this is the preferred way to deal with warranty on network: deny, then accept.  Long story short, they are going to fix it, they are paying all transportation, and I am not likely to ever buy an Acer product again.  Do not buy.
NO CD PLAYER  This laptop does not come with a cd player.  In this day and age that's like buying a TV and special ordering color.  Very disappointed.
all i got was a rock !!!  sorry guys the unit I received had major program defects.when you open up the program for the first time you are suppose to pick options and time zones and other brand new computer program questions. many thanks to the good people at amazon for refunding my money.
GREAT Amazon experience, POOR Apple quality control  Lovely looking computer.  This model shows slight UI lag in OSX, even when compared to other, older Apple models.  This model is also plagued by loose components in the screen (and/or speaker grille area) which produce a knocking/rattle sound.  Not sure if this will lead to functional issues in the future, beyond warranty coverage.  I had a GREAT experience with Amazon buying this product.  APPLE is to blame for what I see as poor quality control relating to the production of this laptop.  I returned this laptop to Amazon and bought another from Apple.  The one from Apple also developed the same problem.  I am typing on the laptop from Apple now.  If you think you might return a laptop, buy directly from Apple.  They make returns easy.  Amazon also makes returns easy, but I wouldn't hassle them when Apples returns are just as convenient and it's their responsibility to eat the cost of selling defective products.  Wonderful Amazon experience, poor product quality control from Apple.  It's a gamble: if you think you'll get a good one, Amazon is the place to buy this laptop.  If you think that you might need to return due to defects, then buy directly from Apple to save Amazon the trouble of cleaning up other people's messes.
DONT HAVE THIS
Dead hard drive after 1 day  I received the laptop, set it up and worked with it for a few hours.  I turned it off in the evening and the next day when turning it on it would not boot.  The hard drive was dead.  Back it went.
A huge pain in the A...  I would have liked to give this laptop 1.5 stars but I have to round up to 2  Pros: -Very light -Thin (very sexy) -Screen resolution alright -Speakers are pretty good too -The keyboard is easy to type on. The trackpad is so-so. I tend to use a wireless mouse more often anyway -Battery life is good. Lasts for about 5-6 hours working only on Microsoft Word at the lowest brightness and with light web browsing  All these combined allowed me to give the ultrabook 2 (1.5) stars  Minor Cons (resulting in 1 less star): -A lot of bloatware (not too much of an issue but it is annoying) -Of 128 GB there is about 60 GB free when you get the computer out of the box. Apparently this is something you can fix if you Google the problem but since this is not my main computer I haven't bothered to look into it -Samsung has the most mindless power settings which you can change so again, no biggie -The machine I have has only one 3.0 USB port and one 2.0 USB port (which were for some reason bent and it took a little force to get my USB drive into either port. They work fine now though) -To decrease keyboard size some buttons (e.g. 'Home', 'Pg Up', 'Pg Down' and 'End' buttons are on the arrow keys) requiring you to hold down Fn to make them work -The power cable connects very loosely to the laptop and falls out if the laptop is moved -It is not a touchscreen  Major Cons (knocking out 2 (2.5) stars): -It comes with Windows 8 pre-installed. You could change this but as it is the operating system is horrible -WIFI!! This is the worst part of this computer. The wifi is terrible on this machine. It has trouble picking up signals and constantly disconnects. When I am using public wifi there are times I cannot go online at all. I looked up this (well documented) issue on-line. One of the fixes I tried was:   1) Type in  'Edit Power Plan' in the Start screen search box   2) Click 'Change advanced power settings'   3) Select 'Wireless adapter settings'   4) Then 'Power saving mode'   5) Set both 'On battery' and 'Plugged in' to 'Maximum performance' This did not solve my problem but since it made it slightly (ever so slightly) better so I left these settings  After having a Live Chat session with a Samsung Tech (as I write this review) I made a another change which *seems* to have worked:   1) Hit the Windows button and 'x'   2) Click 'Device manager'   3) Click on 'Network adapter'   4) Right click on the wireless network adapter listed there   5) Select 'Properties'   6) Click the 'Power management' tab   7) Deselect 'Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power' If it does not work I will probably post an update  Conclusion: It is a beautiful machine. On their own many of the issues this machine has would be tolerable. However, all together the amount of fiddling and troubleshooting you have to do to get this machine to work the way you want it to (i.e. the way it should for $1000) really is not worth it. I have not bothered to include my problems with Windows 8 in this review (cue obscenities directed toward Microsoft) but combined with the 'kinks' of the machine it is impossible for me to recommend this ultrabook to someone.
Worst computer I've ever had the misfortune of owning ...  I bought this laptop because it seemed like a good deal, and it had a light up keyboard, which I liked, as I spend much of my time writing papers in the dark. I've currently owned it for a month and a week, and it hasn't worked properly since I bought it. It's always had a problem with freezing up, and now I'm getting the "blue screen of death" as soon as I turn it on ... despite never having used it for anything other than Microsoft Word. I haven't downloaded any programs to it, and have taken nothing off. And yet the hard drive is fried? I also have issues with the build of the computer (as if it's broken hardware wasn't enough!), it is VERY cheaply made; the entire keyboard bends a little when I press a button, and the screen gets those little dots when the computer is touched from behind. It is also off balance, so when I type a key on the left, the entire computer flops up and down. Needless to say, I have wasted over $600, and I will be returning this laptop as soon as I can. It is awful.
Not good  woest screen ever. Washes out. Speakers also are static when fully on
Mad at this buy  Got this laptop a week ago and have been trying to use wifi but to no avail. This laptop is giving me hell and I have no way of contacting the seller. I am so pissed at this. Tried everything so far. If this laptop continues with this issue Im returning ot

The hardware sounds great on paper, but the overall experience is terrible.  The first laptop I received had performance issues that were solved with a clean Windows install, and the fan buzzed every time I picked up the laptop. For some reason, entering the BIOS was enough to get the system fan to spin up.  The second laptop worked well out of the box, but driver/firmware issues seem to plague the device after a few weeks of usage.

[Image below] * The laptop would randomly not power on unless plugged into a power source. This may be caused by charging over USB-C instead of the regular AC port. * I'm running Windows 10 Pro with Bitlocker, and completely draining the battery was enough for the TPM to lose the drive's decryption key and require entering the key again. * The camera is in a terrible place. My left hand covers about 15% of image when I'm typing, and the angle (up the nose) is not flattering. * When I use the touchpad, there's a random high-pitched sound. * The enter key squeaks about 25% of the time.  I'm giving up and returning the second one too.
VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS LAPTOP AND WITH hp CUSTOMER SUPPORT.....SAVE YOUR MONEY!  I was excited when I received this HP lap top on 7/16/2013......just 4 months later I'm at my wits end!.....11/15 I turned on this LT and received an error message "please install operating system, operating system not found" and a link to HP support(which I could NOT access from this LT)........after many phone calls to HP I was sent 4 CD's to install a new operating system .....it failed to load 3 times.....I was then instructed to return it for service and received a FedEx pre paid box to do so......It was accepted by HP support on 11/22 and I was emailed a return date of 11/29......On the evening of 11/27 a lady from HP called from India(?!?!?) and told me it wouldn't be returned until 12/13/2013.....she didn't know why and when I asked for her supervisor she said no one was there but to call 800-474-6836 and I would get a supervisor.....after being transfered between 3 Indian people and a total of 68 minutes on the phone an Indian lady finally told me to call on Friday(11/29).....I did and no one answered the support line after 25 minutes so I hung up.....I called again today, Monday 12/2 and the support line automatron told me to call back later......I did and I did get someone.......after a half hour of me explaining and he making excuses I was told I would get a call back "shortly".....that was over an hour ago.....This was the 7th or 8th HP computer that I've purchased since 1999.....the last two b4 this one were just "OK"......this one is pure garbage and so is HP's customer support.....needless to say I will NEVER BUY another HP product............
You buy Thinkpad for consistency ...  Consider all the reasons you buy a thinkpad 1. Sturdy built-to-last frame 2. Trademark touch-pad and keyboard layout/look and feel 3. Easy end-user hardware repair and upgrade  Well thankfully with this model Lenovo has done away with all these useless business features and instead produced a 'cool' looking facebook/email machine.  There are several new "features" that really appeal to customers who have been using the T series for years - Specifically: 1. The giant trackpad. You wanted to left double-click that Icon on your desktop? how about I open the metro interface and load an "app" to upload photos to facebook instead? That's useful right? 2. The build. I have used every thinkpad since the T20 and this one is probably one of the most 'bendy' of them all. I really enjoy this feature, especially since the laptop not longer sits evenly on a flat surface just from the apparently extreme stresses that have permanently deformed the frame from being placed in a bag. 3. The 16GB cache. I'm not sure what its caching - but it certainly isn't anything relevant because I can barely run a single ubuntu virtual machine with 1 GB of RAM allocated to it. I have a T400 with a SSD that reboots in a few seconds where it takes this thing about a minute to restart from the "cache". Seems like a nice idea but in practice doesn't appear to help at all.  But there are some upsides: the T440s still has legacy VGA output support (seriously, this is actually one of the best features of this thing - you will be able to get your presentation up and running one way or another). The battery life is decent - this is mostly attributed to the very low power 4th generation intel chips though, not any genious from Lenovo. It does still has a keyboard, ethernet, and usb ports. However, I don't expect to find any of these on the next 'cool' thinkpad that comes out - maybe the next model will be a mac wheel throwback?  Honestly this model looks and feels like some C-level at Lenovo got paid off to drink the windows 8 cool-aid and made as many changes to accomodate the new operating system. Its almost as if the poor UI integration seeped right into the hardware integration.  I've had many thinkpads over years ( T430, T420, T400, T61, T60, T42 etc...) and this is orders of magnitude worse than all those other versions. The thinkpads always have the best hardware on the market - but the T440s is the worst when it comes to user experience from the T-series. Try again Lenovo - but next time don't try so hard to change everything your customers have come to expect from your products.  If Lenovo released a T430s body with the T440s hardware I would buy it in a second - no questions ask. Until then I'm never buying another Lenovo product again. They took something great from IBM and completely destroyed it.  I've had this laptop for several months and have been consistently disappointed.
Noisy fan! thumbs down  Performance wise this laptop is good except it has one major flaw - its fan is always on and is too noisy. This is a known issue and Lenovo recommends a BIOS update to fix it. But it does not work. [...] I would not recommend this product. I returned it within 2 days!
I bought this thinkpad X1 Carbon around last Thanksgiving. I was very thankful that Lenovo started to make a PC laptop that rivals macbook air, and even upped the ante a bit (on processing speed).  I do not do heavy-intensive computing or graphics... My usage is limited to some UI development (Webstorm, Javascript, Angular), PPT, Excel and browsing.  Everything went great until I hooked it up to a Dell U3014 UltraSharp 30-Inch PremierColor Monitor. The laptop has a single HDMI port that is a total lemon. It works when it wants to. And outrightly refuses to when it doesn't. There isn't it one thing you can do about it.  There is nothing wrong with the monitor or cable. My work laptop T420S (Thinkpad again) has no problem. My friend's ipad air has no problem (same cable, same monitor port). I sent it to Lenovo for repair. They promptly repaired it and sent it back. It worked for three days. And now it stopped working again.  I am so let down by Lenovo, that my $1900 turned into a total lemon.  I cannot recommend this laptop to anyone... since most of my friends want to use the laptop with an external monitor when they are home or at their desk. And this laptop cannot support that. So look elsewhere.
Very disappointed - whether it is the fault of Dell  Very disappointed - whether it is the fault of Dell, Windows 10, or Dell's adaptation to Windows is beyond me. In one (of two) regular locations, the computer could not connect to the wireless router until I rebooted the router - no other devises in the home had this problem. It has rebooted spontaneously, shut done incorrectly, and frozen up, requiring popping the battery in order to unfreeze it. It has trouble recognizing the external monitor which I rely on for color consistency when editing photos. It does not recognize external hard drives plugged into a USB3 7-port, but recognizes them immediately when they are plugged into a USB2 - which is plugged into the USB3. In my other location, it recognizes the external hard drives plugged intoUSB3. What strange thing is it going to do next. I have had it for about a month and have come to distrust it. I expected much better, and got something much worse.
GARBAGE  So you are paying 1900 dollars and it doesnt even work. Now sent to MSI RMA service and waiting for repairing. COMPLETELY TRASH.
headache from day 1  Day 1 recieved item in a timely manner/ Day 2 had to send to Asus for repairs (1) did not down load all the drivers,(2) could not make a back-up disc because it had no partition,(3) would keep getting black screen and could not shut down,had to take out battery to shut down!  then had to pay fed-x for box to ship item but Amazon refunded me the cost!!! thank you  Recieved lap top back in 7 days, tried laptop again! this time (1) hard still did not have a partition, so no back up could be made and (2) touchpad stopped working, so 4 days later the laptop was sent out again! and 7 days later it returned! Asus replaced the hard drive this time and did something to fix the touchpad!! but the story does not end there! Its past the 30 day return time now and to some reason i decieded to campare what i bought to another Asus, Well the hard drives that where replace only add up to 671 and it had a 750, also came with 12gb installed memory and now it only has 8gb installed memory so now i have to find out what Asus will do about it (IF ANYTHING)<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ASUS-G53SX-DH71-Full-HD-15-6-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Republic-of-Gamers-Black/dp/B005PAJHU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ASUS G53SX-DH71 Full HD 15.6-Inch Gaming Laptop - Republic of Gamers (Black)</a>
Was not in the best condition after I started working on it. The screen has lines going down it.
8 months and it fried or something.  8 months and took a dump. The charging light comes on solid white and turns off. Will not respond with the power button at all. Very depressed over this.
No no no no no no. Bad buy.  No! This IdeaPad is clueless. The ON OFF button broken after 1 day!!!  It is a product that was a good idea but made to break. I returned it and bought a KINDLE FIRE with a keyboard case instead. Am totally happy.
Basic under-powered and under-featured machine.  OK, I will give you the good and the bad.  The good: It's inexpensive.  The bad: Everything else.  It has just one USB 3.0 port and two USB 2.0 ports.  No bluetooth (REALLY???)  The keys are not backlit.  You cannot use this in marginal light (such as using it for a media PC).  The power button is exactly the same size and shape as the ESC button, and it is very close to the ESC. This has led me to inadvertently shutting down my laptop on MANY occasions. I have ordered some white Liquid Paper (remember Liquid Paper?) to paint the power button.  It comes with just 4 GB of RAM, and it MAXES OUT at 12 (you can add an 8GB card, but not more).  REALLY???  It does not support dual-band WiFi, but only the much slower 2.4 band.  The MiraCast performance is completely unacceptable, even with an Asus-brand MiraCast HDMI receiver on the other end. The video is OK, but the audio is insanely bad. This is with the Comcast WiFi receiver ten feet away. I have ordered a dual-band USB WiFi adapter, with 5.0 support. This may mitigate the MiraCast problem, but it adds a FOURTH USB component to my laptop (which has only THREE ports). So I just spent EIGHTY BUCKS on an IOGEAR wireless USB 2.0 adapter that interfaces with my WiFi system. And I don't even know if this will work. I have ALSO ordered a Twisted Vines 25-foot HDMI cable, so I can ditch MiraCast if necessary. It seems like a step backwards.  The maximum native screen resolution is 1366 x 768. The laptop supports a second display (including MiraCast) at full 1080-P. If you plan to use the laptop like a laptop, using the built-in screen, you should know that you will have less than 1080p HD resolution. You can use a second display at 1080p, but you can't duplicate the displays in HD - you can extend the displays or use only the second display. I prefer to duplicate displays, and I can't do that in HD.  The CMOS is CRAP. I went from three stars to two stars because of the CMOS. I'm used to being able to configure EVERYTHING. This laptop is nothing like that. I wanted to disable the annoying touchpad. I use a MOUSE, and never use the touchpad, but I am always touching it as I type, sending my cursor to unexpected places.  Can I disable the touchpad in CMOS? NO. Alas, I am learning to have a "wide stance" as I type.
Poor quality product & worst warrenty support  I bought this laptop and HDD crashed in 2 months. Contacted HP support and sent laptop for repair. Since 3 weeks no response from HP support. Poor quality product.
Computer has been blue screening on me and I've had to send it in to be repaired by Asus multiple times because they cannot seem to actually fix it. Very poor customer support for a laptop that I bought less than a year ago. I would look at other other companies for a gaming laptop.
Horrible Computer: -Wifi never remembers connections and has trouble connecting every single time -Settings do not save after sleep -Slow since brand new with almost no programs running or even installed. -Keyboard often doesn't register all characters typed  If you do not need an OS for specific programs, I recommend a chromebook anyday
NO  keyboard went out, touchpad went out, can't sense the power connection anymore.. this is after 2 1/2 years of ownership with light use.. pure garbage
bummer  maybe it was just my luck but it got defective on me twice so had to return, Amazon saved me!! i wouldve cried if I couldn't lol. don't mean to scare anybody it worked awsome when it did, just didn't last! ;(  UPDATE,Ive searched and searched and searched for another good laptop for a good price!! and no luck!, thers 2 other acer for 50-60 more and I think im going to reorder this one again! :( so heads on on a semi cheap laptop, if you want it to last, get square trade coverage here in amazon! which is what Im going to do, other wise it'll probably last me 2 years or less. Its so worth it if you don't want an expensive laptop right now! I wish these other people would answer their reviews! haha.
crash crash crash
broken  the item arrived broken. I sent back the acer to get fixed and it got damaged in shipping.  I had insurance on the package but ups wouldnt pay on my claim since Acer open the package instead of refusing and sending back.....  The computer was a birthday present for my fiance and I still do not have a working computer.  Very disapointed would have loved to have had the computer
Missing the discrete graphics card  The description for the laptop states there's a separate graphics card. The laptop I received doesn't have a graphics card in it.
Webcam is a mess (software woos)  My webcam doesn't work!! I'm told to back up my data (recovery disk) so they can reset to factory settings. Ughhh
Had an Issue  The trackpad wouldn't work properly and no amount of Chromebook Ninja help got it fixed. Had to send it back.
Don't buy this..... had it ...  Don't buy this.....had this notebook less than a year and the system kept shutting down at random times....researched online and found out that many people had this problem. I regret spending my hard earned money on it!!!!
MIGHT AS WELL THROW YOUR MONEY IN THE TRASH  MY WIFE WANTED ONE OF THESE NET BOOKS AND WE DROVE 100 MILES ROUND TRIP TO GET ONE. I CAN'T GET ON LINE WITH IT AND I AM SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO THE WIRELESS ROUTER. I HAVE TRIED TO CALL CUSTOMER SUPPORT FOR TWO WEEKS AND CAN'T GET ANY ONE TO ANSWER. THE E-MAILS THEY HAVE SENT ME ARE NOT VERY SPECIFIC. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE SIGNAL IS EXCELLENT AND YET IT WON'T WORK UP WITH OUR ROUTER. I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR AND FOR 99.00 YOU GET A CHEAP LESSON IN THAT. LUCKILY I HAVE SAVED THE RECEIPT AND WILL TAKE IT BACK. SPEND AN EXTRA COUPLE OF HUNDRED BOOKS AND GET GOOD USED LAP TOP YOU WILL BE BETTER OFF AND IT WILL DO MORE.
Pieces of junk
Lenovo warranty is worthless  Screen started randomly flickering after about 2 weeks.  Customer support tried to fix it remotely but they could not.  I sent it back for repair at my expense.  So far they have had the laptop for over 2 months.  They are still waiting on a part and there is no ETA.  I have called and they escalated the problem.  The case manager was supposed to call me the next day (2 weeks ago).  Didn't happen.  I have emailed him 3 times.  No response.  If you are buying a laptop because you need it for school or for work, then this kind of a delay will not be acceptable to you.  So you might want to think about whether you want to buy a Lenovo product. If you google "Lenovo screen flicker" you will get lots of hits.  Sometimes it is software.  Sometimes it is hardware.  Anyway, if you like dealing with customer no service, then buy this product.
Take a long time for the Contextual Menu to show up when I Right Click on a blank space on the Desktop. It literally take about  5-7 seconds for the Menu to show up,same when I try to create a new folder. other than that it runs good. Also I found out when its on and I close the screen and reopen it the screen dose not work goes black and never goes back to normal unless I restart the laptop and Also came with 97 gb ssd not 128g ssd 40 gb only left on it . this is a rip off
Frustrating  I cannot open 2 websites at 1 time.  It will not connect to the internet when I tried to activate my microsoft office 2010 account.  I should have bought a $300 Acer like my wife.  About all I have is an $1100 door stop.
wtf windows?  just a few things i'd like to note. it came very well packaged, very professional looking. not sure what version of windows came installed. i booted it up, connected it to wifi and that is where things went nutso. went through setup process and was unable to create a user account, or a microsoft account and was stuck at the user creation screen. unable to get past it. went and created windows 8.1 reinstall media... came back, finally managed to get past that screen somehow (no idea how, it just kinda did its thing and next thing you know i'm logged in to some garbage account i didn't set up)  the interface was completely broken. its like it tried to install windows 10 and failed. no icons. i am able to access certain things, like control panel, etc... but i have to right click on the start menu. cortana seems broken, not that i care its useless anyways.  when i pulled up the about computer page, it says that it installed windows 10 32-bit. thats a huge pointless thing for me. it has an intel atom capable of x64, so INSTALL x64. no reason not, the only reason i can think of is maybe due to the RAM only being 2gb? still seems silly to me.  anyways, the installation media i created via USB doens't work. won't allow me to install 64-bit from the desktop setup, and on top of that, i can't boot to the USB for some reason. I might wipe it and just install linux honestly. just sucks because Windows 10 would be perfect for what this was supposed to be used for, a basic media center for my kid in his play room. i suppose linux will do, just wanted a unified UI so he, and my wife, don't get confused.  hopefully i can get it to boot to linux. maybe i'll try swapping to linux then reinstall windows 10 from that... assuming i can get the USB to boot... it has the option in the BIOS jsut seems to go blank screen then boots to the messed up windows 10 install.  **UPDATE 1; 21 MAR 2016** managed to "repair" windows 10 using my USB dongle-- but only 32 bit. was unable to get 64 bit to work. just would not boot from USB. also, had to fiddle with the BIOS slightly. saw someone recommend turning off "Secure Boot" and this did help.  all in all, i'm in, i'm using windows 10. right out of the gate, there was some stuff that windows defender was complaining about. be sure if you get this, run a good scan across it and/or do not use it for important info like credit card info etc. i'm not sure if the copy of windows is 100% legit (obviously)... my uses other than for a media access point for my sons play room, i may use it for tuning my vehicle which us running a Microsquirt ECU. just need to get a small screen and bluetooth keyboard. if i find any other issues i'll come back and update my review.
Garbage laptop AND seller  Bought it in June/2015 for a grad gift and it was never a great laptop, but for the low price point that was somewhat expected.  What was NOT expected-  It is now December 2nd and the laptop disconnects from wifi constantly.  It is VERY slow.  But the worst part: It shuts down/restarts on it's own.  (think right at the end of an online test and no progress is saved)  It is used strictly for school work and has Norton Anti-virus installed.  I have gotten no response from the seller.  KILLS me when a company won't stand behind it's product.  I mean, at least have the guts to TELL me I'm screwed.  Anyway - it's garbage.  Don't buy it.  And the seller is garbage as well.
I tried contacting customer service to resolve the dead pixels issue but they were completely useless. They offered me the optio  I ordered this laptop thinking I would get something of high quality and reliable durability. After 2 months of owning this laptop I already have a patch of dead pixels across on the right side of my screen. I have done nothing but take the laptop between rooms and open and shut it but apparently that is too much for this poorly crafted piece of machinery. I tried contacting customer service to resolve the dead pixels issue but they were completely useless. They offered me the option to send my laptop to them for 2 weeks WITHOUT a temporary. This is not an option for students who want the best of both worlds both gaming and working because customer service will leave you high and dry when it comes to keeping you productive. Never in my life have i experience customer service that does not give you a temporary when they give you an inferior product. Additionally, customer service warned me that if i send it I should back up everything in case they have to wipe the thing clean. So not only would I be out of a computer for 2 weeks but also need to buy an external hard-drive if I don't already own one?? And there's no guarantee you'll fix it?? Umm yeah, no thanks. Now I am stuck with a damaged screen and no way to get it replaced under the warranty they so generously gave out. Thanks Dell.
probably would not buy again. Difficult to power up as start button thinner than a dime, and must be pushed quite deep into case to engage. Requires use of fingernail. 8.1 op system attempts to funnel all your activities through microsoft access Bought as Christmas present for wife. Did operate about a week when unit went down. Seems as unit did not have upgrades and required some fiddling to get it to come up where upgrades were installed.  Edit 4-20-15  Have made several attempts to get satisfaction with ASUS warranty folk. I did post a second review that seems to have disappeared in which comments were made about the failure of the unit. Multiple attemps to contact warranty repair department. The first time, responding party at number stated they were not the warranty people. The second time, was told it would cost $100, then $200 to repair unit that was less than 3 months old. Today, was transferredto department handling transformers, and held for 21 minutes before disconnecting.  88
Refurbished computer, it was listed as new,warranty expired after 6 months and extended warranty not valid, ie for new computer  A refurbished computer was finished. The warranty is expired (a few months after I purchased since it was not the full year). I purchased an extended warranty which is for a new computer. So Squaretrade warraaty  is not valid,  would appreciate contact from seller
Great machine; wonderfully light and reasonably powerful  Great machine; wonderfully light and reasonably powerful.  2 stars because mini-HDMI had all sorts of problems so I cannot drive big monitors with this machine - apparently I am not the only one with this problem.  I found a workaround but, as a long-time owner of multiple ASUS laptops, this is the first time that quality has  let me down.
Stopped working after 5 months. Paid to get it repaired and discovered that the speakers had blown while not being used & that it runs as slow as a laptop from 2005. And that is after I updated windows, ccleaner, malwarebytes ect... just pissed away $150 to repair an unusable $600 product. I'll never buy Dell again and neither will anyone close to me that has witnessed this abomination. After much deliberation I had purchased based on all the great reviews! I see now that they took a 180' turn after my purchase. This has been one of the few times that Amazon reviews have burned me. I feel defrauded.
Get something with real memory if you do more than email or surf  Waste of $$
Dell Laptop  Within a week of purchase, the computer shut down-hard drive issues.  We contacted with Dell about the situation by phone.  Dell attempted to resolved the issue overnight.  When they contacted us-by phone-the following day, the issue was yet to be resolved.  Dell supplied us with a shipping box (they paid postage for package return), and we returned it to Dell the next day or two.  Dell contacted us earlier this week (less than a week after sending the laptop back to Dell) to let us know the part needed to repair the computer was OUT OF STOCK!  After more than a weeks' contact with Dell, they know the problem, yet did not have the replacement part?  Why were we not notified about that earlier?  We purchaced the Dell laptop because of its quality reputation.  I suppose we'll think twice about that next time we purchase a computer. So, a WEAK TWO stars for the computer.  However, Dell's customer services was very helpful and prompt with following up the situation.  Also, having Dell pay the cost for return was helpful!
WIFI Problems and Horrible Customer Support  I got this computer mainly for online video gaming League of Legends, Counter Strike Global Offensive, and left 4 Dead. While this computer is great when it comes to running the games but a stable internet connection is not what this laptop gives me.  I have already checked my Wi-Fi and it works fine on everyother device my family has. I called Asus support and they left me with 1 option and that was to pay $249.99 for software help and in the words of the operative "A great deal!". I eventually found out that it was my wireless card that was causing the problem and I had to flip the wires as they were incorrectly installed. That fixed that for a month, where now my laptop shows that there are networks to connect to but will not connect to them. I still do not have any idea on how to fix this problem.  Pros: Good Laptop for intensive games Nice back-lit keyboard  Cons: Wifi problems Horrible customer support  I would not recommend this laptop or this company to anybody.
After a month the computer started beeping loudly 5 times on startup. I was able to replace the cmos battery and everything seemed to be going well. However, about two months later it started freezing every thirty minutes or slow. This is a horrible issue because sometimes I have to upload work online I get issues and end up missing a deadline or losing data. Please just spend more money and invest in a better laptop.
The computer I recieved was NOT as advertised. Firstly, there's not even a battery in this computer. The webcam software and other apps won't open. It's in a continual update cycle. It is not windows 8 as well. This I am completely unsatisfied with this purchase and I'm hoping for some recompense.
Bad quality and even worse tech support. Very disappointed.  I bought this product that came with a faulty lid. It restarts instead of waking up whenever I knock it slightly with the lid closed.  Sent the unit back to ASUS with an RMA number for repair. I received it yesterday from ASUS. I tested it and it has the exactly same problem. Nothing was repaired!  They didn't even bother to test it before sending back to me.  I wasted my time and shipping fee for nothing!  I will never buy another ASUS product again.
Daughter's Christmas was ruined  Complete piece of junk.  Finally booted up and get a message stating I have the zues .
This has been the worst laptop I have ever owned  This has been the worst laptop I have ever owned. There are do many bugs and issues. The touch pad is constantly inoperable, then the computer flips out opening and closing windows and not letting me use the touchscreen to operate the laptop. When I went to complain to the seller I couldn't find them on Amazon anymore. So now every time I use it I am just waiting for the lsptop to flip out on me. I'm stuck with a $500 mistake! I would not recommend this product or my original seller!
Nothing but problems  The overall quality of this laptop is poor. It is made with weak plastic. Sometiems when I lift it up I feel like the screen will snap off. The first tiem this laptop died on me was right after I got out of class, its screen suddenly stopped working. I hooked it up to a external dispaly and it worked, meanign ti was probably something wrong with the screen. I rma'd it and found out it was a bad motherboard and they had none in stock and I'd have to wait longer for the part to come in. The second issue is the itnernet adapter tends to be glitch and always has an annoying popup. Third issue is overheating. After receiving it back from their "motherboard replacement" It started hitting the 80C's quite easily(Even after I reapply the thermal paste). Not to add that the hindge covers were very loose after reciving it back from them. Screen qualtiy is crappy and I've had problems with the mic. After they replaced the motherboard I Got BSOD's and then they requested me to format it. I formatted it then started having issues with SCM. I'm not too amazed with the GT70 either. Power Brick buzzes sometimes On the side note, my GT70 2OC-065US runs with 16gb of ddr1600 and 1 SSD and 2 1 TB HDD with a caddy. Since its so heavy. its easy for you to accidently knock the power charger head a bit with your knee while lifting it up(Really have to wonder why they put the power socket on the back than the sides) this is probably why other manufacturers don't keep their charging sockets directly on the middle of the back.... After this experience... I Wouldn't recommend any msi laptop to a friend.
They are crocks, thieves  This product is the worst expirence I have had from amazon, I am wondering you amazon will allow such crocks to advertise their products. The computer will not turn on 10 mins after unboxing wow am shocked! PLS DONT BUY YOU WILL BE VERY HURT. Its painful that I have to wait to return this product before I can get work done. DO NOT BUY !!!
Stopped working after a few weeks. No help from support as it was after the 30ays. Struggled for weeks with HP. Absololutely atrocious service. Worst service I have ever encountered online and most probably offline as well. Stll have no resolution - cheaper to junk it and buy from Apple. Pity there are not negative stars.
I feel disappointed about that  I found 2 cracks on the laptop after I got it. Although they are not obvious, I feel disappointed about that.
Totally dead screen in just a week of light use  I purchased and received this computer on June 2nd. This is meant to be as a gift to someone back in the Philippines. The only thing I did when I received it was to setup her account and install a couple of software that she will find useful in her studies. Everything appears to be working fine then with no issues what-so-ever. So the next time I visited the Philippines (2 weeks ago), I brought it with me as a carry-on so it wouldn't get mishandled or thrown around. After a week of light use (and just when I'm already back here in the US), she sent me a message telling me that the screen stopped working. It flickered then it died. No amount of restart can fix it. I even provided instructions on how to get into recovery mode hoping that it's actually a software issue and not a hardware one to no avail. Now, I am hoping that warranty will be able to cover it and that Dell Service Center in the Philippines will be able to fix it at no cost. I still need to do a bit of a research where the closest Dell Service Center is around her area. I will give an update if this ever gets fixed or not. I just looked at the one-star reviews and it appears to all point to the same defective and flimsy screen.
Sucks......
Power adapter won't stay in , Boo Hiss! :  I bought the LG gram 15Z960 i7 15 Laptop (Gold) . Like buyer ar458 , The power adapter won't stay in . I spend a whole day setting it up , but the power adapter kept falling out . I'll fiddle with it one more day , but I want to send it back right now . If I can't trust it , I don't want it . Boo hiss !
Meh.  I don't like the interface at all. Not easy to Navigate. Small.... All things that are a personal preference but I usually end a session using this computer in frustration. DO NOT get this if you are hoping to use it for any extensive design or illustration projects. ...Oh and now its blocking Google... who blocks google???
Not a good laptop and won't recommend  1. Forcefully need to buy McAfee. If I try to uninstall McAfee it doesn't allow me to. Options are never get selected to uninstall. 2. Can't upgrade to Windows 10, not sure what the glitch is. Not a good laptop and won't recommend.
Freezing issues that make computer useless  My G73JW had a freezing issue pop-up after owning it from amazon for 2 months. I've done considerable research on the internet and found this to be a common problem. Purchase a ASUS product AT YOUR OWN RISK. Now i have to figure out how to fix the overpriced paperweight or return it for a substantial loss. Thanks ASUS for screwing me out of my money.
Didnt like it, WIFI problems  have a lot of problems with WIFI
White screen.  I can't really do any review here because I just opened mine and plugged it in. Screen is just white. I need an exchange.
Not A Good Buy  I know it's a certified refurbished but it came with a part missing, alot of stratch, the battery dies quickly, not impressed
Hate the Windows 8!  Worked for about 2 months now requests activation key for microsoft. also won't recognize any Network connections.
DO NOT BUY  This is without a doubt the worst computer I could have bought.  The tablet feature only works one orientation, you cant do it in portrait mode.  The issue is the computer defaults to portrait when it is in tablet mode.  You must press the EXACT sequence of buttons in just the right amount of time to turn the screen to landscape.  If you don't press the right buttons or quickly enough it reverts to portrait.  I could live with this if it weren't for all of the other awful features.  The speakers are unbelievably horrible.  You think I'm exaggerating but I'm not.  They put out barely any sound and the quality is horrible, cant tell what song is playing without headphones.  A few minutes ago the keyboard stopped working for no reason.  I saved what I was working on and rebooted, issue is the computer takes, no joke, 10 minutes to turn on.  After the 10 minutes are up it looks like its ready to be used but its not, it must be given another 5 minutes to be completely ready to be used.  If anything is clicked in those 5 minutes it simply does not open until the 5 minutes are up then 100 web browsers open.  The pen only partially works, the eraser only works in some applications, the buttons on the side are more of a pain than help.  I had to turn off the buttons on the pen because i kept inadvertently pressing them resulting in unnecessary right clicks and erasing.  Save yourself the frustration and buy a different computer.  Unless you are REALLY going to use the tablet a lot don't get a tablet.  Get one of those little pads that you can write on that plug in via USB, saves you about $500-$1000 and you can get a much nicer computer with a much nicer display(touch screen makes the screen grainy btw).  Absolutely no redeeming qualities of this piece of junk.  The only reason I gave it 1 star is there isn't an option for 0 or .5
Beware: This is sold by THIRD PARTY, not from ACER  I purchased this because I thought it was an Acer refurbished product.  Most OEM refurbished products come with original packaging, but this did not - so I was a bit wary that the charger and laptop came naked in just a box.  But it was when I saw and read the 90-day warranty that comes with this that I realized there is some bait-and-switch going on here. This product is serviced, liquidated and sold by liquidation.com, not by Acer. The warranty reads: "The product you have purchased from Liquidity Services, Inc...." The warranty is not Acer specific but is a generic one that also covers eMachines and Gateway computers.  I didn't give it 1 star because the laptop seems to work. But something goes wrong the next few weeks, this is probably a good reason.
I had such high hopes...  On paper, this laptop couldn't be beat for under $1,000 - Intel i7, 6GB RAM, 1080p HDMI, etc. But... received my XPS 15z today and it has faint vertical lines accross the screen - making the image slightly blurry. Also, the WiFi adapter/connection is horribly slow; connects at 86Mbps, while my other computers connect above 240Mbps (Wireless N) each time.  Contacted Dell support via online chat and after a few test they concluded that the LCD is bad. I Googled the issue and found several other reviews regarding this issue including several YouTube videos.  THANKFULLY I purchased this through Amazon.com and their customer service/returns ROCK! They are sending me another unit for exchange, and with some luck the new unit will be much better.  Fingers crossed.... I'll update this after receiving the replacement unit.  ===============================UPDATE=========================  Second unit arrived - SAME EXACT SCREEN ISSUE! Dell Technical Support warned me that they may have received a "batch" of units with bad displays - so my replacement could have the same issue. I cannot believe the lack of quality control at Dell. This was my LAST DELL purchase - EVER. Back to Amazon.com...
No good sent it back twice
The fatal flaws are right under your nose...  This computer is what it says it is and so far it does what it claims it will do HOWEVER...  1. It doesn't have a built in camera, so no skype video.  Never even thought to look.  I assumed wrongly that such things were standard these days. 2. It doesn't have any system for lighting the keyboard.  Again, most computers don't brag about it but they have some method of lighting the keyboard in the dark.  Most people will either have a social life and want skype or will be stuck home at night and want a lit keyboard.  In the event you don't need either there is one final flaw that for me tips this computer over the edge into the "fatally flawed category".  3. This mouse track-pad is truly awful.  Usually you can adjust your hands slightly and get used to it.  Maybe I'm getting old, but I simply can't.  OH - that's the final kick in the teeth with this machine.  Apparently there is no way of disabling the track-pad.  It features both the IBM-button in the middle of the key board and the track-pad and no way to disable either as far as I can tell.  In theory, if you are hacker you can rewrite some code in the bios-sphere somewhere - or if you prefer hardware you can open the machine and physically unplug it.  Probably, programmers and hackers would already know enough to avoid this machine.
Bummed  The screen freezes It over heats The battery lasts 4 hours I'm really sad about it
Very disappointed in the computer  I got the product in the mail a month ago, and from then to now it has done a terrible job. I really wanted a computer that was capable of at least a moderately fast internet speed and a good storage capacity. Sadly, I threw away the original packaging so I can not return it. Very very disappointed in this product and I do not recommend this product at all-this is probably the worst electronic I have ever owned.
get damaged
KERNAL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR  I bought an Asus UX301LA six months ago. Recently it began to blue-screen one or twice an hour with a KERNAL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR. I believe the issue is related to power distribution and similar to what's documented here:  http://technologicaltheologian.blogspot.com.ar/2012/10/zenbook-prime-and-unexpected-shutdown.html?m=1
ACER - A HORROR STORY  FALSE ADVERTISING!!!! I bought this unit based on the Acer website's technical specifications about this unit (paid $[...]). When received it, I discovered the built-in Bluetooth their website claimed it had WASN'T THERE. Even though there's a button on the keyboard to toggle it off and on and software reminders to activate it. I called Acer and they said the computer does NOT come with Bluetooth. I told them their own website said that it did. Eventually I got a letter (through the BBB) saying that they were "sorry for my inconvenience but were not responsible for the information on their website" ???!!!!???  If we can't trust Acer's own website to give us information about their own product, who can we trust? I'm still trying to return the unit. Guys, based on their reasoning, you could buy an 18' notebook, receive a 14' one and they'd just say sorry and that it's not their problem. This is not just one person at Acer who has this attitude, I went up the entire corporate ladder. At this writing the website STILL indicates Bluetooth ([...] under "Configurations: AS8920-6048'). I suggest to any potential buyers to avoid Acer and find a company that actually takes its customer responsibilities seriously.
Don't waste your money  The PC does not have enough storage for Windows to function normally.  With Windows 10, Anniversary Update, other Windows updates, and an antivirus software you will have this laptop maxed of the 29GB storage available after the 32GB is formatted for Windows use.  The laptop will no longer be able to get updates or be of use without storage space.  Also there is another BIG Windows 10 update coming out this spring.  Don't waste your money.
battery does not charge. LCCarter
Caveat emptor  Judging from the enthusiastic comments, there are certainly 2 notebook models bearing a similar name :-). I suggest reading the comments of REAL customers in Dell's own Support Forum relating to the XPS 13. Perhaps after whizzing through those 47 pages of hundreds of complaints and Dell's Support lame excuses, you'll be able to judge for yourselves... "http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3518/t/19538215?pi239031352=47#20503712". Bon apptit!
Greatest laptop with this price  I should change my review because I realize that its screen has a problem. One week after I started to use, a bubble appears at the middle of the touch screen. The screen still functions very well, but this is very annoying. I should return this and get another one or buy something else.
BUYER BEWARE! Asus does BAD BUSINESS!  NO STARS! WORST decision I ever made! Defective merchandise...never worked properly & "the process" of trying to get it replaced by Asus has become my worst consumer nightmare ever! They are doing it all WRONG & I STILL don't have the PROPER REPLACEMENT that was promised to me when I originally sent it back to them, right before Thanksgiving!
Not the newest 2014 model anymore!  This is not the newest 2014 model. The newest Acer C720 model has an Intel Core i3 processor! [..] Available for pre-order here http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KOUIZ9E/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=1KNOP0Z2MWIQJ&coliid=I2BD5H4GL717FD. I'm not related nor affiliated to that vendor. Just want to correct this.
It not working properly and has been return
Too slow for Windows 10  We  are having serious problems with this laptop. Windows 10 is a very complex operating system and it does not run quickly enough for the small computer. We are constantly stuck waiting. Any advice?
Gave up trying to make this one work.  I finally gave up on this computer and bought an HP that I love.  Dell repaired this one once under warranty and when it did the exact same thing again they were going to charge me to repair it again. The battery would not charge and gave me a message that it did not recognize the charger.  The cord from the charger did not appear to be fitting so I believe that an interior piece that you plug the charger to was broken.  I felt they should have stood behind their work but I really did not want to continue sending it back.  Also, I was never able to set up my e-mail to work properly.  I received my HP Notebook this morning and already have e-mail as well as other functions that I need.
Pleas don't weast your money on this laptops. they are no good they thay want you to pay to send it back weast of money
Terrible memory storage. The color and size were accurate though
bad , and lost your maney  it is bad laptop, the touch screen is not working, and i cantacted the gateway campany , they told me it is hardware problems ,and because i am outside USA ,we cannot fix it this problems , in summary , this last time for me take from this campany
Not what I wanted  I bought this laptop thinking I was going to get an ultrabook - a sturdy lightweight and fast laptop for my wife. It is sturdy, but is it not fast. It hardly seems faster than the 6 year old windows XP 1.6 mhz core duo laptop it was supposed to replace. I thought Windows 7 and an i5 processor was supposed to kick it up a notch. This is a decent laptop, but it is no ultrabook, and no where near as fast as my other laptop, a 6 year old macbook pro. If speed is a priority for you, you may be disappointed with this unit, and should look for one with a solid state hard drive. That is what I am going to do.
Turn back now  By far one of the worst laptops out there. It is fragile and the keys will easily fall off and the hard drive is prone to crash. Not once but twice has my hard drive crashed and caused me to lose everythig on it. After the first time i sent back to HP and after sending it back they assured me it would not happen again and it did fine for a few months but then after installing one of windows' regular updates it crashed again and wiped out my memory. Once again I have a blank computer. Thanks HP! On a side note would anyone like to buy an empty computer thats good as new?
We loved everything about it initially  I purchased this for my 10 yo daughter to do her schoolwork.  We loved everything about it initially.  One day while she was on my bed she cried out "Mom" and upon opening the chromebook, the frame detached from the screen at the hinges.  My husband said that he could snap it back together.  We had owned it less than 2 weeks with only gentle use.  I said "No Way" and put it right back in the box and returned it.  I'm not sure what to buy now as we really did like it but the screen is flexible and that puts torque on the parts so I imagine that it could break easier than others.  So now I will have to return the cover and try another.
not good
not powerful enough for some tasks - had to return  did not do what we needed.  had to return and upgrade to a surface pro 4 which works like a dream, but of course costs 4x more
After going back and forth with Dell, Apparently this lot of computers were sold by Dell to a company in Canada and the warranty expired already, even though it is brand new. I cant get Dell to register the warranty because its a Canadian product. I cant transfer ownership because Amazon doesn't list Deal Arc's address or information. Wish me luck!
Prostar is by far the worst clevo reseller. They do not honor their warranty. Extremely bad company. Stay away!!
Quick Failure of Touchscreen  Just beyond 30 days of receipt, with very light usage, the touch screen began to malfunction triggering phantom touches that sent the machine in multiple unwanted directions. While still under warranty the online vendor refused to touch it beyond 30 days. Also, this device is huge - not much smaller than 17-inch devices.
Not a Good Laptop  I got this laptop as a temporary one while I waited for my main laptop to be fixed. The plan was to then to give it as an eventual hand-me-down gift to my little brother. I couldn't give it to him though because honestly this is one of the worst laptops I've had to use. The build itself and feel of the laptop is fine, but when you turn it on, problems start.  The issue is how slow it is and its inability to "handle the weight" of Windows 8.1 apparently. There are several issues, including disappearing mice cursors from the screen, an insanely slow hard drive (which causes the computer to freeze for huge hefts of the time), and other general issues. To expound on the mice cursor issue, it's one of the most insidious of my problems. Often, the mouse will simply stop working. The mouse position is still being tracked, but clicking with it is possible. At that point you're forced to use the touch screen until you restart the computer. Changing settings on the computer, updating the drivers for the mouse, and plenty of other solutions have failed to fix my issue. The laptop in general feels slow and has issues rendering the Windows 8 Home Screen and navigating it. Attempting a search is a lost cause.  The PC is currently used for light (and I mean light) web browsing, Spotify, and Netflix. I wouldn't recommend it if you plan to do much more (trying to code on the laptop was a goal I failed to realize). I would recommend getting a different laptop if that's within budget. If not, a laptop without a touch screen at the same price likely has better specs to make your computer feel less like a brick.  I would be tempted to give it 2 stars since it's been okay for the few things I can do with it, but it dashed my expectations (which started low) by far too much.
The AMD processors are horrible. (Just stick to Intel)  If you are looking for a computer that can get work done. You are looking at the wrong computer. The AMD processors are horrible. (Just stick to Intel). The screen resolution is horrendous. The camera is not that good at all. The only good thing about the computer is the keyboard which is very comfortable. Avoid this computer if possible
Would not buy again or recommend.  Really slow. Had issues with the "free one year subscription to microsoft office" that neither the seller, HP, or microsoft could solve, and that was the whole reason I bought this as my "work travel computer". Would not buy again or recommend.
Be great if it worked  I spent $1,850 for this door stop.  Talking to outsourced repair "support" is worthless.  I get blue screens 2-3 times a day, the computer overheats when you try to do video encoding, it has no 1304 or a card slot to add a 1394.  Drivers on the HP site are flawed or just wrong. It looks good, has great specs, i7, good video, lighted keyboard - it just does not work! I purchased 4 other laptops at about the same time, Asus, Gateway, Toshiba- and they all actually work! HP seemed to just rush this one out the door and to heck with the buyer, they sold it, their bottom line benefits in the short term.  So what if they sell junk? I have a d4t and several desktops (I am a computer lan administrator, so I work with a lot of machines) which seem to work fine. Last HP I will buy. If you need a good powerful machine, look elsewhere
CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP  Yeah........CRAP.  I had to buy something small for work and what the H$LL???  This is garbage. It takes FOREVER to start up.  I am a loyal MAC fan and due to Budget cuts had to purchase this garbage.  I just need to run one program, nope.  its full of garbage apps that take forever to erase.  YEAH WINDOWS 8 is garbage also.  Who invented this?  This is the type of gift you give someone you truly hate.  Once they open it and try to turn it on, they will be like........why?  Why would you give me this expensive door stop?  I know its a net book and they suck overall, but this has taken a whole new turn.  I am pretty sure Al-Quida would have absolutely no use for this and those guys have a use for everything............EVERYTHING!!  I don't see how people gave this 5 stars?!?!  They must of never took it out of the box.  I am so angry cause I have spent like 5 hours trying to get this thing running.  This thing makes me wanna commit  hate crimes........LOTS OF THEM!!  We need to invade and totally enslave whatever country created this atrocity.  Yeah by the way I am writing this review from another computer cause this Red Netbook of Sin is still trying to reboot.  Please DONT' buy this!!!!! (unless you are gifting and totally hate the person you are gonna give it to like we discussed)
I have one of these and I enjoyed it for about the first 3 months  I have one of these and I enjoyed it for about the first 3 months, and then it just stopped turning on. Period.  Doesn't matter if  I charge it.  Doesn't matter if I don't.  It just refuses to turn on.
Not a good idea  After some research, this laptop seemed a good move. Thin, powerful, very light and not so expensive. After a week, I had to return it. The fan made enough noise for my neighbor to know I was online and I seriously underestimated the limitations of Windows 8 (yes, even in a touchscreen). Not recommended.
This tablet/laptop is horrible! I had problems from the very beginning  This tablet/laptop is horrible! I had problems from the very beginning!! Once I finally got everything installed I had problems with websites accepting my passwords! The Irulu website is horrible as well no help whatsoever!! I'm  returning this product! Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or money on this product! ASUS is so much better!!
spent 3-4 hours diagnosing the problem with Asus tech support which was horrible. Unlike Dell  Bought 2 of these notebooks with very high expectations, as I migrated away from Dell to Asus and own N550JKs and external monitors too.  I sought to use these for my investments / trading of commodities and futures -- as they have 3 ports for 3 monitors; VGA, HDMI, and THUNDERBOLT.  To my horror, the THUNDERBOLT port causes the computer to freeze which, in turn, causes repeated reboots -- and blue screening.  In short, spent 3-4 hours diagnosing the problem with Asus tech support which was horrible.  Unlike Dell, they cannot remotely connect to your notebook computer and take over.  The call quality was horrendous and they appeared to give nonsensical or mindless answers.  In sum, DO NOT buy this if you intend to use the THUNDERBOLT to connect an external monitor.  I Googled this problem -- freezing of the computer when connecting a mini-display cable for an external monitor -- and found similar occurrences with Apple in 2011.  Problem was solved only by a driver or software patch, and, given the mediocre tech support, I won't be holding my breath for that to happen anytime soon.  Both notebooks are being returned.  Though of a lower quality, and lower price, the N550JK appears to be dollar-for-dollar a generally better buy.  Asus is a budget maker of electronics, and judging by my personal experience, price = quality = disappointed.
total disaster  Display is a true disaster. color accuracy, white balance, gamma, viewing angels ... it's like getting back to 90ies :(... battery unusable in less than a year and you can't buy a replacement.. didn't expect such a crap from lenovo :(
Buyer Beware  Save yourself a big headache and don't buy this laptop or any with windows 7. That program will not update. It is no good.
Bad product, bad customer support  Would give it 0 star if I could  Bought the refurbished product online and ran into blue screens from time to time close to 3 months period.  Finally the blue-screen situation got out of hands and I had to restore the system.  Did so by following their e-manual and start with F9 / EMS.  System then throwing "error" in the screen saying no "WMI" file found.  I then had to file a complaint/report with their CSRs who were not helpful at all.  While I am struggling with the corrupt recovery file, they kept on asking  me what I did wrong to lead to the blue screen, and would not help me with the situation that now I could not reboot my laptop without a recovery disk, which Asus has eliminated to save costs. To sum up, my complaints against Asus are: 1. Product started to show signs of failure within 3 months warranty, but they refuse to repair for me as I had barely missed the warranty period when I reported the issue; 2. No recovery disk was included during the purchase; and their recovery file which is supposed to work in this case did not; 3. Customer support did not help me with the issue (as now I am stuck with a piece of junk which cannot be rebooted). 4. I asked to speak to a supervisor and got promise by the first rep that someone will call me back in one day, but that never happened. Lessons learnt, and I will tell my experience with Asus to everyone I know for the rest of my life.
Microsoft Office does not work
The touchpad is garbage. If you are considering the Y50  It's fast, however there are some issues with the 860M graphics card and compatibility with some software.  The touchpad is garbage.  If you are considering the Y50, spend the few extra bucks and get it configured with the SSD.  I wound up purchasing an SSD b/c the WD drive that comes with this model is a dog!  Besides the graphics card and the touchpad, this is a great machine.  A bit on the pricey side, but it is very fast.  I'm on the fence about recommending this machine.  I have owned other Lenovo laptops in the past.  For me, they seem to last, and are very durable.  This unit feels rugged and well built...SOLID.  The issues with the touchpad and video card however took the gratification grin right off of my face from the get go. Update 4/13/15  The video issues remain unsolved, and now I have discovered that the widi does not connect correctly.  When it does connect, it drops the resolution to 1366X768.  After connection to external display, it will only remain connected for 2 or 3 minutes.  I have tried this with 3 different external devices.  I have contacted both Lenovo and Intel.  Both companies point the finger at each other and run the customer around in circles.  Lenovo customer service is garbage.  They usually disconnect their call when they can't come up with an answer and take weeks to respond.  They expect the end user to send their machine in over seas for repairs at customer expense.  Over 100.00 to ship to asia and back.  4 to 6 week turn around time.  Another issue that I mentioned above it the touchpad.  It is flaky at best.  There are a lot of posts in forums that have the same issue I have.  The right and left click only works about 50 percent of the time.  Lenovo's response is to have the touchpad assembly replaced.  Again, user pays shipping back and forth to Asia and 4 to 6 week turn around time.  I am currently working with the seller and if necessary with Amazon for a replacement.  IF your unit is not perfect out of the box, send it back immediately.  My unit is now almost 2 months old, for a 1200.00 laptop, I really expected more.  I am very disappointed.  My old laptop was a Lenovo U430 and that machine never failed.  I wish I didn't sell it to buy this one!! 8/18/2015 Six months later, two replacement touchpads from Lenovo, and it's still not functioning correctly.  Amazon and the seller refuse to exchange the unit stating that it's all on the manufacturer.  This is a crap deal from both Amazon and the seller.  You would think that a 1500.00 laptop would be covered in some way shape or from from either Amazon, the seller or the manufacturer.  I am getting the run around from all 3 and I have a non usable hunk of junk.
Not What Was Advertised!!!!  The computer ordered was supposed to be a 2016 Dell Inspiron with Windows 10.  What was received was a seriously used Dell which used to have Windows 7 and now does not even have Windows on it all. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to look at the Windows sticker on bottom of computer to see that it is no where near a "2016 Newest Dell Inspiron computer. This feels like a serious bait and switch!!
Received product and it never worked And now I cannot return it
It worked great for about 6 months  It worked great for about 6 months, then the screen went blank. I would have had it fixed under warenty but my grand daughter trier to look in it and broke off some little pieces on the back. That canceled the warrenty.
Broke down in 4 months, Calling support and can't understand their rep in India. .bringing it to a local place that does free diagnostics then will call to tell them what's wrong.
Good Battery life but..  That's about it.. battery life is good and the design of the netbook is appealing. Other than that it's really slow, I don't know if it's just me but I can't stand waiting for 10 seconds for the browser to open up, especially when you have just turned on the computer. I don't know if all netbooks are this slow because this was my first (and probably last) one. But to be fair, I'm used to good performing desktops and laptops and do all kinds of stuff and if, at least, browsing the net was a little faster my review would have been better. But hey, if you don't mind waiting, the price is good.
WARNING - READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY APPLE  If you are purchasing an Apple computer for ease of use and a super user-friendly GUI, go ahead and push "BUY IT NOW".  But if you are migrating over to Apple to take advantage of the apparent bargains to be found in the professional software arena (Music Production, Video Production, Graphic Arts, etc.) I am issuing a warning that Apple is lying to you.  Apple has implemented an aberrant pricing policy that varies widely from the industry standard pricing policy for professional software.  Apple, in true corporate fashion, has made this change without warning or notice.  The new policy is NO PATH TO UPGRADE.  You heard me right.  If you pay professional software prices for a piece of Apple software, and two months later they release the new and improved package, you will be stuck paying full price for the upgrade.  Do you feel like you got a deal now?  You have now paid more for your software than if you had gone with the industry leading software package (PreSONUS, Adobe Premiere, CorelDraw, etc.) and next update, you will be well behind the pricing curve.  I do not have a problem with Apple software, but rather the sneaky way in which they implemented the pricing policy.  If you are buying Apple to take advantage of these apparent deals...save your money and stick with a PC.  You will pay more initially for your software, but within a year you will be saving money.
Great computet with great features  Wonderful computer, but window 8.1 is not user friendly and the battery life could be better.
Warning, major issues, and lack of customer service  I bought an Alienware M17x in November of 2011, I loaded it up with a total cost of $5750. By March I expirenced power issues. The power adapter is plugged in but the system does not recognize the adapter. This causes the CPU to throttle back and run very slow. Dell has trouble shooted the problem over the phone, sent a technician out to replaced the mother board and adapter 5 times now. The problem still exists. They refuse to refund my money or exchange the system. Customer support says it is against policy to exchange unless I have the 4 repairs done within 30 days. Them being slow to dispatch technicians prevents 30 day policy to work in my favor. I did pay for the exteneded priemer warranty, which is now apparent to me that this was also a waste of my money. Search Google "Alienware M17x power issues". You will see I am not alone is the complaint.
Don't buy unless you want your screen to not function!!  This computer's screen is not properly fitted! Will make a loud cracking noise and pull up on the base of the laptop!! Horrible quality. I would not suggest this computer to anyone.
Horrible design  I wish a zero rating was possible. I am completely dissatisfied with this purchase. I purchased this model twice in the last 1.5 years for my 18 year old daughter. She is very responsible and always takes care of her electronics. This PC has failed her twice. The hinges on the first one broke after 8 months and left her with a cracked screen which will cost upwards of $300 to replace. The hinges on the second machine broke and cracked the screen after just 5 months. I called Acer to inquire about the warranty and I was told that they only cover hardware and software, not physical damage due to a design flaw in their product. I know it's a design flaw because the hinges and casing broke in the same place on both machines. My daughter did not break the machine. I foolishly blamed my daughter for the first machine cracking, but I now know that it was not her fault. She fell in love with the laptop due to the backlit keyboard and touchscreen features, but she's had her heart broken by Acer both times. I will never purchase an Acer again. I don't need disposable laptops with poor designs. I agree that the 4 and 5 star ratings must have been paid for. We needed a laptop that will not disappoint, so I got her a Mac today.
Cheap and Runs Like It.  Cheap and that is the only real advantage.  Numerous video card faults, videos won't play, I can't even get Microsoft solitaire to play.  This is my second machine.  I sent the last one back thinking it was defective.  I had no idea that all of them were this bad.  Keep looking, this isn't what you want.
Suck it chrome book  Dont buy you cant do anything on this thing you cant even play a simple game and it glitches and lags a lot
Pissed  There were multiple scratches at the bottom of the laptop, and a dent in the top right hand corner of the laptop; both these flaw were not listed in the description. Shipping was fast but the packaging lacked foundation. Overall, the computer works well but I'm somewhat upset about the flaws that were not listed in the description.  -------------------------------------------------------------- - I am updating to say that the trackpad stopped working. Only half of the trackpad was working when I first got it and now the whole trackpad is not working. Now that I look at it, I should not have paid $550 for this laptop because it is severely flawed in various aspects. Not only that, the laptop screen has a very loose connection to the keyboard. The reason I know this is because my sister has the exact Mac and I compared. I know that it is a used computer. But, they should have been more descriptive with the item that was coming. I was not prepared for what came. I tried to get over it but it just kept getting me upset every time I looked at it. I am very upset because I am attending college soon and was hoping to be able to use this laptop my first year of college. Not anymore :(
Dead immediately upon warranty expiration  I bought this on April 2016 and today without warning it just died. It says the OS is missing and then went black. This is one month after the warranty expired. While it worked it was great. I wouldn't buy one again.
It came with a freeupgrade to Window 10 but there was no room on the hard drive to upgrade it!
HORRIBLE  Do not order this.  It sucks.  Constantly shuts down.  Worst ever. Don't waste your money
Worked fine for about a week then had to ship it back becuase it stopped working didn't realize this computer was 10+ years old the customer service was very nice and was very helpfull
Graphics and Screen Freeze problems.  I was honestly stoked for this computer.  Gaming laptop for under 1k?  I planned to use this for my day job, my home business, and get a little overwatch in on the side.  NOPE.  The first one of these I ordered developed a power supply problem within weeks and then wouldn't charge the battery at all.  Amazon was awesome and replaced it.  Now, this new one has been randomly freezing on me with no real source cause identifiable. I have run the gambit on suggested fixes and it continues to do so.  Not to mention that on both of the computers I had to disable the cool up sale GTX graphics card because it interferes with the Intel graphics card, so my gaming is lackluster at best.  Honestly, my old thinkpad did better, at least it was reliable.
Good for office work but not much else. Questionable support.  IMPORTANT PLEASE READ: As reported by The Register on August 12, 2015, Lenovo installed their Lenovo Service Engine into the computer's BIOS so it could not be removed, even with a complete wipe and reinstall of your hard drive.  This piece of software has been found to be vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack that gives administrator-level privileges.  In English, this means Lenovo sold you a computer that can be taken over by someone else.  If you own this computer or any Lenovo computer manufactured between October 2014 and April 2015, please update your firmware to remove this vulnerability.  Notebooks go here:  http://support.lenovo.com/nz/en/downloads/ds104370 Desktops go here:  https://support.lenovo.com/nz/en/downloads/ds104373  Rating changed from three stars to one star.  My original review follows:  Yuck.  Windows 8.  I'll never get used to that Metro garbage and even though this computer comes with a touch screen, why would I want to mess it up with fingerprints?  Speaking of the screen, it looks fine but it doesn't have a wide viewing angle and it reflects the light from lightbulbs and sunny windows. Even white walls reflect on to the screen.  The true boot up time is 53 seconds (38 to boot, 15 after login).  After I Win-D to get rid of the preinstalled Metro garbage, I take a look of what software came with the computer.  - Nitro Pro 8: An Adobe PDF viewer and Editor.  Free trial only so I deleted it.  Foxit Reader is better anyway, and free. - Pokki - Supposedly a program that replaces the start menu but it doesn't work on this computer (nice job Lenovo) - McAfee - Not only is this a terrible antivirus program, but it had a "critical update" that it forced me to install.  It couldn't install the update and froze the computer until I restarted.  Deleted.  Get&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bitdefender-Internet-Security-2014/dp/B00EOAS4UA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bitdefender Internet Security 2014</a>&nbsp;instead.  Not only is it top ranked in detection but it lasts for two years. - Cyberlink Power2Go 5 and PowerDVD 10 - Ancient CD and DVD reading and writing software, they're up to version 9 and 14, respectively. - Maxthon 3 - Some browser I'm unfamiliar with so I removed it and installed Firefox  Most disturbing of all was the hardware scanner that comes with the computer.  Don't get me wrong, I like the scanner because it scans each piece of hardware with short bursts of high performance requests to test the health of each component.  The problem is my computer failed the test.  When I called Lenovo at 1-877-4Lenovo and gave them my cryptic error message, they were surprisingly nonchalant of the results of their own scanner and told me to call them again when the computer breaks down.  Not too helpful when your important data is lost, right?  Let's just say I'm not keeping anything important on this computer.  Another problem I had was registering this computer with Lenovo.  For some reason, I wasn't allowed to register until I downloaded something called the "Lenovo Dependency Package".  Once that's downloaded I try to register a second time and it doesn't recognize the information I entered and it keeps asking me to register.  This is going to be fun when I need to do a warranty claim.  The keyboard works alright and it comes with a standard 10-key.  The trackpad, however is slid over to the left side of the computer.  Great if you're a lefty but a bit unwieldy for a right handed person.  You'll probably want a mouse.  The graphics is Intel so forget about gaming and the max resolution is 1366x768 @ 60HZ.  You can get away with casual titles like Bejeweled, Pogo, Angry Birds, and the like but look elsewhere if you like playing games.  The biggest issue I had while reviewing this computer is wondering trying to figure out why I would want it over a tablet.  It has a large hard drive for storage so you may find it of use if you need to carry around a large number of files.  Lenovo says it's 1TB however only 865GB is available due to the restoration software.  Other than that I don't see why you wouldn't use a tablet instead.  If you do decide to get it, it should be plenty fast for Internet browsing and general office work.  Just don't get it for gaming.  And get plan on getting rid of a lot of useless software first.  And be prepared for a lot of hassle when dealing with Lenovo's software.
Freezing problem  I had to return mine within 2 weeks after I received it due to a problem with it freezing up on me.  I called Acer customer service at least 3 times for this problem and I had to reload my computer twice and the problem kept happening.  Customer service was good, but maybe this one was just a lemon.  Overall, besides the freezing problem, I think it's a good price for what you get (if you get one that doesn't have any problems) and it's small which makes it very portable.  Returning it was very easy and Amazon customer service was very good. Thank you
I got the worst product which is defective.
Worst Mac EVER  Putting it honestly, I hate everything about this computer. I've used macs since 1988. The is the worst one ever. Speed is slow, apps (even native apple ones) constantly crash. Apple went in the wrong direction. My next computer will be a PC.
Not too great.  Bought this for my wife as a gift for school. It is purely web based, so absolutely nothing can be installed onto it. Hopefully she passes her classes without the software she needs. Also, the company it was bought from will not return it because it was "used." Would not recommend for any student.
You had ONE JOB, Chromebook.  I had high hopes for this machine. I've had HP before and normally they make good stuff. This Chromebook is garbage.  Out of the box I had trouble connecting to the internet.  It would boot up, connect, and then crash. Only way to reconnect was to shut down and reboot the machine.  This problem would happen every time though, at intervals of 5 to 20 minutes.  NO OTHER wireless device in my home (and we have about 10 of them) has this problem.  It's definitely a Chromebook issue.  Further research indicated that this is a problem common to Chromebooks...and a lot of finger-pointing as to whose fault it was.  If it can't reliably connect to the internet, why on earth would I want it?!!  It's back in the box and Mr. UPS is picking it up tomorrow.
HORRIBLE!! the description says used VERY GOOD  HORRIBLE!! the description says used VERY GOOD! in working condition upon arrival. which was NOT THE CASE!! half of the keyboard keys did not work and the mouse control was extremely laggy. very disappointed!!!
Poor Quality, No Power, Not Enough RAM...  With only 2 GB RAM this laptop is extremely slow. With all the included apps installed by ACER and the proprietary restore/recover features (translate: issues.) it is full of quirks. About all it is really good for is email, writing, and lightweight tasks. I do not recommend installing MS Office or any of the apps, they are just far too slow.  Other issues include a very cheap keyboard in that the keys wear out very quickly, in turn, making it very difficult to do much typing, which then makes it not even fit for typing papers and e-mail.  Overall I give this laptop a big fat ZERO.
Absolutely awful! Do not buy! Comes with a Gmail account logged on and you cannot factory reset total trash!
Not a happy customer  I was not happy with the feature functionality and performance. My old Dell, I use for work and my old HP performed better. I wanted to return it, however, Amazon and Eclipse Express have a 30 day return policy.
2 weeks  This worked great for exactly 2 weeks. Now it's fully charged but won't power on. Of course I bought screen protectors and a case. I'm not sure yet if I can factory restore to clear my stuff. I'm shipping it back.
This is a waste of  This computer freezes all the time. Spend the money on a new one. This is a waste of money
super slow, cannot even handle youtube and facebook at the same time. lags more than my 2006 dell. returning it!
Don't buy this product!  Not happy with this product, or with the customer service, or lack thereof on Lenovo's part.  I purchased this laptop through Costco.  I had it for less than two weeks, when out of nowhere I open the laptop to use it and I hear a loud cracking noise.  I look down to realize that the plastic along the screen as well as then hinge plastic are cracking apart.  I did a little research to find that this is a continuous product flaw for the Y50-Y70 models.  There were forums full of complaints and pictures of the exact same issues that I was having.  This laptop had not been dropped, crushed, pressed or used in any manner other than a typical laptop opening and closing.  When I called Lenovo, they determined, over the phone, that my damage was NOT covered by the warranty, but they would be happy to fix it for 300 dollars.  This mad ZERO sense to me.  The told me the other option would be to return it to Costco and see if they would refund it.  Which they did.  Thank God.  I talked to the rep with Lenovo for 45 minutes before I gave up and wiped the hard drive and returned it to Costco for a computer with similar specs, a cheaper price tag, and I can only assume what will be better customer service than this joke of a company.
Came broken brand new.  Backlit keyboard is broken. Had to return.
Spend the money on a different laptop.  This laptop should not be bought. I am currently typing from one at an angle on this chair, because i have to prop the screen up. Do you know why?  Its because the hinges broke by themselves. Also, the glass and screen part of the screen separated from the back metal part of it, and i have to constantly press them both together. To open up my laptop, i have to hold the screen together near the hinges, then lift the whole thing up, while keeping the keyboard pressed against my body so that it doesnt move. This happened 1 year after i got it, randomly too. ive had to have it for another year after that, and am about to get a new computer. One more thing, anytime i put the computer to sleep and wake it back up, it won't connect to the internet until i put it to sleep and wake it up again. Do not get this laptop, the only thing i like about it is the fact that it boots up from being off very quickly, and its not usually slow. but thats it. I am not gonna get another HP laptop for a while, if ever.
Touchpad buttons stopped working!  I got the computer & thought it was working well, with the only caveat being the touchpad was REALLY sensitive.  It would move around when I was typing & randomly select links or jump to other open windows.  I also use an external wireless mouse because the touchpad controls became annoying.  I went to the touchpad controls & adjusted it to the lowest sensitivity & turned off drag lock.  It helped a little.  I also noticed that tapping the touchpad to click wasn't very responsive.  I was using the touchpad & no external mouse yesterday & then the buttons (right & left) stopped working.  I could still move the pointer around the screen, but could not click on anything.  I reconnected my wireless mouse via USB & for some reason, the wireless mouse's drivers needed to be reinstalled. Once the wireless mouse was reinstalled, I then had problems using that one.  I could move that pointer around, but it would also not click on anything.  I rebooted the computer.  I then had a problem with the keyboard.  The wireless mouse worked, but when I tried to type my password to unlock my computer & the keyboard was unresponsive.  The touchpad buttons still didn't work.  I rebooted again & had the same problem.  I then went to the onscreen keyboard drop down menu & reselected US (international).  The keyboard started working again, so I relogged into the computer & went back to the touchpad controls to switch right/left button functionality (buttons still didn't work after that) & switched them back (still didn't work), turned off/on the touchpad (didn't resolve problem), went to tapping to check the setting-both tapping & drag lock were checked (not sure why drag lock was re-enabled)-turned drag lock off again & tested tapping, which still didn't work.  I turned the touchpad off/on with the fn f3 keys & that still didn't work.  I also noticed the wireless mouse worked on most of the screen, but for some reason wouldn't work on a few spots (clicking or dragging) on the right side of the screen. I rebooted again & the keyboard & wireless mouse appeared to be working fine.  I then went online & looked up help & saw a TON of people with Dell's have touchpad issues.  I checked for updates for it's drivers & it said they were up-to-date & the windows diagnostic said the device was working properly (which it is not).  The only thing I changed on the computer that day was to turn the hot key in the upper right hand corner to be "turn off display".  This morning I see that Amazon isn't even selling this model anymore & the product is under review because customers have said something is wrong with it.  Very disappointed because I've owned many Dells that I've had for each for years.
Starting to get disappointed  This laptop is really good. Like totally great. The screen is alittle smaller than normal 15.6 inch laptop. It does not overheat unless you do super hardcore gaming. I gamed a few decent graphic game the first time and it heated up near where your palms are leaning on, but after 4-9 games it stop getting warm. My laptop froze about 3 times and im still trying to figure out the cause of it. The only thing I can think of is that it is chrome. Freezing happened to my last laptop when I had chrome. It loads up in 3-4 sec, then log in. after logging in, loads up another 3 sec. In reality of it, you only have 22 gb free of solid state drive. and the other is like 800 gb. I don't know where the rest of the gb went. I don't mind I guess. I use an external hard drive. This is my first time using windows 8 and its different but im getting use to it.   Honestly in my opinion, technology is changing so mind as well catch up with it. no need to stay with the window 7 . I always keep my laptop plugged in and not use the battery so i couldn't tell you how long it last. Info: if you are playing at home or using at home. plug the laptop in without the battery in the laptop, that way you aren't overcharging your battery. I also use an external fan pad under the laptop and it stays nice and cool.  The laptop also comes with a program that has an auto control for your fan so you can dust out the interior of your laptop. I thought it was pretty cool. It's under the energy management program.  Shipping? I was irritated when my laptop came to my house. It was shipped how you buy a laptop at bestbuy or fries and it comes in a laptop box. Well,,, my laptop came to my house in a LAPTOP BOX, and by UPS. So you know, if I wasn't at home, someone knows that oh hey, you got a laptop in front of your house and no one is home. I can steal it. get it? So if you're expecting this laptop, I suggest you stay home the day you get it, or you gonna get jacked.  Pros: fast, screen quality is clear, font size is small. Cons: Freezes at times.  Update: Apparently Lenovo warranty does not cover software issues. Lenovo warranty only covers hardware issues. and one day fix for SOFTWARE is 89.00. yes, thats right, 89 dollars for one day fix and it covers you for your laptop not breaking down for only 3 days. yup, 3 days only. My laptop freezes and starting to have a black flickering screen and turned black. I don't know but I hear some models have this issue about leaving it on for awhile then when u do something, the screen turns black and flickers when u move the mouse.
Well the mother board went out days after the short warranty and they would not do anything. I used it very little, 20 hours at the most & only played spider solitaire and looked at a few things online. I only used it while my daughter was receiving her Chemotherapy treatment every few weeks.  We don't have a money tree and live on one income since my daughter became sick. I was so happy to get this and it did work nice for the few times I used it..  when the problem started contacted them about the problem but the warranty was up,so I took it to a friend that works on computers and he well the mother board is out and what it would cost to get repaired was a lot more than what I had paid for it. He also said the company had to know it was about to go out when they sold it to me. It was refurbished when I purchased it. So I have to say, it was a waste of my money and I'm not going to recommend this company for anyone looking at buying a used computer.  I don't like saying bad things about anyone and don't like giving bad reviews. It's taken me 2 years to leave my review because I hate being nasty BUT I HAVE TO SAY--BUY FROM SOMEONE ELSE that is honest or has a service person that knows how to fix things right .
Not for College Use, only best for mobile usage.  Coming from a person who owns a laptop, the chromebook is very basic and you will get frustrated with the operating system quickly when you realized that there are a bunch of things you cannot do.  For a very light user, this computer will do the trick of going online and that's about it. For webcam usage, you will have to rely on google hangouts but keep in mind that google hangouts is banned in China if you're trying to connect with people over there.  For someone needing to use a computer everyday or so, I suggest buying a real laptop. You can get a decent one for around $700 or a low-end one for around $400. If you're buying this for college, DON'T. I suggest getting a real laptop as a chromebook is really restrictive and when you're in college, you're going to need every opportunity your computer can provide to exceed and there are many programs that you need to install.
Broken Keyboard  I received my laptop and I was super excited...only to find out that the touch screen keyboard DOES NOT WORK. Whenever I press the "e" key, a whole bunch of smiley faces show up instead. I would not recommend this laptop to anyone unless they want to waste money. I want to return it, and am in the process of figuring out how to. I had this laptop for less than a week.
2-3 minutes to do simple things like open the control panel  Purchased 3 of these and within 2 weeks, 2 of them had the functionality of a door stop.  1 would turn off 4 seconds after you pressed the power button, even while being plugged in to an outlet.  The other, from the time I took it out of the box, took literally 7-8 minutes to boot up and display the desktop and taskbar, 2-3 minutes to do simple things like open the control panel, create a folder or even bring up a menu when you right click.  I even went in to the settings and attempted to disable the programs that begin on startup to try to speed things up and it didn't matter.  Seemed to be a processor issue.  To be fair, I didn't have any problems with the 3rd laptop of the bunch, but didn't want to take any chances and have it stop working after the 30 day return policy so I shipped it back.  Not a good product at all.
This came with a bad hard drive right out of the box. Has to be returned.
Quite possibly one of the worst laptops I've ever owned  Back in 2009 I purchased HP's so-called powerful high-performance HDX-16 Laptop.  I purchased one of the higher end ones.  Upgraded Specs were:  - 2.53Ghz Core 2 Duo - 320GB HDD (after first year I upgraded this to a 500GB Seagate Hybrid SSD/ - 6GB RAM - 1GB Nvidia GeForce GT 130M  Went to the HP website and purchased this computer because it was supposed to be one of the best the company offered at that time.  Total cost after taxes came out to nearly $1,500.00.  I purchased it with the intention of it giving me good reliable performance for at least 4-5 years at a minimum.  When spending this kind of money on a computer, it's what a consumer would expect.  INITIAL IMPRESSIONS First couple of months of owning the computer, it was wonderful.  Fast and reliable.  Large and beautiful 16" screen.  It was very quiet and never even got very hot unless I played a highly demanding game on it.  It was very fast when it came to multitasking, video editing, and playing high intensity video games.  Initially I was extremely satisfied with the computer.  AFTER FIRST YEAR Around month 12-14 of owning this computer is when the problems started.  The multimedia bar at the top of the keyboard started malfunctioning.  Wi-Fi would constantly turn on and off on its own randomly while I'm using the net.  The volume controls would also turn themselves up and down randomly.  The battery failed around month 14 and already needed to be replaced.  The laptop fan began running extremely loud just from regular web-surfing.  It even started to run hot without even doing any demanding tasks.  Since it was past the magical one-year mark, HP did little to help and wouldn't even acknowledge most of these issues.  I cleared the laptop of all dust and bought a new battery in hopes of it helping the system.  It didn't change the heat nor the loud noise from the fans attempting to cool the system.  After researching online about this laptop, I discovered that other users had been having some of these same problems with this model laptop.  It came from the extremely cheap and low-quality parts HP used to make this machine.  At this point I felt it was best to just keep using this laptop despite it's problems since I paid so much money for it.  YEARS 2-3 AND LAST DAYS A little after the full second year of having this computer, the replacement battery that I bought was pretty much dead again.  The laptop had began running louder and hotter than ever.  The media smart controls at the top of the keyboard were still running wild.  There periods of 30 straight minutes where the Wi-Fi would turn itself on and off over and over.  Making internet unusable for significant amounts of time.  The fingerprint reader still worked but there were times where it wouldn't respond and it was quicker to just type in your password manually.  Just as in the first year, HP would not acknowledge these problems.  Eventually I just became fed up with this computer.  A $1500 machine that only performed well for about 11 months is unacceptable.  This 3 year experience left me completely disappointed and angry with HP.  I will never again buy one of their products and cannot recommend them for anyone else who plans on using their machine for over a year.  I had decided to get an Apple Macbook Pro (2011) and to sell the HP HDX for whatever value it still had.  As if the disappointment from the machine itself wasn't enough, I had discovered that my grand $1500 machine deteriorated to barely being worth around $250 after only 3 years.  Most computer places didn't want to buy the machine at all.  Right now I couldn't be happier with my MacBook and a company who actually cares about their consumers concerns.  FINAL THOUGHTS If you're in the market for a new laptop, I have to strongly recommend you stay away from HP.  At least stay away from their so called "high-end" machines.  I honestly would not spend more than $300 on one of their machines.  I've had underwhelming laptops before but to spend $1500 on one that performs well for barely a year is pathetic and a disgrace.  If you're only a casual user looking to surf and use Facebook, then their low end machines might be ok.  Otherwise go with someone else.
This Ones Is Okay For Now  Right now, it's great, but if it breaks down like my other 2 DELL's in the past, I will not purchase another DELL, ever again.  Even though I have been a preferred customer through my work since 2009, I get very little satisfaction from customer service.  Their service is doled out to people who can't speak English very well, and I can't tell you how many times they have hung up on me when I tell them what my issues are.  They need driver disks to repair my machine?  What if I can't find them? The warranty cuts out just in the nick of time for DELL. Late January: Here's the latest:  No one had dropped it, nor harmed this computer in any way.  It has started to flicker.  All sorts of different windows are popping up all over the screen.  As far as I know, what I purchased in regard to repair is only for if it has been harmed by negligence in any way, so getting it repaired will come out of my pocket.  What a waste.  DELL is off my list for purchases forever, now, for sure.
0 for 2 - done with this model  Was excited to get a Predator with the 1070 card.  Very heavy but nice laptop.  Would not charge or run off battery.  Sent back to Amazon for replacement.  Acer wanted me to pay shipping for the repair.  Not for this beast I'm not.  I will update once the replacement gets here.  **Update: 11/3/16  Replacement came in and runs great.  I am pretty happy with this laptop.  The only exception is that the 256GB SSD are two crappy 128GB Lite ON SATAs in RAID 0.  Some review websites had NVME Toshiba drives in the first slot and the second slot open.  I was looking forward to being able to add a second M.2 SSD for extra capacity.  Pretty much a bait and switch from ACER.  I understand that this is pretty common for review models vs what actually is sold.  I am leaving at 3 stars for that reason alone.  Everything else is good.  Battery life is decent even for a gsync panel.  About 4-5 hrs for general use.  Haven't tried gaming, but expecting 1-2 hrs max.  Screen is nice.  1080p nice and bright with no bleeding.  While it is G-SYNC, it is only 60Hz and I was only able to overclock the panel to 65Hz before running into issues.  One nice feature is that even though the CPU is not over-clockable (by a novice at least), the GPU can be overclocked with built in ACER software.  No benchmarks worth sharing yet (because I planned on putting all my games on the second M.2 ssd that I now realize I have no room for.  Mixed bag of emotions right now.  I do like that laptop, but feel duped into thinking I was getting an NVME Toshiba 256GB drive and an open slot when I got two crappy 128GB Lite On drives with no expansion room.  *** Final update  Well left button in the trackpad lost spring and started sticking an hour in.  I wanted to like this computer, but QC is an obvious issue with this batch.  Sending back for refund. Maybe I will try Alienware.
Bad Device  Today I learned the reality that Google Chromebooks completely run like crap. Trying to type on poop would be better. They are not a computer that happens to run Google well, they will not run any program not sold by Google. No Microsoft Word, only Google Docs, and no apps not made by Google like the Fitbit walking device and the software that runs it. Plus it was broken when it got to my house, with a cracked screen. Wow, total crap.
Keep in mind that you'll be buying a battery in a year as well  After exactly a year and 30 days later, the battery failed to work... and now I am back online purchasing a battery... don't buy a compaq...
Do not buy!!! I'm going through my second hard drive now. At least the first one was honored by the dell warranty.  I only use it for work documents and its still crashing. I find myself using my 6 year old computer instead because it won't connect to the Internet unless you are sitting next to the router.  Overall, a terrible buy. Don't buy it even though the specks look appealing. You might as well get a 10 year old laptop if you're looking for comparable performance.
YUK  Lightweight, but...  I hate Windows 8.1 and the cursor jumps around with no touch at all.  Will not buy it again.
F***K THIS THING  SO BAD NOT WORTH IT CAN NOT DOWNLOAD ANYTHING AND THE CHROME BROWSER RESTRICTS YOU SO MUCH YOU CAN BUY A BETTER COMPUTER FOR THE SAME PRICE
Glitchy, terrible customer support, buy something else  This is my first, and it's bad. My machine has been shutting down after a warm boot since I bought it. I tired all of the fixes on the Acer website, including ordering a special set of Torx screwdrivers. Nothing worked including resetting my machine (losing everything) at the advice of customer support. I had to send it off for repair (buying a box and paying for shipping myself). When I got it back, all they had done was reinstall Windows.  The problem returned just after I had taken the time to reinstall everything on my machine. Acer had me reset my machine again, again losing everything. Didn't work, repair trip #2. This time they replaced the SSD. Problem again returned right after I had reinstalled everything, again Acer told me to reset my machine (Acer tech actually asked me if I had any important files on my computer...), and it again didn't work, so repair trip #3.
WHY IS AMAZON TOUTING THIS COMPUTER?  IF Amazon knows the problems with Acer and this model in particular, then why oh why is it being promoted on my kindle's first page?
I hate HP and this computer  I like the back light on the computer.  And I like the weight of it.  But the keyboard response is lousy and doesn't respond easily.  It also enlarges frequently.  I am always having to reset it.  The screen blacks out and I can't get it to turn on again until I shut down the computer.  I have only had this computer since August and I would love to return it!  Don't buy this one.
Suddenly gave up on me. Is inoperable now.  1 year and 13 day since I bought this, worked at acceptable rate till now but  stared making strange notices followed by extreme lag and screen freezes in recent weeks. Tried everything and now my student budget will take a massive hit.
Bad computer overall, lots of hardware problems
The price is cheep for a reason unfortunately, bad performance and very high temps  Well I got it and I was supper excited to get it out and start playing games on it.  First I updated windows and all the drivers and the fan kept coming on and it was getting hot so I opened up the utility that was on the laptop and saw that the processor was at 75C which is pretty hot for not doing anything. But I didn't worry about it so the next day I was playing some star craft and it was getting crazy hot like I almost couldn't touch the laptop hot.  I'm use to gaming laptops I have an Asus g74 my wife has a g75 and my dad has a custom gaming laptop so I know how they run and should be but this thing was ridiculous.  My game started to lag bad (7fps) so I excited out and checked the temps and the processor was up to 98C around 200F it shouldn't be getting that hot and it should be able to out perform my 4 year old Asus neither which it could do.  So I'm sending it back and probably just going to save up and get another Asus ROG.  They cost a lot but they perform well and last a long time.  And all in all the return process has been a nightmare...
did not even last a year and the batter completely shot.. JUNK..
broken in the mail  It got broken in the mail and didn't work, so I returned it.
Promised assistance from dell never happened  Dvd player never worked!!!
Nice computer - no customer support from Acer  I have no real problems with the design and performance of this laptop, except for the trivial problem that it attracts fingerprints like mad. I do have a huge problem with Acer, which provides NO support for the OEM version of Windows 7, even under the warranty period.  Before buying, please be clear on what the warranty covers: It covers 1 year of hardware support only. The only other support is that for 3 months, Acer will reinstall the software, but not provide any other form of support.  I'm having a problem now where after two days the laptop stopped seeing the Windows XP computers on my network. As a result I have no practical way of transferring files.  In summary: If you have any Windows problems, you have to rely on community support or fee-for-service support from Microsoft or Acer's own version of paid support. I'm not sure what service other manufacturers provide these days when it comes to the OEM Windows version, but if there are better options, I would strongly consider this before making a decision to purchase this computer.
laptop  I received it but the fan is too loud to study with. I really wish i knew that before buying it. Cant even go with it to class. Waste of money.
CRACKED screen panel  We purchased 2 of these laptops, one for myself and one for my husband. Now, less than a year later they both have huge cracks in the panel surrounding the screen. Mine has one crack and my husband's laptop has two cracks. We aren't particularly rough with them and we didn't drop them... They're just built really poorly. As far as I can tell, with Amazon's warranty we're just out of luck. I completely regret this purchase and if I could give it no stars I would!
It seems like Apple has some QA issues  I have just returned the second MBP for defects. First one had couple of keys on keyboard with some scratches and super drive was some what loud. the  second one had some issue with mouse cursor freezing up. especially when I'm using photoshop to zoom in and out (or other quick key function), it would freeze and lose control over what I wanted to do. I should have kept the first one if I had know that second one would have more serious issue. anyways, what I have learned is that Apple do not have the best QA and bit disappointed. I'm now without a laptop until Amazon send me a replacement. Hopefully next one will be a decent one.
Awesome laptop, except the processor they put in it is a lie.  Everything looked awesome, until I ran an index on the specs of the laptop, and found out mine has a 2.4 GHZ processor instead of a 3.4 GHZ processor.
If you want to run 8g ram or more, don't buy this one.
So...slow....  Very very slow. Even when connected to my own personal wifi
Broken within 10 month  I had a Toshiba laptop abut 15 years ago and that one lasted forever. Bought this through Amazon last summer and the hard drive malfunctioned in less than 10 month.  I will NOT recommend Toshiba any more.
You get what you pay for...  This machine is very slow.  I bought it to replace my wife's aging Asus EEE Netbook, which is starting to break down after being used every day for 4-5 years.  I love Asus in general, I just went too cheap on this model.  Unfortunately, the specs on the machine barely handle Windows 8.  It crawls.  Do yourself a favor and pay a little more to get a better model.  I'm returning this one and doing the same.  As a bonus, the battery in the laptop I received was DOA, wouldn't charge at all.
Don't waste your money  I've had this laptop for about 4 years now and it's slow... REALLY slow. Don't waste your money, buy another laptop
Gone in the first month, you get what you pay, never again!
I got completely screwed. This is my third Dell laptop. The first two were OK and I had few problems with their functionality. This one is a different story. Four months after I bought this machine, I opened the screen one morning to find a crack in the display. There had been nothing to cause this, it just appeared. A couple of days later another crack appeared. And now there are several. All the while this computer has been sitting on my desk. I contacted Dell and told them this story. They said the only way this could happen was if damage was inflicted on it. And that my warranty would not cover this due to the abuse. I did a little looking and ended up at the Dell customer forum. There I found several people that had the same thing happen to them. The Dell reps are completely oblivious, they are continuing to say there was abuse. This amounts to calling me dishonest. So I went online to see about getting this fixed any way possible. I found a replacement screen for $105 with an instruction video tools and full support. Dell had quoted me $319 just for the screen. And of course since it was not under warranty, I would have to pay for labor and shipping as well. As you can see, this is a horror story. I could go on about the complete lack of support and how it now constantly hangs up requiring rebooting. But this is enough.
functional, but very poor keyboard, faulty SSD  Pros: fast, quick start, good display, light Cons: absolutely awful keyboard, no USB port on right side, poor touchpad, hard to right-cick Cons: SSD failed in about 14 months from the date of purchase. Common problem for Sony Vaio according to message boards. Company refuses to recognize the problem and issue a recall. Surprisingly poor service from well recognized brand name. Will stay away from Sony in the future.
arrived today and the matte screen is horrible. the font and screen is so washed out that it's barely visible especially when trying to view video of any type. unable to find any brightness control and have spent a couple hours looking to improve the display without success! bad choice.
This keeps getting worse and worse
Piece of Junk! Don not buy!  I had this for a little over one year. The USB ports died! And the crazy thing is that the troubleshooter claims the USB ports and drives are working properly! I took it to a computer tech guy where I bought it and he said that he could not fix it. He told me it was not worth fixing, it is a piece of junk! It would cost more than the computer is worth to buy new USB ports and replace them yourself. I am very angry and disappointed. I hoped this computer would last longer.
One can get better Price and Performance in today's market  Ordered 8 of this computer for company.  Two were defected with one which I had to return as I could not power it back up after turning off.  Fragile casing which could break anytime.
P.o s  No waste of money and it broke all they would do is fix not even replace it and now stuck without a computer
Junk  Even for the low priDce, this is a waste of money.  It freezes and is very slow.  I am going to return it and get a Dell or Asus.  The placement of the shift key makes it impractical and virtually unusable for anyone who types
Not impressed.  I purchased this laptop roughly 9 months ago.  I was fairly impressed at this computer in the first two weeks.  Until the ssd malfunctioned (due to incorrect installation) and I had to have it replaced.  After this point it performed OK.  I use it for a little bit of everything, from gaming to browsing to photo editing.  It did fine at photo editing and browsing but be informed... If you plan to play games do NOT get this laptop.  It has trouble running minecraft.  (very low framerate and lag)  However I was able to live with how it performed I have just about had it with this laptop as about 2 days the mouse pad has started glitching out.  It won't recognize my finger all the time.  I will have to drag my finger multiple times before it recognizes it.  On top of this, if you are typing documents with the mouse pad on, it will randomly sense your hand and bump your cursor to another point in the paragraph.  Overall, I would say stay away from Dell products.  They have poor build quality and design.  I am switching to Apple as I have never had significant problems with their products.
Ok laptop  For the power and ram of this laptop, it's slower than molasses. Keyboard isn't backlit. Battery doesn't last as long as it should. At default settings with no added software, the battery software said I had thirty mins of charge left. Browsing the internet, it died 5 mins later. Sent it back and got a refund. I think one of the cpu's wasn't working.
Bad Investment  This is the worst investment we have ever made. It locked up after 3 uses and even though we purchased extra protection no one would help us or make this right. Wanted to give it 0 stars but couldn't.
NOT HAPPY AT ALL  It never worked right from the begining!! The space bar stuck always, and the monitor would flicker,  I called dell and shipped it in for service,  they came back and said $280 to fix, liquid was poured in it.  This is how I got it,  I never poured anything in it,  NOT HAPPY AT ALL!!
SD card reader UNRELIABLE!!!  I can only give this laptop a 1 star rating as the sd card reader is very unreliable as the 64GB Sandisk Ultra only works 20% of the time. It is not the SD card as I tried several others I have and the problem persists. This is a real problem especially as this notebook only has 64GB eMMc storage I was really relying on the SD card to bolster storage. Lenovo fix this urgently.
I do not recomend this store, keep climbing had stole me with this laptop, i just use for 6 month and then got break (the motherboard couldn't work anymore)
Major Ripoff Dud - Asus K55N - DS81  I would rate this "negative stars" if I could. Never again will I buy a " new" laptop computer through Amazon.  It worked fine for 2 days then the hard drive quit. $300 later I had a new hard drive in this piece of junk.  Almost doubled the original price. The tech who fixed it had to get new drivers from Brazil as he said the old ones were not installed for use in the US.  He said Asus produces hard drives which fail 1 in 5 times due to poor quality control.  Wow, guess  I got the one - and no warranty.  Last time I'll buy an Asus and last time I will EVER buy from an individual off the internet.
Horrible choice. Please do not buy this product.  Horrible. Wouldn't refer anyone to buy refurbished products that aren't from apple itself. This laptop was gutted and didn't have apple original hardware. Didnt work well either. Please do not buy from this seller.
Crashed a month into having it even though I purchased the recommended protection. Microsoft help line said that they had never seen a computer with so many problems
Defective  The laptop worked for a couple of hours then shut down and would not restart. Took it to an expert and was told that I new motherboard. Which basically  means a new laptop
Broken motherboard  I received this laptop very quickly, shipping is top notch. However, the laptop wouldn't turn on because the motherboard was not functional. The laptop is currently still with Acer customer care, fixing the problem... after I paid an additional $40 to ship it back to them.
Very slow!  This is not a good laptop! It is very slow. It seems that something wrong with it because it shouldn't be so slow.  Also the screen is bad- eyes are tired after short time looking at it. It is also very heavy.
sent back
I just recieved this today..and after 20 minutes of use the battery went dead and the charger won't charge the unit. im suspecting a big time rip off. Havent heard back from the vendor.
Unreasonably slow  The keypad is either unresponsive or it responds to unintentional wrist/thumb strokes. The whole thing is slow in everything you try to do (open new windows/tabs, downloading, opening folders, etc.), even playing solitaire. Would not buy again.
Defective  The laptop design is flawed. The external power port is connected to the motherboard which is easily broken. This will cause the whole laptop to break and will cost $500 to fix. Do not buy this laptop and if you do get a good warranty.
Lenovo laptop  Had to return it. Took up to 90 minutes for start-up screen to show. Called Lenovo but they could not help me. So I returned it
The charger cannot work any more only bought the Chromebook 2 months.
I strongly don't recommend this  battery doesn't work, the same problem had friend of mine from same seller, I strongly don't recommend this seller
This is the worst computer I have ever owned (and I am a mac person, so its not about that). This laptop crashes multiple times a day. Want to stream something? hope you enjoy lag. Want to stream something and work on something on text edit? not going to happen. What to open a large website? better do it on your phone  This computer is infuriating. I cannot wait to replace it.
Do not buy  Very cheap case...made in China. Basically is tablet technology stuck in case. TOS even refers to it as a phone. Has difficulty connecting to internet. Bought for kids to do school work.
It's really bad product. Just one year after buying  It's really bad product. Just one year after buying, it was broken. Monitor was gone! I heard Dell products have poor quality continuously. But It's real. Please consider whenever you think about buying Dell products!
Button stick. Kicks you out of apps unexpectedl . Very slow . Can't view/open downloads. Returning item.
Get what you pay for  I find this to be a fairly useless product. Freezes constantly. Can't seem to keep up with itself. Up and down keys are frequently locked or frozen so have to restart. Keyboard jumps while tying. Should have sent back
Broke in less than 5 months!  Bought this laptop late September and it completely stopped working by early February. The screen went black and the laptop will not take any charger. This is my first time buying an apple product on Amazon. I'm very disappointed in the quality of product here. I went with Amazon over Best Buy (even though Best Buy had a cheaper price on this exact laptop) because my college laptop broke and I needed it ASAP for homework. I recommend not to buy this product, at least not on Amazon....  Pros: was light, perfect for walking around campus Cons: BROKE in 5 months
Was good, losing faith  If you can get past the price this is the best PC laptop out there. First and foremost this machine is for work. Its the thinnest quad core with dedicated graphics, with a premium build, and a decent battery. I work in a field ruled by Macs and I commute and travel a fair bit and I can't be lugging around a 7lb piece of cheap glued plastic with a 36 minute battery life. It ticks all of the boxes for me and ultimately I feel I got what I paid for. If it holds up I'll surely be back for another.  Pros: Runs latest Ubuntu fairly well (only bug is you need to click "Sleep" before closing lid...) Fully maxed out, it gives many desktops a run for their money. Never slows down, never hiccups. Battery is decent once tweaked. Looks good besides the Razer logo on the back - if your over 30 you'll want to cover it up :P Screen is the best I've had on a PC. Silent when running Ubuntu unless I'm compiling something for more than a few minutes straight.  Cons: Loud under medium load and any time I run Windows 8. You NEED headphones while gaming. A lot of bezel around screen. Its more than I expected, but not a deal breaker. Speakers are so so. Only has HDMI 1.4a with no other display connectors. Minimal look is huge plus, but I could go for mini display port and maybe an sd card slot.  UPDATE:  Still running strong. Recently got a 4k monitor and found my first real complaint - it only has HDMI 1.4a which means 4k is stuck at a choppy 30Hz. Even dragging the mouse across the screen looks ridiculous let alone anything else with movement. I'll keep poking at it to see what if it can be remedied.  UPDATE 2:  After ~6 months the delete key and right arrow keys started to go. They'd repeat several times from a single press, and now finally died entirely. Working with Razer to resolve. Stuff like this shouldn't happen on a nearly $3,000 laptop.
Worked for less than a year and died. Still has power but no screen.
Color not as shown  Just recieved yesterday. Very disappointed in the fact that the computer is two tone pink. Now having to find something to conver up the terrible barbie car pink that is on the mouse wrist area. It is not all the beautiful orchid magenta as shown and described.
DO NOT BUY THIS - OR ANY - ACER PRODUCT  This is the worst computer I have ever used. I would give it zero stars if that were an option. I purchased the laptop at Frys, the Internet Explorer and WiFi didn't work so I returned it within one week. The techs there were not able to fix it and gave me a new one. The new one is also not working properly. The Internet Explorer and wifi also do not work. I contacted Frys who refused to replace it and told me to contact Acer directly. I contacted Acer requesting a refund. They refused to do so. I was on the phone for 1 hour with them, got terrible customer service and no resolution. They told me to mail in my laptop at my own expense. I am an independent contractor and need my laptop to work. I told the customer service rep this and she told me to borrow a family member's computer. This is not a solution. The end result: I have to mail in the laptop, wait for them to look at it and try to repair it. Since Frys was unable to fix the first lemon, I doubt they will be able to fix this one. I wasted $1400, not including the software I purchased for the laptop.
Not worth the money  Yes, it was cheap but I expected it to last longer than 9 months!
This is so slow. It takes forever to go from page to page. Hard to watch Netflix because it's so slow. Wish I had bought something else!
before a year the laptop went down the motherboard went bad. had to spend more money for a new one, but not this brand, heats up too much on your lap.
A bad purchase!  Can 't keep it connected for any length of time......not a happy camper!
Not actually 13.3 inches diagonally. Measured to be 12.5. Has a multitude of hardware issues. Dell technical support is absolutely horrible, no one is of help and will waste your time by constantly transferring your call between departments with the explanation of "we don't handle that here". I hate to say it, but Dell has made me consider converting to Macbook.
This model not so good explorer is agonizingly slow loading  Had a lenovo s10 forever switched browser to chrome no problem. This model not so good explorer is agonizingly slow loading. Then tried to download chome it just went nuts.
sending back to ASUS for a THIRD time now for repair in a year in a half. Worst laptop I've ever purchased.  The yellows are awful, I'd say it's a deal breaker. It's definately a noticeable issue I can't believe more people haven't posted about it and I'd advise others to steer clear of the laptop until this is resolved. The high resolution screen is both good and bad. Good because even though the yellows are awful the screen is ultra sharp and works well in most situations. The bad of the ultra high resolution is that a lot of apps seem to have scaling issues and I the text is tiny and impossible to read. Overall I would not recommend purchasing until the yellows are fixed, hopefully a firmware update will fix the issue soon.....if not, fingers crossed asus comes out with a 1080p version that fixes the yellows and avoids the scaling issues.  Update after a year and a half with the laptop... 1/16 If I could rate lower than one star I would. Thus far the laptop has been sent back for repairs for the following reasons.  1. Battery power got low and the battery died. It never turned on again. I had to SEND IT BACK TO ASUS. They said a component broke near the power button. Because the product was sealed I was not able to unseat and reseat the battery. I cannot express how insane that is that letting the battery get low causes it do die until sent back to the manufacturer for repair.  2. The infamous hinge. The hinge on the right side broke and they had me return it back to ASUS in order to repair. This is a very common and known issue with this laptop. Lots of people have it and its still not something that seems to get fixed.  3. Battery was low, now it doesnt power on. AGAIN. This will be my third time sending back to ASUS.
A malfunction in the card screen does not work correctly
Poor durability, poor customer service  Had this for about four months and have not used it heavily. Now we are experiencing power/boot problems and Acer wants me to ship it to them at my own expense. Poor durability, poor customer service.
Don't wait to see if it works you only have 30 days.  Out of the box the cursor jumped, I thought maybe it was just working out the kinks or I had to adjust sensitivity settings, but it has now got to the point that I can no longer type a sentence without hitting escape twice which being a full time student is not acceptable. This computer also seems slow for only having put Norton, and Microsoft Office on it after opening, my mother in laws very basic Toshiba I was using prior to purchasing this one now makes it look even worse sitting on my shelf.  Pay attention to the 30 day warranty as I was unable to do anything by the time I opened my laptop at Christmas 3 months later, being a gift from my husband. Would of been happy to exchange it as this is common among electronics, according to my Google searches for help, but cannot locate seller information to do so, so this is why the score was so low, pretty disappointed my first Dell was a hunk of junk for over $600. Would love to hear back from the seller if they see this, please contact me.
I got it twice, and was twice disappointed.  Maybe I'm just the hard-luck kid, but I thought I should share my experiences with this machine.  This seemed like a really good computer at a decent price.  When it came, it was a little big for my taste, but that's just personal preference.  The REAL problems began as soon as I started it up.  No sound came from the speakers.  I returned it and had a replacement in a day or two.  The trouble with the second one was that it would randomly go into a coma.  If left alone, the screen turned black, and pressing the power button did nothing but turn it to a lighter shade of black.  The problem soon worsened; every time I plugged in my USB mouse, the laptop...well, "died" really is the best word.  Complete and sudden shutdown, as responsive as a brick until I took out the battery, shook it around, and put it back in.  I had to do this every time.  I gave up and got an Acer Ultrabook Silver.  It's smaller, cheaper, and doesn't randomly die.
It stop working after three months  The laptop ran decently for the three months I had it then one day I came back from class and it wouldn't come on. The only thing I download to that laptop was Anti-Virus software. I took it to a computer repair shop today and they told me that there was nothing they could do to make it come on. The company I bought this laptop from should give me my money back.
Disappointed!  The computer had so many viruses on it before it was even turned on for the first time that it could not finish the initial setup.
SONY VAIO=P.O.S.  i promised myself not to buy sony after the first laptop i bought 3 years back had a terrible battery life, was slow, acceptd no extra memory etc. going for the extra RAM i went for the Vaio again late in 09 and once again, the battery sucks, i believe the supplier, TechnoIntelligence which gave me relatively good customer service, did not supply the backup discs. i will add that the non-sony box gave the impression i was being sent a clone or a refurbished item which they deny but who knows....) and finally it broke down miserably and which took a computer technitian over 24 hours of intense labor to get running again with 7 this time as it would not take Vista. Now its working fine but the controls for the bar are no longer working.... in any event, i paid too much for this HEAVY laptop with basically no battery power. Got me twice Sony. Enjoy this last time....  Lenovo here i come.
Terrible computer  This is the worst laptop I've ever owned. The processor is extremely slow and shockwave crashes constantly. I wouldn't recommend this as even a starter computer.  It's just a waste of money.
GREAT PRICE BUT SLOW  Love Lenovo so I thought I was getting a steal at $199. w free shipping. what a dog, soooo slow. that being said if you have a great aunt or someone on a budget this might work out well. me, I build and own powerful and fast computers and I find this one hard to use.
Ehh.  I got it and it did mostly work, just not for me.
So this computer where do I begin....the little things that are pesky i guess. The light on the key board does not come on when you first start up. There is no light on it to tell you if you have cap lock on or not. Bigger you say, you have to restart it half the time just to log on internet, it is way slow on start up. it freezes from time to time, hard reboot time. Spend the extra dollars for a better brand name is what I say it is worth a few hundred dollars to do so.
Lucky it gets a star for WIndows 8 .. BUT .. Windows 8 Pro  on Windows 8 .. gaming is awesome .. i get 120 FPS .... but once i installed Window 8 pro ...

got this Laptop for my son for xmas and he loved it and in july it was doing some update and just never came back on again???? what a waste of money.
False description:  In product details states that there is a CD/DVD drive, and there is not at all. The USB ports don't read any flashdrives or printers.
After begging to Lenovo's poor customer service  This product was a disaster from day 1. After begging to Lenovo's poor customer service, I was able to replace it with a new one. But, I am disppointed to say the second one was a disaster too. It was getting so hot that it would burn my hand. Today, I threw it to garbage. I wasted $800 of my money. Will never buy any of Lenovo's products.
Build quality is suspect - broke one week after warranty expired.  I was an early adopter of this laptop - having purchased it a few weeks after release without many reviews. I've had it just over one year now. I was aware of some of its alleged shortcomings (related to the prior version of the laptop, failure to install additional ram, etc.) but overall was just in need of a good quality non-mac ultrabook. Happily, for the most part, the ATIV Book 9 worked very well as an ultrabook - nice keyboard, good crisp monitor good colors, sufficient ram, snappy response and otherwise a good build quality.  However, the computer has a 1 year warranty - and the computer's top portion of the case (behind the monitor) started separating from the internal frame of the laptop at literally 12 months and 1 week. It appears to be a failure in the type of glue that is used to secure the laptop together. The laptop no longer closes in a normal fashion, and the case is separating from the laptop and bulging in the back. It will eventually break and I'll have to replace the laptop. I would recommend staying away from this one. There are plenty of other ultrabooks to consider.. and I can't believe that I'm the only one with this problem. It will likely occur with increasing frequency.
Defective after 3.5 Months!  Laptop worked great--for less that four months. Now two inches of the left side of the screen looks like a bar code and the machine freezes after 2-3 minutes.  I'll be tied up on the phone with Dell tomorrow morning when I should be at work!
Worst 'computer' ever  This is more like a toy. Very slow, little memory, can't download much.  My kids will not  even use it.
Waste waste waste  No customer should buy this product once again I have invested 1643$ on this but I missed that item when is was requested for the refund they even not responded for this request waste customer service from amazon
No battery access  Powerful and much lighter than my last MSI. However, soon after it arrived, it developed Win 10 problems with sleep and wake functions. This led me to discover that you cannot access the battery in this model. A $1500 laptop which will only last as long as the battery- in my experience about 2yrs? Shameful. Should have sent it back.
Overall a bad choice  The only good thing i can say about this laptop is that it looks good. They call it a amd turion 64 but it comes loaded with only 32 and you have to download the other 32 if you can find out where. The hard drive is configured for split fat 32 instead of ntfs. The resolution is 1680 x 1050 and that makes every thing super small and hard to read. I didn't think about resolution when i bought mine. I still cant figure out what this resolution is good for. Its not good for gaming or surfing the internet. The display screen is very dim set on the brightest setting. The bluetooth mouse seems to work only when it feels like it. The sound is terrible and has static. I bought mine sight unseen and am very disapointed with it. It has a very high price for such a low performing machine.
The performance is too bad which is the reason i returned the product.
no good  Doesnt work still waiting on replacement seller was very nice hopefully I receive soon
When it works it is great but giving two stars for unhelpful customer service  When it works it is great but giving two stars for unhelpful customer service... After an unpleasant experience, Im looking at other brands
NEVER AGAIN  Well I gave an honest review about a mac I bought and I got 29 negative feedbacks so it is clear that Mac goes around and berates anyone who says their products aren't the best and not even God himself should ever question that fact.  Lol, i tell you of the 15 computers I have owned in my life, the one time i decide to invest in an expensive laptop, it was a mac, and it was the worst computer I have ever owned.  Slow and has the arrow keys broken out of the gate, and apparently many many Macs have the same problem.  DON'T BUY A MAC, BUY A PC AND FOR 1/2 THE PRICE YOU WILL GET TWICE THE COMPUTER.  NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER BUY A POS LIKE THESE MAC'S.
The Laptop is great. However there's a HUGE issue with it that ruined it for me. Once I opened the package - it had untouched seals - and to my surprise, one of the keys (Arrow towards the right side) was left loose. It happens that this part doesn't come with the pieces of white plastic that make the junction between the key and the main board (sorry, I don't know the name for these parts). The key appears to just have been put in its slot, without any other care to attach it to the rest of the computer. Asus customer support is not helping at all and claim that warranty is not valid in Mexico City where I leave and where someone brought me the package. So I'm left with a brand new $900 laptop with a missing key and no one who actually care... Unbelievable!
Extremely dissatisfied - The computer was a Christmas gift and it didn't work.  It was an incredible hassle:  buying a new one in a store, returning the one I ordered, and getting a refund.
Not user friendly at all  We bought this for our daughter for Christmas, mostly for games and kid stuff so she would stay off of our laptops.  She was so excited to open it but we quickly found out it is not user friendly at all.  Not compatible with the games she likes (Minecraft, etc).  Would love to return but unfortunately it is too late.  Very disappointed.
Much to my regret, it's a piece of junk.  The computer occasionally hangs and won't shut off.  The delete key in the lower-right corner of the keyboard is malfunctioning.  Need I say more?
Expensive paperweight  What a disappointment! I can hardly use this laptop for all the little things that go wrong with it. It's not like it crashes all the time or fails to run software - rather, it runs software, and opens files, all over the place without my wanting it to. As the other reviewer mentioned, moving one's hand over the pad even very very lightly often causes another program to load, or another file to open. And other times, dragging one's finger or finger all over the pad forcefully produces no response from the computer at all. The machine's interaction with Windows 7's software governing DVDs makes watching a movie on this computer nigh on impossible. It is so frustrating!! On top of all this, ASUS themselves provided only one bit of assistance over the phone - it made things a bit better once I downloaded a better "mouse" software, but still, the computer remains pretty much just an expensive paperweight. Never again - I'm so sorry I threw good money away on this.
cant do anything with it  cant receive e-mails cant update software nothing works except dvd
If you get a bad product, good luck getting it fixed correctly  I am giving this 2 stars for the about 2 months that it actually worked. Long story short I will be having to send it in for a 3rd time to be fixed under warranty and would not recommend buying from ASUS due to their slow and poor warranty repair service...  I bought this laptop in April so I could work out any issues before I moved in August and it worked great at first. Then I started getting Windows blue screens almost constantly, with different error codes every time. Basic troubleshooting after calling support didn't fix the issue, so I sent it in for repair under warranty. Their fix was to reload the operating system. I was skeptical, and sure enough the issues started again, but worse, to the point I couldn't even get to the desktop because it continually crashed and tried to restart. I called support again and they had me send it back. I just got it back, and I figured out from the replacement part number that they replaced the motherboard, and so far it seems to work. HOWEVER, there is now only 4 GB of RAM when the product originally had 8 GB! I will be unable to send it back for several weeks due to moving, but I did call support to report the issue in a timely manner. The support rep created a repair ticket and said I could call back when I had an address for the shipping label, so at least their support people are professional and thoughtful.  I have heard a lot of good things about ASUS products, but it appears they are only great when they work and if they don't you will have a terrible time getting them fixed. If they could just send me the extra memory I could fix it myself, but it appears their process only allows the product to be sent in. I will not be likely to buy from ASUS again.
Terrible ram have had it for about a year wifi receiver is DisFunctional now "does not connect to wifi at all". Yah it was great when I first had it but now I don't even use it because the hard disk dosesnt hold anything. Maybe a good laptop for surfing online. Understandable for only a 200$ laptop but still I should of got a better laptop
Computer came to me all scratched up and with no operating system loaded inside of it ridiculous.
Is my HP 15.6-inch Laptop 15 still under warranty? There's a line down the middle of the screen that I can't remove. It's very aggervating.
Reliability is poor  Just shuts off and restarts randomly. Crashes repeatedly for no apparent reason whenever it is slightly touched
Only lasted a month then died, would not boot!
My computer won't connect to the internet
If you want to waste $700, This is your crap-top  Wow, just... Wow Of course not in a good way. I have had this piece of garbage for about 6 months and it is horrid. I have had an acer before and I liked it somewhat, but it was just for online gaming and stuff (my first laptop) But as it got older, I needed to upgrade. I used a Toshiba (great laptop by the way) then I stumbled upon this. I thought it was great, but at the time I had little technology knowledge and my brother helped me pick this one out. But about 2 months in, I realized I just wasted a good $700. I was furious because I could have spent it on PC parts to build my own (I didn't know how to build a PC at the time). This thing can BARLEY run Garry's mod, a very easy game to run; and often found my Intel driver crashing. I tried to update it a couple days ago, but figured out this was a locked CPU with no upgrade ability. It's touchpad was also horrible, with no right or left click, and sometimes didn't even detect my clicks or my finger gliding along. Overall, I hate this crap-top. If you want to have an actual gaming PC, build your own. Yes, you are loosing some benefits of a laptop, but you are getting so much more graphics and gameplay horsepower.
Do not buy an ASUS laptop  The hinge mechanism is faulty workmanship. I bought the laptop in August 2013. The hinge broke and because it is molded to the LCD, ASUS is expecting me to pay $165 as well as shipping ($30.00) for the repair. ASUS will not stand by its warranty even though the hinge initially broke after my owning it only 2 weeks. I have never written a negative review before. However, my frustration with ASUS is extremely high. Repeated emails from a local computer repair man, who is officially sanctioned by ASUS for repairs, have not resulted in anything. He, also, has decided to break all ties with ASUS after this incident.
Lack of printing to a local printer is a deal killer.
I hate this PC  I bought this PC three weeks ago and I regret purchasing it. I have been using PCs for over 30 years and I initially found it hard to understand how a computer with 6 GB of RAM could freeze so frequently. This was annoying, but four days ago the hard drive crashed. Although Dell replaced the drive the following day, the repair man left without checking that the laptop functioned properly. I found I could no longer connect to the internet and Microsoft Office had not been installed. I was on the phone for three hours to a guy in India before the laptop was fully operational.  Another thing I don't like is the plastic finish which shows marks and has to be cleaned often. It also comes with Windows 8 which is awful. An operating system used to be a means of getting quickly to the programs that you want to use. A PC is just a tool, you should be able to operate it easily. With Windows 8 you have to stumble around until you get the hang of it. It is not intuitive. You can be typing a memo in Word and hit the wrong key and you are in another program, it is a real pain. Microsoft 7 was fine, so why change it?  You can get a free download of 8.1, which I am told is just like Windows 7. Unfortunately I received error messages when I tried to download it. I tried again after the new hard drive was installed but I discovered that I do not have Administrator Privileges and gave up. Other people seem to have this problem but the answers on the web are convoluted and not very convincing.  Back in the 1980s we used to be able to build very complicated financial models with 256 KB of Ram but Microsoft has consistently added bells and whistles to its programs that nobody really needs, or has the time to find out how to use properly. In my twenties I would scour the manuals but life is too short. Doing simple things has become more complicated and less efficient.  This is my first Dell and my last.
Prroduct was defective  A thin vertical  line appeared down the right side of the screen within hours after first use. Also, the hinges were loose so the screen often fell forward without being touched. Product was returned. Extremely disappointed with this purchase.
Samsung Support It is the worst laptop support I have ever experienced!!!  Product came problematic. Giving blue screens every time I put the laptop in sleep. Support takes it back for 19 days and it comes back with the same problem (You have to ship it and they ship it back).  They tell me they need to have 3 unsuccessful repairs to replace the laptop!!! This makes about 19x3 days without your laptop for samsung to admit that they sold you a problematic product and need to give you a new one.
Don't Waste Your Money on 8 GB of Ram  Alright, so Apple decided to make it so that you cannot add more memory.  Their software updates require more memory to operate, therefore, after so many updates... your memory becomes obsolete and you are stuck with a hunk of junk that frequently stalls, freezes, sounds really noisy... and starts to act a lot like a PC.  I frequently have to "restart" the device to get it to stop behaving badly.  It has aggrevated me for the absolute last time.  I have my Email and Chrome running... that's it.  Everything else that's running is minor and not a major application.  I might have 5-10 tabs open at a time on my Chrome.  My macbook sounds like it's going to burst into flames and it gets very very hot.  I cannot believe that this computer cost so much money.  Apple, you failed.
This is not an easy fix.  1 year later and the Monitor comes unplugged all the time. This is not an easy fix....is a piece of junk.....
He like it.  fast delivery, that is my son birthday gift. He like it. But, it is  broken after 3 month due to hard drive problem missing boot device not found  code 03F0 .
didn't like it  Not for me
HP = Horrible Problem  Never buy a computer or anything from HP.  I've had a HP printer, Camera and the HP Pavilion and none of them worked right for more than a month, then components start failing.  HP products are a total rip off and their computer hardware is garbage, the battery sucks, the keys and trackpad are anything but responcive and it's sluggish as hell.  Avoid HP, HP-Compaq, Compaq like the plague.  What did the HP/Compaq merger accomplish you wonder.  They still release the same garbage Compaq and HP systems but instead of HP's sub par junk hardware they use Compaq's bottem of the barrell hardware, then they designed an ultimate piece of junk the HP-Compaq series.  Crap + Crap = Crap.
Several keys stopped working a few months after purchasing. Lenovo said it was out of warranty and my "Square Trade" two year extended warranty said to deal with the manufacturer who doesn't want to fix it.
Be warned in advance !  This is another poor model from Toshiba made for first time buyers. Let me give 12 reasons to buy it, 1. You want a laptop. 2. You don't have much money to spend. 3. You don't care about its 45 mins battery life. 4. You don't want or don't care for performance. 5. You have never heard of USB 2.0 or Firewire or Bluetooth. 6. You don't care for the noise or heat it will generate. 7. You don't care about system instability and overheating problems. 8. You don't care for graphics performance. 9. You don't want to play any PC games. 10. You don't care about its 8 pound weight or big size. 11. You don't care about irritating and nosiy Hard Disk. 12. You are a student and will install Linux on it anyways ! Let me give you 12 reasons NOT to buy it, 1. Uses a desktop Celeron processor (very cheap), not Mobile Celeron or Mobile Pentium. This means laptop will get very hot, its fan will be very noisy, will use too much power and have much lower performance. 2. No USB 2.0, firewire or wirless access. What use is 1.5 GHz processor if you can't connect it to any other device at any reasonably fast speed ? Will you wait for an hour to burn a CD on a external CD-RW connected to an old USB 1.1 port on this ? 3. It bigger and bulkier than previous models. Again this is partly because of a desktop Celeron being used in this. Desktop CPU means more space for cooling it down etc. 4. Uses a slower memory speed, way below today's standard. Again this notebook won't have any fast performance with mp3 or multimedia stuff because of this. You will even have trouble finding the memory at this low speed when upgrading ! 5. The keyboard isn't same a desktop, so keys are placed at different positions, some missing. But this might a case with most laptops though. 6. The touchpad isn't very great. You will end up buying a USB mouse. 7. Doesn't have older serial port, PS2 ports etc. Nor does it have any thing like Bluetooth or Firewire or USB 2. Yes you can buy a PCMCIA card for say wireless access or USB 2 or Bluetooth. But there's only on PCMCIA slot in it ! 8. Because desktop Celeron runs so hot, you won't be able to use it a "lap"-top to avoid burning your skin. Beleive it gets very very hot ! 9. The hard disk is much slower rpm and smaller in size. And it makes just too much noise. 10. Toshiba doesn't even include a Windows XP CD. All it has is a recovery CD to reformat the whole disk and re-install everything all over again & deleting all your data. Its horrible SW bundle, nothing worth a penny in it. Norton is only trial offer. Not even XP is included properly. 11. The new battery lasts around 45 mins on full charge. Who knows how much will it last for when it becomes old. Again cheap desktop Celeron has a major part to play in this. 12. Finally Toshiba doesn't make or design this laptop. Its designed/made by a cheap contractor in Taiwan and then sold as Toshiba brand. This is the truth, you can do some google search to verify this ! If you don't have lots of cash or urgent need for mobility you might wanna reconsider having the good old PC for now. Don't be mislead by Intel 1.2GHz label on it. There are reasons why Toshiba can sell it for so cheap and hopefully you enough not to regret later on.
I was very disappointed in this laptop  I've  had hp laptops before.  This one drove my crazy. Windows 8 is so completely different than Windows 7. I felt like I needed a manual just for the operating system. The word prediction with the on screen keyboard didn't work well.  It  would never complete a word.  I returned it and a friend fixed my old hp laptop instead.
Acer is the worst computer company  Acer kept my older laptop for a month in for repair before they told me they didn't have the part to fix it (a part available online from many many vendors for cheap).  I wouldn't have even known they couldn't fix it until I went through two chats and a phone call with their support (ALL giving me different information).  They would have kept it indefinitely.  Short answer: DO NOT BUY FROM THIS TERRIBLE COMPANY.  THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS.  Their only solution was for me to purchase a brand new computer from them.
Buy if you are looking for  a headache.  I've had this product two months now and I really regret the purchase. The only positive thing I can say is that it has a small surface area and fits in my camera bag,  and the ability to use as a pad is great. Otherwise,  the problems are so many.  First,  it takes forever to charge -  approximately 4 times as long as my MacBook Air. And that doesn't correspond with a longer than  average battery life.  Plus  even when closed and not in use it drains Power more quickly than my mac.  The mouse pad is so jumpy it's almost unusable  -  it's constantly maximizing and minimizing things and switching between programs with the slightest brush. Then,  there are certain programs that spontaeously turn on and resist closing.  Finally,  the screen sensitivity is inconsistent. It is often very hard to use the kindle app because the screen refuses to respond to certain touches without being entirely restarted.  Such a headache and waste of money.
Screen is way to reflective!  I used a friends account to buy this item because they had free shipping from prime. Purchased around March 1st 2015. The screen is impossibly reflective making the image difficult to see in all but optimal light settings. Touching the screen causes a very noticeable finger print grease mark that is exacerbated by the high contrast screen. The processing speed is not anything special. The keyboard is a little on the noisy side and the touch pad buttons are very stiff and quite loud if you're trying to use this computer in a classroom type of setting. The keyboard does not light up either, which I didn't realize and I miss. Additionally, I downloaded the latest version of word for homework assignments and have had the program freeze up 3 times where I lost everything. Yes, I was saving intermittently, but when the program rebooted only the title of the document remained (not the content). Granted this could be an issue only having to do with word or the operating system or the combination. My feeling is that the choices for any laptops in the $400 price range is pretty awful. I wish I had either spent closer to $300 or gone up to the $600 range. The battery life has been pretty good though with the brightness turned down.
Awesome display, super fast, but totally dead after less than 2 Yrs. many issues. AVOID!!  UPDATE 3/25/18: After less than two years, this thing completely died on me this morning. Came here to see the price is now $20 more than when I bought it in May 2016. Incessant screen flickers worsened over time, shuts down/off randomly, hinges went lax a long time ago so the screen flops backwards any time I pick up this clunky overpriced paperweight. The power jack also came loose in the last 3 months so the power cable fell out of it constantly while charging. Worst computer Ive ever used!! DO NOT BUY. I got my fiance the newer titanium Acer 14 last year and its far and away a superior machine. Avoid this POS at all costs :(  11/16/16: I unfortunately had to dock a star, for 3 reasons: A.) The battery life is definitely not as advertised. It's only been about 6 months but there has been a noticeable decline in the time between charges. As others have stated, 6 or 7 hours is about what you get with regular browsing, NOT 9 hours. B.) I, too, have started getting the dreaded black-screen flickers at random. It usually occurs with multiple tabs open, while switching between them. It occurs infrequently, but still troublesome. C.) The screen latches have weakened and sometimes the Chromebook ends up totally flat. There does not appear to be a way to tighten them so they hold their position.  ------------------------------------------------  Absolutely love this Chromebook, had it for a few months now and no problems at all. It has completely spoiled me! :) Boots up in less than 10 seconds, battery life is fantastic (but I usually keep the display brightness under 50%, a habit I have developed from trying to save battery life on my phone); the display is vibrant and crisp, which makes me glad I splurged for the true HD since many Chromebooks do not have true HD resolution and can be harsh on the eyes after extended periods of use. It's quite large - larger than I would have liked, truthfully - but it's not a deal-breaker by any means. Keyboard is nicely spaced and responsive, trackpad is tricky to use if you are not already acclimated to using a clickable trackpad (I still struggle with this even now). It is very fast, never had an issue with lagging or crashing of any kind, even with a ton of browser tabs open. I was also pleasantly surprised by the quality of the speakers, even at max volume - it boasts a nice, crisp clear sound; very little distortion to speak of. I also receive a consistent stream of updates, so its nice to see that the software is being tweaked and refined on a regular basis. Perfect for what Chromebooks do best - flawless internet browsing without the fear of viruses and all that jazz =)
it's just beautiful, bass is terrible  it's just beautiful,bass is terrible,worse than earbuds price by 10$.just one sata ports,how could i add another SSD?it takes nearly 2 minutes startover.i am sure MSI laptop is much better
Too many problems with my MS Office docs and my pictures.  Do not like this Chromebook and am sorry I spent money on it!!
HP Laptops Poor Quality, Poor Support  My HP zt1170 had the backlight on the LCD go out. Its just over a year old and just off warranty. They wanted almost $800 for the repair, but we settled for $577. Since that fix the LCD has failed twice and the hard drive crashed and had to be replaced. Fix #1 lasted 2 weeks. Fix #2 lasted only 2 months and they tried to stick me for another $649 by claiming I physically damaged/cracked the LCD which voided the warranty. Their word against mine, but I watched the LT fail each time and told them either they're lying or it was damaged in transit. I've spent countless hours on hold writing letters trying to communicate with Indian tech support with limited english language skills. I finally got them to repair my LT, but I feel like with the poor reliability history that its days may be numbered. If it dies again then I'm cutting my losses and scrapping it. HP is poor quality and support that at best is contemptuous of the customer
White Screen/Support not helpful  Ive had this notebook for one month primarily for streaming videos, web surfing and emailing. This morning the screen turned white and now I can get anything else on the screen. I used ASUS chat support first which was extremely unhelpful, and phone support second which informed me I would need to pay myself to ship it in for repair and be without a computer for weeks. For the month it did work, it streamed well from Netflix, but not from other streaming services I use. I would not recommend this product.
Don't economize, you'll be dissapointed!  I bought this to replace my GF's 8 year old Toshiba.  It has 4 cores instead of 2, and a faster processor speed, but there is no apparent difference in computing power or speed.  The display screen is second rate.  Highlights and shadows have opposite color casts, making correct adjustment impossible. Contrast is very poor.  The wifi adapter does not play well on my network.  Even after driver updates and adjustments it is slow, slow, slow and I'm going to replace it at my expense.  Just to make the system usable I upgraded to an SSD and 16 gigs of main memory. Now it is as good as the 8 year old Toshiba.  We kept it because returns of computers are a hassle and because it has an additional usb port, hdmi and an SD card reader, three things the Toshiba lacked.  Also kept it because it has Windows 7.  Buy a better computer than this or don't buy one at all.
Great for kids but that's it.  The pre-loaded bloats where causes this unit to load and start up slowly not perfect for college students or business.
Terrible computer, ridiculously slow even as an entry level. Very disappointed.
Out there in never, never land!  I don't know how I will like it - after over two weeks of waiting for the laptop it still is out there in pony express land!  Evidently  Amazon 'Prime' doesn't apply to deliveries!
I am returning this dude  I bought it online a month ago while I was traveling. I was very anxious to go home and use it since I thought that it was good laptop for a good price: 1100.  Day 1: its light and looks nice. Day 2: Overheats, very noisy, fan does not stop working even if the computer is idle. Day 3: hard drive sounded like it was grinding (still does from time to time) which worried me a lot so I started backing up my data every day. Day 4: the built in webcam SUCKS. When you try to use it on Yahoo, MSN, or even try to turn it on using its program, it says: Cam is being used by another program. And when you try to find that other program, you hit the wall.  Now after a month, it is still light and still looking nice, still overheats, fan does not stop, hard drive grinds something God knows what, and the webcam is still being used by another application.  I have had it with it and with Toshiba, I can return it, so I will as soon as I get another one, probably the Dell XPS. Maybe the XPS is little expensive, but it is worth it. I have had very good experience with Dell: 3 Laptops they were all great. I have also used 3 Toshibas; I have never had a good experience with any of them. And by the way: Vista also SUCKS.  Bottom line: Avoid this Junk, and avoid Toshiba laptops in general.
Really wanted to love it, but can't  I love Apple products. I've had iPod Touch (4th Gen) and iPod Shuffle, and they were great. I was also loving my Macbook Air until it broke down three months after I bought it. It suddenly died when the mainboard burned. This was really unexpected, since the most I do with my computer is watching YouTube videos and some typing. Now it has been 8 months, and it makes weird buzzing/scratchy noises when I play audio/video. They replaced my speakers, but it still is not fixed. I'm a very careful user (it does not have any scratches, and I never dropped it).
volume stopped working twice!!  I bought this computer in July 2016. The volume stopped working twice so far. Once in November and now again in January. Lonovo's support center has been very helpful. both times it took over an hour on the phone and them remoting in to the computer to try and solve the issue. then it was determined that we would have to mail in the computer. very annoying to have to deal with this issue on a new computer.
Slow dud of a brick  This thing is sooooo slow.  Very quickly, it stopped charging.  SquareTrade would not honor their contract because they said it was under warranty and not an accident, so you're better off smashing the screen before trying to return it.
Still set up for the previous owner never again will I buy this  This product is never something that I would buy again. When I first received the computer I turned it on and it acted like it was setting up but then after you got through putting your Wi-Fi it went right back to the school district that had prior
be aware !!  who said that every body knows about computers ? And this it's not a lap top, it's a tablet !! for me was a unpleasant surprise and a wasted of my money ! I'm so angry !
Windows 7 Pro fails!  After just two weeks Windows suddenly fails to start.  Worked this morning but now....nothing.  BIOS seems OK.  Error says Windows could not access something it needed to start.  I'm suspecting the Kernal.  Trying to contact the vendor but for now, this thing has really ticked me off.
Flimsy keyboard  On the positve side, this has a good battery that when recharged will last several hours.  However, the keys on the keyboard respond slowly.  When I place the cursor within a sentence, it usually does not show up. Instead, it highlights the whole word after the insertion point or the entire sentence within the insertion point. It forces me to delete the highlighted word as I type, add in the info I wish to insert, and then re-type the highlighted word. If I repeatedly click in the insetion point for 10 or more times, it will work.  This is very frustrating and slows me down considerably. I would recommend testing for this with any Vaio.
It sucked horrible the logic board and graphics card and Fan gave out on 2 weeks in to having it.
0 stars  Horrible. Extremely slow, asked for a refund, had to order a new card with my money on it, took 15 dollars off for "restocking fee".
I think it is something with this particular laptop becuase I highly doubt that win10 have bad drivers for integrated graphics  I have huge problem. Intel graphics after I installed win10 and proper win10 drivers constantly stopping working. I think it is something with this particular laptop becuase I highly doubt that win10 have bad drivers for integrated graphics.
Careful!  Obviously used when I received it and had a number of problems right out of the box. My keyboard would randomly stop working and often it would take 5 or more restarts to get my MacBook Air fully operational. When it is on and working it is fantastic and perfect. When it is not, it is borderline useless and a waste of nearly $1000.
I bought this to replace a 4 year old laptop expecting better performance than this!  Incredibly SLOW! I bought this to replace a 4 year old laptop expecting better performance than an aged, outdated machine. Instead, Web pages took a long time to load, emails took a long time to load, I found myself waiting 3-5 seconds every time I clicked a button. Used Skype for a call and it crashed 5 times in an hour with no other apps running, image froze repeatedly, sound dropped. Had nothing to do with my Internet connection as I fired up my old laptop and despite its age and problems it was significantly faster than this brand new out-of-the-box device. I compared them side by side doing the same things. Not sure if it is Windows 10 or what but this device is unusable! Packing it up straight away to return!!!
DOA  Product arrived DOA.  Hard drive was bad but I did not have any trouble returning it.
Didn't work  This came in the mail late (UPS fault). Upon charging, the screen was blank. It doesn't work and come to find out this is a common problem. Will have to send it back and hopefully get a product that works. I will update this when that happens. Very disappointed that something that is brand new doesn't even function properly despite the good reviews about it performance.
Hardware Failure after 2 years.  Purchased on June 3, 2015.  Received hardware failure message on 28 Oct 2017 and the laptop wouldn't boot  Contacted ASUS helpdesk and they said it seemed like a hardware issue.  Recycling it. 1st Asus product to have failed after 15 years. (I have 4 laptops, 3 external monitors and 1 desktop).  Won't be purchasing this model/line in the future.
Very disappointed  I was pretty disappointed with this product. All the specs seemed great for the price of the computer, but upon turning on the pic, the "repair hard disk" diagnostic started running. For me, a new computer would never have that running upon startup. Besides that, I was really disappointed with the exterior finish, the key pad, and the keyboard. From the photo, it appears to have a modern "MacBook" type finish, but in reality, the keys and keypad are not smooth stroke and very rigid, it feels like a lot cheaper computer than it is.
Unit was defective.  Unit was defective on arrival: it would power itself off with no warning at random intervals, without providing any information about the issue. After three weeks of contacting the manufacturer's tech support, they asked me to box it and send it in to replace the motherboard. Since I was still within Amazon's return period, I decided to get a refund instead.
Description is not correct  Bought because of touchscreen feature - it is not.
Great looking laptop  Great looking laptop, but the battery is the biggest issue and without it, it becomes a $1500 paperweight.  I can leave it plugged in, but that will add to the heat issues.  It has died twice in two years of ownership.  The first time it died was after 6 months of use then again a year later when both the computer and battery were out of warranty.  Dell would not replace it despite that being an absurdly short lifespan for their batteries.  The culprit could be heat.  This computer pumps out an enormous amount of it and even though they say it has excellent cooling, it doesn't.  After use, it can burn your legs.  Second problem are the USBs.  They are ultra sensitive and whatever is plugged into it can become unplugged just by tapping it.  They also don't work well with some devices, which maybe an issue with the device itself (I'm looking at you Samsung Galaxy).  Keyboard is pushed too far forward so resting your forearms on the front of the computer hurts like hell when you have been playing for a bit.  This computer would be 4 stars if the battery didn't die once a year.  I have an ASUS ROG laptop from 2010 and the battery still works 6 years later.  No excuse for this Dell.
DO NOT BUY THIS.  This is the worst, most useless computer. I bought it because it seemed like a good deal; instead, I'll have to spend even more money buying a second laptop. It's given me nothing but problems since I bought it. I believed that, since I use my computer almost exclusively for word processing, this little RAM wouldn't be an issue. I was wrong. It is an unbelievably slow computer. Beyond its horrendous layout - why is the mouse ever-so-slightly off-center? Why is the keyboard set so far back? - it simply is not functional. I've owned this computer for about six months and the cursor just stopped working. It also has been randomly deleting my files. Worst Amazon buy I've had by a mile.
slow  Its a paper weight now....better off spending more money for a more up to date computer ..trust me...wouldn't recommend never
Read this one  Bought 1 in January screen is now black bought one in July and sound doesn't work very disappointed in the quality
Not Satisfied  This laptop has got the worst trackpad possible. There is a weird sound comes up everytime you touches the Trackpad. It makes it look like a local product made of cheap products. Check the below link for the Track pad problem. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gl_j3IWqR0 Worst thing happened to me was I bought it from Computer Upgrade King. I raised a return request as soon as I recieved the laptop but Computer Upgrade King charged me 23 dollars for Shipping it back to them.
the mouse pad doesn't work. I had to buy a mouse just to log in for the first time.
Garbage!  Save your money  This laptop is garbage.  Poorly constructed, horrible keyboard.  Operating system crashed after 2 months and now I need to wipe computer clean and reinstall.  If you purchase this be sure to get the insurance for 150 more dollars because you will need it.  Absolute waste of money
hate it waste of money  I hate the Ubuntu program it is not user friendly. Also I cant print  from it and thats why I bought it. The printing drivers are terrible. I ended up not using it at all. What a waste of money and I'm retired so every penny counts.
Bad experience  After use of ~14 months windows won't come up, tried all the possible ways to restore it and everything failed. I did some investigation and it looks like the hard drive is corrupted. When i was looking for a laptop, Dell was my first option...not anymore.
Screen is awful  Very disappointed with the screen when used for gaming.  I saw similar sentiments in other reviews but figured I would take a chance.  That was a mistake.  The colors are atrociously washed out and it looks like you are viewing the screen through a dense fog if you can find a remotely usable viewing angle.  Color shifts drastically with even the slightest change of the angle.  Otherwise, i was pleased with the laptop.  Unfortunately, the screen is so horrifically bad I cannot even imaging looking at it for 5 minutes, much less the next few years.
Nothing was set up and there was more bloatware than useful utilities. I returned it almost immediately  This laptop was made cheaply. The laptop would bend inwards when I was typing on the keyboard as if there were no reinforcements behind the top plastic. Nothing was set up and there was more bloatware than useful utilities. I returned it almost immediately. Worst product I have purchased on Amazon so far.
this pc froze and never worked from the on-start.
This thing is a piece of junk! Do NOT buy it. Despite all my research it's slower than dial up. It's clunky and Windows 10 is extremely lame. I didn't think the lack of back lighting would be a big deal but it was. There's nothing about it that's not lame. I got used to using a Mac for so long I didn't think a cheap PC would so crappy. I'm never complaining about Mac again and may never get another PC for as long as I live because of this hunk of junk. I can't do anything on it. The pages barely load. The internet connection cuts out continuously but not any of the other devices or computers in the house. I barely got my foot in the door with this so I doubt I'll be putting allot of info on it or relying on it for anything.
adaptor not charging but still can use when  the adapter connected to the outlet ....
No choice but to return.  Couldn't fix that crazy wifi issue where range is almost nil, even after following online directions.  Sony's own community message boards were over 160 pages last I checked a few weeks ago, full of people complaining about it, and no fix posted from Sony themselves, just user workarounds.
MSI = Frustration Machine.  I've had this machine for about 6 months....I have to say..I hate MSI with a passion.  This piece of junk computer is nothing but a frustration machine.  Crashes on the most simplest of tasks.  Overheats like crazy..Turns the whole room hot.  Keyboard layout is ridiculous..they jammed a couple of keys together.  The delete key is on top of the number pad.  The keys are smaller and round making it hard to type.  You have to use 2 hands to adjust volume and brightness jammed on the arrow keys....This was my first and last MSI product....never again.  I bought this from Fry's electronics so couldn't return within 45 days.  I will never buy another MSI product again.  Even the most basic games runs like crap on this frustration machine.  Look elsewhere....
DO NOT BUY- SCREEN WILL FAIL  ***UPDATE 5/7/17*** DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER! I thought at first it was a great deal, and worth all the time I spent saving money too get it, but now I realize just how WRONG I was. The screen on the first computer I got developed a line of dead pixels the week I got it. I returned it to amazon, and so that was sorted out. The new one though, got a new dead pixel LESS THAN TWO MONTHS LATER. I sent it in for repair, and got it replaced under manufacturers warranty. Now, today I boot up my laptop and what do I see? I see ANOTHER SCREEN PROBLEM ON MY <1 MONTH OLD SCREEN. There are now pixelated lines of green running across the right side of my computer, when all it's done is sit on my desk! And, all this is not even to mention that the 3mm headphone jack recently stopped responding. Overall, I have to say that the terrible build quality of this computer makes it not worth even $500, much less the $800 I spent. Would not buy again, and WILL NOT recommend. ***Original Review*** I like this computer. It's a great budget deal, even cheaper now than when I bought, and it runs all of the games I wanted it to. While it isn't top of the line even now, it runs new games very well on medium or high settings. I would definitely recommend updating your drivers right away though, as that makes the computer run better. There was however was rather major problem. The first one that I got worked great for two days, and then I turned it on only to see 3 lines of dead pixels. Of course I returned it, and amazon sent a new one out. This one has been working great, up until a few days ago when I noticed a dead pixel on the new one as well. It is very distracting, especially when I am trying to play darker games like The Forest, or watch a movie or video. Unfortunately I am about a month outside of my return window, so I'm stuck with this for a couple years until I upgrade. I hope that this review helped you make an informed decision!
I had to return the Acer to be fixed. Still waiting to get it back
Not working hard drive when it got here.
Fun and games... But not for long.  The most powerful laptop I've ever had or seen at that point, ran most recent games on stable 60 fps on Medium and High settings. I thought it was one of the best purchases I've ever done. But it was one of the worst.  After little bit over a year, I had all sorts of problems with this abomination. Hardware problems. The left hinge cracked the laptop because it was too tight. The left fan is making an incredibly high and awful noise. No one in my current house can sleep when I'm using the computer. After further research on these problems, I've seen that I'm not the only one with this hardware problems and they seem to be fairly common!  This is a very expensive laptop and it's only about 1.5 years old. I'm done with MSI laptops, and probably with gaming laptops in general.
Trackpad problem  This seems like a very well-designed Chromebook and so many of its features are appealing, which is why I bought it. But the trackpad acted a bit erratically from the start and got worse over the next few days, not responding promptly -- or at all -- when I tried to highlight text, move text, drag and drop text. One odd thing I noted: when I first began using the unit, it worked extremely well. I noticed a banner alert near the top of the screen stating that this ASUS computer was not using the current version (something like that) and to click to update. I put off doing that for a couple of hours since it seems to work so well. Finally, I clicked it. And that is when I first noticed the touchpad not responding as well. As I wrote above, the touchpad got worse over about 3 days and this morning I could barely edit a Google Doc.
Total waste of money  Complete waste of money. It doesn't even have enough internal memory for required updates so it's useless. It runs too slow to even use. We're using them as paper weights. I'd return them if I could.
The laptop was OK :(. Probably my taste is different.  I received this laptop few days back. The spec of this laptop is no double very good. However, the design is very simple and I didn't like it very much.
So sorry, I am not computer savey and Chrome OS was difficult to understand,
No good  Defiantly crappie, things given me trouble since day one, had it a couple months and now it doesn't even turn on. Only thing I ever did on it was Rosetta stone.
Too slow and locks up.  Decided to finally order a Kindle.  I just expected more out of the Acer after talking to others who had previously bought one.  I wouldn't do it again.
Not as its listed.......  I ordered this and it arrived on time however it's not a 14 inch screen it's only 11 inches.
Try before you buy-beware  Before you buy try typing fast and using the right shift key-you will hit the up arrow instead and this is super annoying. Have owned it for 1 month and trying to resell asap. This is cheaply made and the track pad/buttons work just barely well enough. It is super slow and I mean slooooooow. My rccommendation would be to keep looking-this is not worth the price.
never again  I will never buy a acer product again
Do not buy Apple products! It won't last  I have had extremely bad experiences with Apple products, they suffer from a chronic problem which is well known : overheating  The operating temperature for Apple laptops aren't designed for 30 degree C weather. Every Apple laptop I've had has died in the Summer. several times in a year. and each time due to a component bust due to heat. It just wasn't designed with heat dissipation in mind.  What's worse is that the Apple service center try to cheat you out of your warranty by blaming you of liquid spills. (Even if the LCIs aren't busted.) I got a wind of this scam when I disassembled the laptop, took pictures of the PCB and escalated it after spending hours on the crappy customer services lines.  The Apple service center in two cities even tried to charge me to take a look when the laptop was under warranty! The whole experience was despicable. It's just not worth the stress and wasted hours dealing with incompetent Apple "Geniuses".
Misleading  Lenovo produce great computers. This was advertised as Window Vista Business computer. Delivered with XP Pro. Neither seller nor Amazon honored the add. Buy from computer stores, and via agents.
SLOW.....slow.......slowwwwww  This computer is beyond slow. Even starting up safari or downloading a software update will take FOREVER. Do not be like me and be blinded by the Apple brand and pretty colors. Wait till they make this product better before you go out an purchase it. I went with the Macbook Air 11" instead and man I should've gone with that in the first place.
this was the worst purchase ive made from here. didn't work properly and eventually conqued out
No hard drive installed  The laptop was received out of the box with no hard drive. Completely unacceptable as I was unable to have it serviced where I currently live.
Laptop never worked properly. Now I have to return.  Difficult due to working FT. Very frustrating  Joan
Didn't Last  Laptop is fast and slick with a nice touch screen, but the Windows 8 seriously blows goats and it comes with a Kaspersky trial that is a trap and just loads up a bunch of adware and spyware that you have to purge from your system to restore basic functionality.  I used it gently but a key broke after about 4 months (it's in my password,) and the thing is currently a pretty pink paperweight.
Don't buy... It has Screen Problems...
Do not buy Samsung laptops  Battery died after a year and it's built into the laptop.  It will no longer charge and must be connected to the AC adapter.  Looks nice on the outside, but the quality and performance is not there.  My friend purchased many of these for a small business and all of them feel unstable.  Specs on paper do not always reflect real world results.  Samsung makes great electronics, but I cannot recommend their laptops to anyone.  *I'm a Systems Engineer and have designed and deployed images to many laptops and desktops for corporations.  It does not matter which OS w7,w8, or w10 you put on it, performance is not good.  Even with a Samsung ssd and 16gb ram, other bottlenecks in this system occur.
Bad service  I live in venezuela and buy this PC, after an anus it was not working well and the envie 4 times from my country towards Sony in USA, always me devolvian the pc of return and I never work well.  Finally the machine does not ignite and I never will to buy Sony in my life
Look Elsewhere  I'm not sure why I bought this laptop but I wish I never had. After owning this for 3 months, most of the keys stopped working on it. I sent it to Asus for warranty repair and got it back 6 weeks later and the spacebar barely works. Wouldn't you think they'd check it out after they replace the keyboard? It cost me $30 to ship this laptop and I refuse to pay another $30 again. I have to pound on the spacebar to get it to work. The spacebar of all keys. And a 6 week turnaround for repair? Never again will I buy an Asus product.
Get what you pay for.  Save a little more and get a good laptop.  Well, only one phrase comes to mind.  You get what you pay for.  This laptop was great for about 6 months.  At that point the hinges on the lid began to seize up, when you close the lid, the hinges stay where they were and they tore through the plastic on the lid. Now the lid is floating by wires literally no hinges.  My friends wife bought one also, and had the same issue in about the same amount of time.  Also whenever windows gets a new update the wireless card no longer is recognized (possibly drivers, but am too irritated to fix that).  If we would have not gotten the "gimme gimmies" we could have saved a little more for a nice laptop.  If you just need a laptop for like 6 months(ya right) this one is great lol.  Or if you don't plan to use it very often opening and closing it.  Another issue is the battery sucks, within about 3 months the battery would stay charged for about 10 mins MAXIMUM! literally, and replacement batteries are like 40-50 bucks.  I did not buy this product through Amazon, I got it at [...] new.  If you pay more you are wasting your money :P  On the bright side, it makes a heck of a paperweight, and I may be able to get a few dollars back on Ebay parting it out lol!!!!!  Bottom line, get another laptop.  Rant over.
Very Bad Battery, Not even lasts 1.5 hrs even when you fully charge.
JUNK  If you need a total piece of junk to manage your photos and email this is it. It will freeze, lock up, shut down and totally Pi$# you off. I've had numerous techs try to fix it to no avail
Not as great as I hoped.  Don't like the touch pad. It seems much less sensitive. It isn't as fast as I anticipated.  UPDATED: The hardware of this laptop is so cheap. Less than a year later and the screen has started to fail. The touch pad is still wonky. The cooling fan is so loud it is almost distracting.  Additionally for an i7 it isn't even very fast when multitasking. It almost feels sluggish.
Battery needs replacement  Battery needs replacement  I ordered this macbook air MC505LL through a friend who was visiting the US. When he brought it to Nigeria, we found out the battery condition was indicating replace now! Now we can only used this macbook air when its plugged to an electricity socket....so sad!
hinge broken  When something experiencive as zenbook 303ln we expect first of all durability. Unfortunately, not in this case. I bought it in December 28 of 2015 as new year gift)). I was gentle with it. Maybe, that's why It lasts 10 months. Does anyone know how to fix it?
Very disappointed. Also  Extremely slow. Very disappointed. Also, makes a lot of noise and the bottom of the laptop gets hot after 15 minutes. Garbage.
T100 DIED AFTER ONLY 6 DAYS.  So last night, my ASUS T100, that I hadn't even had for 5 days, abruptly shut off. The item would not power on or charge. This morning the item powered on for 5 minutes, with 40% battery life, then the tablet shut off completely. The item died after only living for 6 days. ASUS is now on my most hated list, alongside compaq and acer. At first glance, I thought ASUS would be a superb brand, they do after all make high end gaming PC, so I thought maybe a decent windows tablet would be cool to have. NOPE. Save your money and buy a more expensive brand. I intend to buy the new WACOM COMPANION 2 in a few days.
you're on your own after you hand them your money  i asked them why the battery was dead/wouldn't hold a charge.  i hadn't had a laptop before and really didn't know what the deal was.  they didn't bother to respond.
UPDATE -  BUYER BEWARE! Broken Screen Hinge, Windows Freezing, Wifi/Bluetooth Failed, POOR QUALITY! AVOID!!  Original summary: Excellent laptop - great bang for the buck!  Boots super fast.  Display looks great.  Nice tactile keyboard.  Long battery life.  Very minimal bloatware. Decent speakers. Serviceable trackpad.  Couldn't ask for anything more honestly.  I bought this for my wife because her old Toshiba Satellite A505-S6004 began to go out and cause her trouble every day. She isn't a hardcore gamer but she does enjoy playing Hearthstone.  That being said, I wanted to get her something that would could play most anything (at variable settings) should she decide to branch out and try more games.  Apart from gaming, I wanted her to have something that was going to let her perform all of the general day-to-day computing that anyone may do: email, streaming music/video, browsing the web, etc.  Of course this laptop is able to do it all with ease.  I also like that there is room to add more memory and another hard drive.  My wife and I are extremely happy with this laptop.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.  ***************************************************************************************************************** **** UPDATE: 9 MONTHS AFTER PURCHASE -- PLEASE READ UPDATED REVIEW BELOW **** *****************************************************************************************************************  I had to come back here to update my review on this Dell 15.6" Inspiron 15 7559-763BLK laptop because this thing died fast.  This laptop started off appearing to be of high quality but as time went on it failed big time.  As some others have point at, the left screen hinge is defective and broke on our unit which causes the entire left side of the laptop to open up several inches, exposing the motherboard and other internal components.  Unless you forcefully push the left side back down it remains exposed -- and good luck keeping it there.  My wife had to take some panty hose and use it to attempt to keep the thing together.  If the hinge breaking wasn't bad enough, the Wifi antenna is on the left side of the machine so apparently the stress of the hinge break and the entire left side of the machine opening up has caused the WifI antenna to get a maximum range of about 6 feet from the access point.  Additionally, the bluetooth has failed.  Apartment from the hardware issues, Windows 10 will randomly freeze for anywhere from 15 seconds to sometimes so long that you just have to hold in the power button to forcefully shut it down.  I'm a tech guy -- have my A+, Network+, MCP and several other old MS certs --  I've updated the BIOS to the very latest revision, completely wiped the SSD and done a fresh install of Windows 10 and updated all drivers to the latest version including the latest Geforce drivers which, as of today, 9/16/16 is at 372.70 (which was released on 8/29/16).  I've been working on computers for the better part of 30 years -- our unit is a total lemon and from the reports I've read from others, this entire skew is essentially garbage.  Just take a look at the 1 and 2 star reviews.  This laptop has MAJOR quality control issues.  I bought this as a gift for my wife and we're both extremely dissappointed.  I don't have any experience with this type of thing, but we are seriously considering contacting a lawyer to see if there is any possibility of legal action considering that there appears to be a high failure rate with this laptop.  I'm serious folks, stay far away from this laptop.  We're out $820 dollars, but you don't have to be.
A Piece Of Junk!  Worst purchase for which I've spent over $20, ever. Power cord has such a flimsy terminal into the computer, after a month it wouldn't seat properly to recharge. And now if you jiggle it enough to keep the charging light on, it essentially won't recharge (it's gone no higher than 65%, despite having been plugged in for days). Wouldn't waste my money on this junk again. Surprised Amazon would carry it.
It stopped working after 3 days. Seller blamed me and all I did was try to upgrade system and whole thing failed to turn back on.
I am using this laptop in the UK. When I touch the metal panel while the laptop is charging, I always feel electrical current on the top of my fingers. I am not sure if it is the charger or the laptop, or the UK socket, but it makes me worry.
Nice when it works, but....  Great laptop replacement PC, which has everything but the optical drive which can be added easily with a USB external drive.  Plenty of power and memory for speed, in addition to the SSD drive which eliminates noise, increases speed and reduces heat.  The keyboard and touch pad are especially responsive with Windows 10 gestures.  The only miscue is the backlighting of the keyboard, which blends in with the laptop's silver coloring.  Be aware that a fair amount of software updating will have to be done because this laptop ships with the original version of Windows 10, and not the anniversary update, but that's a minor irritant.  Otherwise, nicely done.  UPDATE: Unfortunately, 7 months in, this laptop has become a problem.  It has been returned to HP under warranty to fix a power issue and has been returned with the same issue.  HP now says it will escalate the matter, but that means another two-week turnaround, with no assured fix in sight.  Therefore, I can't recommend this laptop, as good as it is when it works.  My overall view is this HP laptop is unreliable.
It is a good quality laptop  I didn't receive the laptop that was advertised. It said it had a fingerprint reader for security, it does not. It is a good quality laptop, better for high school or college, but would not recommend for work. I needed a secured system and this is not what I expected.
Horrible computer  This laptop is so slow and unreliable. It is frozen more than it is operable. It kicks off of websites very easily and takes forever to restart. It is temperamental and difficult to navigate from one operation to another. No disk drive, and such an unreliable computer that I am not willing to invest any more money in its function. So disappointed after purchasing this computer, only relieved that I have a computer at work and an iPad, otherwise I would be buying another new laptop. The worst computer I have ever used. DO NOT BUY!!
Description stated windows 8.1 came with windows 10.
Bizarre Problems with Wifi Adapter  -  Poor Customer Service  I have had ongoing problems with the wifi adapter. It seems like the computer is turning the adapter off on its own. Began occurring when waking the computer from sleep mode, but now occurs entirely at random. Customer service initially tried to give instructions appropriate for a Windows 7 operating system, while this computer came from the manufacturer with Windows 8 installed. When I pointed out the mistake, the customer "service" representative was rude and defensive. I will not buy another Acer product.
Keyboard has a very strange layout.  UK version i think.  Shift key is in a weird cluster of odd punctuation marks and only about half the size it should be.  Meaning, you miss it every time.
Really frustrating to use  My grandmother was bought on this netbook during the oh so wonderful black friday sale. I've been forced to use it as my computer was having some problems. Needless to say, this is one of the most frustrating devices I've ever had to use.  I know, it's supposed to be cheap and affordable. You get what you pay for. Even then, it's still a hassle to use, regardless of what it is. I've tried going on twitter numerous times; resulting in the browser crashing unexpectedly. Then there's the lack of Skype, foreign language support, and slow typing among other problems I've had with this device.  Don't be duped in by the low price. It's just not worth even a fraction of a dime. Avoid.
Had this computer for 7 months and it died.  Do not buy this computer it is a piece of junk.
loud noisy fan, gets hot easily, not durable  the fan on this laptop is always on. its loud and the laptop temp is always at 60 degrees celcius. even at start up. it gets hot and the cool-sense thing is nonsense, it does nothing. i didn't send it in to repair/service but hp's repair service takes about 9 business days. you have to mail it in. so  overall the laptop is probably 3 and half stars and hp's repair policy just sucks, so i lowered the rating some more. the laptop is not durable and feels weak and flimsy especially the hinges. they feel like they will come off.
Hello Amazon . My computer died after two months. this is under warranty. I am working on a ship. Tell me what do i have to do with this laptop???
it didn't work properly since the first day  This PC did not work ok since the first day. The trackpad looses its configuration every other day, I had to format it after 2 weeks of purchase it, and it goes off by it shelf once every 10 times i use it, it is not normal for a new computer. I wanted to give it a second chance but is inpossible to work or do something on it. The worst is that Amazon does not give me an option to return it or exchange. i hoppe with this comment they will contact me
Graphics Processor not as advertised  The seller advertises that the laptop has an AMD Radeon R4 graphics processor with up to 2Gb of dedicated memory. The unit I received had has a AMD Radeon R3 graphics processor with up to 512Mb of dedicated memory. A major difference and a major disappointment.
Specs are great, but it only takes one flaw to consistently let me down.  I got this to replace a similar computer with different problems (crappy WiFi connection that dropped constantly); why did I get another Asus? Because the specs look so good - if only the performance were, too.  The problems with this one are in some ways less annoying - using it is less frustrating because at least the WiFi stays connected. On the other hand, if I let it go to sleep, I cannot wake it up again. I save my work pretty often, but when the computer goes to sleep and I haven't saved in a bit, I inevitably lose all of my work because the only way to turn the computer on again is to hold down the power button until it completely shuts off. At that point I can turn it on again, sans all of my work.  Windows 10 still drives me up a wall, and while I don't blame Asus for that, it's still a complaint.  That said, there are some positives:  The computer is incredibly light. I love that.  The keyboard works well for me; the track pad isn't great, but it usually gets the job done without causing any problems (left/right clicking sometimes throws me if my fingers stray and tapping the pad to left-click isn't always great; sometimes it does it when I don't want to, and other times it doesn't at all when I'm trying to - go figure)  Start-up after shutting down is quick - only a few seconds (aside from the weight, that's one of the key reasons I bought another Asus in spite of the issues I had with the last one).  It's powerful enough to run a LOT of programs at once - I've had two different browsers open with at least forty tabs open, ~30 photos being edited in Photoshop (not the free version), 10+ PPTX decks, and ~15 XLSXs (not small ones, either). I didn't notice any performance slowdowns with all of that running.
The computer doesnt go on at all, but I bought over a month ago as a gift. When the person received it, it did not work.
Refurbished computers not reliable  Very difficult time getting this computer going correctly.  It has some deep driver conflicts. tried changing to win 10; still working on it.  Gave up; returned computer.  Bought another T420 from same refurbisher: it also did not work: this time it is missing or corrupt files.  they are nice about it and will replace it, but I would like to get a computer in less time than a month or so.
Turtle is fast for this  Super slow. Don't buy it
it stopped working no response from seller  it stopped working  no response from seller
Be careful - motherboard blew in 6 months  This computer sat in a box for 6 months and then was a gift for a friend. Mother board blew up and now it it out of warranty. Total POS. Company should replace this since it only ran for 6 - 7 months before the mother board went.
It runs okay. Often the touch screen doesn't work and requires you to restart for it to finally start working. Also as a student it is extremely diffucult to have this laptop due to the fact that it doesn't run the programs I need it to have. Not only that but it doesn't connect to a printer so I always have to send my work to someone else to print or use a flashdrive and connect to another computer to print which is highly inconvient.
Terrible design choice in otherwise decent computer  Whether you like this computer probably depends upon why you use it.  I do a lot of photo processing and word processing.  The new touch pad is a deal killer.  Since they got rid of the right and left click buttons and combined them with the touch pad, it's very clunky and difficult to control when you click or when you don't.  If you just watch videos, maybe it's ok, but then you probably would want an iPad and not a full laptop.  Terrible.
Do not buy a computer with Windows 10 yet.  The Windows 10 is unreliable and should not be sold on a computer yet. That downgrade based on online instructions did not work for this unit and I had to pay Microsoft $49 to wipe the HD cleaner and give me a fresh install of Win 8.1. It still has driver ! Issues but seems to work now.
Surprised to be SO DISAPPOINTED!!!!!  After nearly 4 years of great experiences with Amazon the streak has come to an end.  Not sure about you but when I purchase something that is in "like new" condition I expect to only find small blemishes and scratches...NOT A HUGE DENT THAT SPANS THE ENTIRE WIDTH OF THE SIDE OF THE COMPUTER AND SO DEEP THAT IT DEEPLY DEFORMS BOTH THE UNDERSIDE OF THE BOTTOM AND THE UPSIDE OF THE TOP OF THE KEYBOARD SECTION OF THE LAPTOP.  I hope to write a follow up review of how well the return process went...and the wonderful customer service I am going to receive :0)  Of course, in the mean time my credit limit is still locked up until they process the review...so I can't re-order one until they confirm the return...URGH!!!  Either way--- you'll hear about it!  I give credit and criticism where its due.  Hope this ends well...it sure hasn't begun that way.  Rob - Western Chicagoland Area and Amazon Prime Member since '07
Be ready to return  Operated less than 12 hours (about three hours of actual 'ON' time) before hard drive would no longer pass self test and allow computer to boot.  DELL wanted me to remove the hard drive and send it to them for 7 to 10 day turnaround, Amazon stepped up. Replacement out for delivery 3 July. At least DELL was effective at helping diagnose the problem.
Returned and exchanged for 4 times! Amazon lies to its customer!  I must have been the most unfortunate customer buying Lenovo Laptop. I have ended up returning and exchanged 4 times. The first one I received, the touch-pad did not work with multi-fingers. The second one, I only used it for 5 days and the fan started making some weird grinding noise. The third one, the touch-pad was excessively loosened. It seemed like out of the place and produced loud noise when tapping it, even with just a light touch. The 4th one came to me with the same loosened touchpad like the 3rd one. Both the 3rd one and the 4th were manufactured exactly on the same day, month and year. OMG!  I would expect a much better quality from a $1,000+ laptop. But this is not the product that I want to use in the long term. I would not recommend it at all. I should have spent couple hundreds more to get an Asus ROG or MSI instead of Lenovo. The laptop seems more like a joke to me.  Amazon Customer Services also lies to customer horribly. There was one agent (I would like to hide the name) told me that if I would like to keep the loosened-touchpad laptop, he would give me 20% discount. Well, then by the time I called Amazon Customer Services and told a representative on the line that I would want to keep the laptop and request that 20% discount, she said that it is violating Amazon policy and that she could not do that! I cannot believe that two agents from the same company tell different stories to their customer like this. I have been shopping on Amazon for many years and I cannot believe this is happening to me. If you folks were me, what would you think? I am speechless!  Here is the exact copy from the 20% discount promise from Amazon customer services that I mentioned above.  "Hello,  I'm sorry to hear about the problem you had with your "Lenovo Y50 15.6-Inch Touchscreen Gaming Laptop".  However, I want to make this right for you so I'd like to offer you two options:  1. If you're interested in keeping the item, I'd like to offer you a refund of 20% off the price.  2. We will replace the entire set at no additional charge. You will need to return the item back.  I hope one of these solutions is satisfactory. Please write back and let us know which option you would prefer to choose. We will take care of it for you.  Please visit the following link to provide the information we requested:  http://www.amazon.com/rsvp-mi?c=bccyvuqt3694810428&q=o2r  One of our aims at Amazon.com is to provide a convenient and efficient service; in this case, we haven't met that standard. I'm truly sorry, and I hope you'll give us another chance in the future.  We look forward to hearing from you soon.  Best regards,  [Agent's Name]"  Of course, to be fair, this Laptop is very light weighted and has good performance in terms of CPU and GPU. But if folks ask me, I definitely say that please stay away from Lenovo and/or buying laptop from Amazon. You might end up just like me. Extremely frustrated!  May God bless you all!
Worked great for 30 minutes  At first we really loved this laptop. Compact. High-Quality body. Pretty screen. Nice keyboard. --- All that is great until the computer starts failing. First the wifi adapter would no longer be detected...I did update the driver once it finally started working again but immediately started getting errors from Windows regarding unsupported hardware. I then diagnosed and attempted to fix the computer but had no luck. Proceeded to start the windows recovery and then the SSD no longer showed as active. At this point I decided it wasn't worth the headache and felt that I shouldn't have to troubleshoot a laptop I just bought for over $1500.  Luckily I bought it from Costco and will be returning it immediately. Costco ftw.  Will just get another Mac and bootcamp Windows.
Dissapointed about this Toshiba P-50 Laptop  battery is very bad, it doesn't work for more than 30 minutes without charging. 12 GB RAM is not reliable . I could not find Arabic keypad with illumination. hangs sometimes and you will require to shut it down by long press on power button  It doesn't worth the money paid for it . never purchase such brand again .
Happy except for the battery  I am very happy with this laptop overall, but I am disappointed with the battery. I followed the instructions to maximize the battery life written by another reviewer, but I still only get about an hour.  Here are the windows experience results that I got:  Base score: 5.9  Processor: 6.1 Memory (RAM): 7.2 Graphics: 6.4 Gaming graphics: 6.4 Primary hard disk: 5.9  I ran Cinebench 11.5, and both the CPU and OpenGL came in 6th.  CPU: 2.71 pts OpenGL: 16.57 fps  The only other thing I found pretty annoying was the loud high pitched noise it had when you pressed the volume buttons on the case. To disable the sound, launch HWSetup.exe (C:\Program Files\TOSHIBA\Utilities\HWSetup.exe), click on the "Button Setting" tab and change "Function Button Sound Notification" to "Disabled".  EDIT 12/1/11: The machine started randomly turning off after a few months and now does it every 20min or so... I thought it might be overheating but now I'm not sure.
After installing Visual Studio, it keep restarting and cannot work anymore. Gosh, it's Visual Studio not a game. There must be something wrong with the Windows.
ACER laptop  Performed fine for about a month then crashed and had to be sent back.  Acer claimed that it reloaded the operating system and sent it back under warranty.  Of course, I paid the shipping to ACER.  The laptop now gives us BSOD sporadically and Outlook and Explorer often freeze.  I've run AVG Tuneup to fix registry and other errors but still have problems. I won't buy another ACER.
... symbol it definitely limits its portability which is quite annoying.  I expected it to work without the charging cord but it doesn't even have a battery symbol it definitely limits its portability which is quite annoying.
Maybe I jsut got a Lemon.  I bought this for my Son for Christmas. After 2 weeks it wouldn't power up.
bad garanty  Buy my computer 6 months ago, I have had problems with the hard disk, take her to radio shack 1 month ago and still they do not give me response, alone that the piece has not come.  Buy 2 computers in December of the past year and both have had the same problem and the same response of the guarantor, I never recommend to buy a Acer computer.
One of my worst computers.  I bought this computer so I would have a smaller one for traveling.  The keyboard is much smaller than a regular keyboard (which is expected) but is so small that I'm always hitting the wrong keys.  Also I've have many problems with the touch screen feature and the computer switching screens while I'm in the middle of typing.  (That gets very annoying when you're typing a work doc and a Netflix movie just starts playing.)  I've owned other HP computers before and never had a problem with them as I do this on.  Maybe I just got a lemon..
It's going back  Even if I lose money, I'm sending it back.  Why?  Because no matter how nice it looks, no matter how good the specs, it is too filled with problems.  Not huge, BSOD problems, but the nagging, time-consuming kind that destroy any pretense of workflow and create endless detours and distractions. To name a couple (and really, in some cases a couple is all it takes): 1. The right- and left-click portions of the trackpad don't just click, they also track.  So you have to use extra care when clicking, because the slightest pressure to either side will cause the cursor to drift.  So if you're trying to click a given function or link or whatever, you will open something else because the cursor drifted onto it. 2. Cursor is very jumpy and touchy in general.  I've gone through all the adjustments I can think of, and nothing helps. 3. Won't accept Win7 if you want to escape Win10.  Some of the Win7 drivers don't exist for this computer. 4. The worst is that the computer periodically freezes.  The fix is to power off and then back on (you don't have to hit the power button again, just tap the space bar a couple of times).  If it does this when new, I've seen all I need to see of this computer. It's too bad.  This computer looks nice, feels nice and probably works nice (except for the trackpad click issue and the cursor).  But I am not about to own something that is a constant minor irritation and keeps you locked into something you don't want (Win10), is a constant minor irritation (L/R click; cursor) and isn't reliable.
good average computer  good average computer' after you set it up for your use and a littile bit of downloads, its start to slow down and if you call customer support they are the worst I've ever experiance ,rude customer support and they don't  guide you threw a lot of manual downloads. you have to keep it updated, sorry to say but this sucks no one should have to search for multiple downloads manually so ive return mines
Read Before You Buy It. Do a Reseach On it....  This chrome book sooo fast, I will give it A+ in speed.... But It will be perfect if you can actually find programs that are compatible with chrome system. Cant download Office and cant instal my printer. The Office app its okay if you have internet conection all the time, Same as Google Drive.
The seller happily refunded and sent me another one  This is the second one I ordered in two weeks.  The first would not even boot up.  The seller happily refunded and sent me another one.  This one has been stuck for days on "checking for updates"?  I have always had Lenovo ThinkPads and love them.  This one is a lemon. I called Lenovo and they did say they now have the 460 and this 450 is last year's model.  But it is still new out of the box.  It will not find or install any Windows updates.  I am going to order the T460 through Lenovo now and hope for the best.  Don't buy this model.  Seller was great.
READ WELL  THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE LAPTOP ALL IN ONE  I am very sorry and unfortunate, lost with the purchase of this product, I thought it was a complete laptop, HHD, CPU, all in one, and what I have is a empty structure
No good warm up too ,give difficilty to retrive document.
NOT Durable or Rugged  This thing is supposed to be rugged but the keys easily fall off and don't reattach. We bought one and I thought maybe it was just my kids, but we bought another and on day 1 buttons came off the second one without any rough treatment. Very disappointed.
It didn't work from the first day, so I had to send it to the workshop to repair.
Asus HORRIBLE  HORRIBLE  Horrible, horrible, horrible.  It is not a backlit keyboard, wifi adapter stopped working, keys are hard to press.  I am going to return it.
No lo recomiendo  Le pedi una laptop nueva y me envio una usada y diferente a la comprada, no lo recomiendo para nada, deberia reembolsar la diferencia entre la nueva y la usada.
Bad Buy for me  This Certified Refurbished piece of Dell is rubbish. Faulty pretty much on all aspects. I don't doubt some of these actually work, mine don't.
Defect unit  Was able to use it only for one day. Screen didn't turn on the next day after I started using. Acer service told me it had a defect screen and suggested me to replace the product. Returning it, and will get another brand chromebook. Don't recommend.
Molasses Machine  If you're desperate for something cheap that won't catch fire, look no further! I bought this laptop specifically to be my spare for writing, as my primary laptop is intended for gaming. Even for that purpose, it is appallingly slow. Every click leads to an agonizing in Word. Browsing the web and streaming is a true test of patience. The sluggish load time can range up to a minute if it -doesn't- freeze just switching between tabs. I have stellar patience with computers owing to seven years relying on a refurbished 1998 Compaq Presario. This Lenovo really outshines that old beast in its stunning slothfulness, which is a shame because Lenovo is not a brand I generally sneer at.  Just know that it is an economical price for very good reason.
Deceiving  It was slow, it crashed a bunch of times and it has trouble staying connected to the internet
LIKE A NEW CAR WITH NO STEERING WHEEL  The laptop is really nice, but it wouldn't connect with my WIFI. My Apple products and work PC laptop connect with no issues. I shouldn't have to be an IT guru to get it to connect. This is 2014, it should connect automatically right out of the box. This is being returned immediately.
I did my research on chromebooks before I bought this. I thought I would be fine but I am finding myself with the short end of the stick more often than I would like.
Nice feature, less-than-mediocre execution  Bought tablet to replace laptop and physical notebooks at work.  Don't know if it's Windows 8 or Sony, but to get full use out of apps, PDF documents, Google maps, etc. you have to use the stylus vs. just using your fingers. There are phantom clicks on the screen which will switch windows, minimize and even close apps, browser windows, and folders.  Screen will randomly not accept touch commands either from the finger or stylus.  Orientation was stuck in portrait until I changed the settings in Control Panel.  Just a subpar product overall.  The inherent kickstand feature is nice, the magnetic keyboard is efficient, and the size of the screen is large.  Will be going back to a laptop ASAP.
Terrible!!  Screen went out in 2weeks!!
Netbook 2.0  This item looks nice and performs ok...as long as you are doing what Google wants you to do.  If you are used to working with a Windows platform and have all of your documents in Office, you will have to convert those files to ones compatible with Google docs.  There is no CD-ROM.  Basically, this is a Google Netbook.  It boots in less than 10 seconds because there is nothing on it.  The screen was so small that I had trouble seeing it and I have 20/10 vision.  This machine is great if all you want to do is casually look at web pages, but if you need it for anything productive, I just can't recommend it.  It stayed in my house for less that 12 hours before it was boxed back up and returned to Amazon; which was another nightmare within itself.
Do NOT buy this laptop!!!  I never write reviews but thought I should worn people about this model. There is a flaw with the design, the WiFi does not work unless you are very close to your router. Near the router I would get 20mbps in the next room I would get .2mbps. My old laptop would get 15mbps in that's same spot!!! I had Dell come to the house and replace my screen (antenna is in the screen) and 2 wireless cards. Also I had Amazon send me a new one but same problems. Google xps 15 wifi problems and yoy will see what i am talking about. Dell asked me to send them the computer for repair but I feel if I buy a new computer I should not have a referbished one. I am sending the 2nd one back and ordered a Levovo Y510p. I hope this helped people.  However if you are going to use ethernet only and not the wireless card you would be OK..
Poor Quality  Acer products are very attractive but do not hold up under normal use.  I have purchased one.  I began to experience problems with the unit just after the warranty period ended.  I cannot recommend the product.
Terrible Performance  HI y'all I've bought this netbook in order to substitute my small(8.9) screen Acer Aspire One, that had 1 giga Ram and atom n270 (that buy the way was a great computer). Unfortunatelly when I bought this one I have impressed by hard drive size and RAM availability (2gb) and screen size (11.6''), and them I committed the worst mistake of my computer/Laptop/etbook life I didn't check the processor performance. Accordling with INTEL this processor should be for mobile devices not for a notbook like device. Windows system performance is 1.9 the lowest I saw with Vista devices. And by the way the netbook shouldn't come with vista, maybe a XP Home edition, could change my perception. Don't buy it, if don't plain to change the OS. Regards PO
Not even a good toy!!  The average computer user will not get this item to work -- after a mystery tour of the interent (which warned against buying the product) a software upgrade was found that allowed the unit to hook up to a local wireless signal. But even at the lowest possible level graphics, page loading took "minutes" each page -- useless is my evaluation.
SHORT LIFESPAN!!!  Terrible computer.  Errors constantly, lame keyboard light doesn't shut and stays on all the time, now my Sound doesn't work anymore.  Only had for 2 months.
Buyer Beware  I am giving the Chrome book 1 star.  I purchased the Chromebooks because i needed a back-up to my 10yo Dell desk top.  I have no complaints about my dell as i have had it for more than 10yrs and have gotten more than my money's worth out of it.  It went on the fritz last weekend so i decided that i needed a back-up PC.  Just something that would allow me internet access to check my email and such.  The Chromebook fits that need since it has limited functions since it operates different than a normal PC....ie...you are unable to print or read word documents.  What really made me purchase this HP model is it came with free T-moble.  That is the reason i am rating it 1 star.  it indicates that you get free T-mobile for life.  that is all just a racket between HP & T-moble cause you only get 200MB for 30 days.  I received this on 6/18/14, and I was on the internet for about 1hr,watched 1 video wich was about 8mins long and then i got a msg from T-moble advising I had used up my 200MB and would need to purchase more data.  I will make a one time purchase but I will shop around for a unlimited 3G or 4G data plan.....I will not make any more purchases from T-moble just as a matter of principle for trying to rip people off!!!...To tell the truth i did not realize that this model did not come with an ethernet port or i would not have made the purchase.  Once you order the item from amazon and open the box you are unable to return it.  Update 6/26/14  I returned this chromebook for a full refund and thankfully Amazon honored my return ang refunded all my money, including shipping.  i had it for about 5 days...the 200MG that comes with T-mobile is a total rip off....i got a msg flash on my screen that i was out of data with 2hrs of creating an account.  I then purchased 1G for $10 for 30days.  less tha 24hrs later a msg flashed across my screen that advised i was out of data...this time i was unable to the $10 offer for 30days.  the only purchase i cld make was 1g for 7 days at a cost of$15.  I did watch some videos but i watch only about 4 n they were all under 10 mins.  I made the $15 purchse....after this purchase the bottom fell out....My chromebook began to wrk super slow n I each time i attemted to watch a videp....all it wld do was buffer.  i call t_mobile on a sunday at 8pm...I spoke to 7 different ppl in tech support and none of them cld help me....I was on the with the last tech i spoke with for about 30mins....finally she advised she had tried all she cld and gave me 2 ph#s to HP....I contacted amazon that nite for a refund. once the $15 charge i made to t-mobile for 1g of date hit my cc i called the disputes dept to reverse the charge...once i explaind the issue to the CC CSR, she placed me on hold for about 3 mins.  when she came back she advised a $15 credit wld be refunded to my car....I will parchase another Chromebook but i will also purchase a USB adapter that will allow me to connect via an ethernet.
Quite easily the worst piece of technology I've ever used  Quite easily the worst piece of technology I've ever used. Thankfully it was forced on me by my company and I didn't waste money on it. HDMI port doesn't work right. Graphics are unstable. Ctrl Key is in the WRONG place. Just bad. Avoid this piece of garbage at all costs. just buy a Dell. I had my last Dell for 3 years and never had a single complaint. In 2 months of owning this horror show I've wasted hours diagnosing the next problem it throws up. Absolute garbage.
Bad can't shutdown, Weird buzz sound, hangs everytime, keys don't respond as expected  I bought my Acer Aspire 2 months ago and it worked ok few days later stared problems with keys, every now and then happens to freez, later a buzz sound started hearing from near batter even in sleep mode. Trying to get rid of this piece of crap. Only it looks good but performs really really bad.
DON'T BUY, NOT WORTH THE MONEY  Bought this January 5th, in March the mouse pad broke, there is no return after 30 days and since they do not put the serial number on the invoice, you cannot return it to ASUS.  this is the second computer like this I bought, the first one the mother board went bad at 10 months old, you think I would have learned.
Limited use  Everything operates on Google apps.. not easy to find the programs I need to use.  Difficult to store web favorites, no printing app available  and the Skype app does not support video or phone calls.  it is okay for gaming and checking one's mail. After Windowss the Chrome experience has a high learning curve.
I would say don't go for this product. Hangs all the time, takes almost 10-15 minutes to start. not worth the money
WARNING Dell will refuse your warranty. DO NOT BUY. DO NOT waste your HARD earned money  Dell/Alienware refused my warranty service after my laptop broke because it's garbage quality.  Called many times and got the run around. Tech came and brought wrong parts. Afterwards never replied and my service was listed as COMPLETED even though NOTHING was done.  Tech sent was incompetent and needed my assistance to open the system. How pathetic is that ? Person sent look like some random wal-mart shelf stocker. Absolutely no idea what she was doing...  **CAUTION** YOU WILL HAVE MAJOR HEADACHE calling in for warranty service. Just google your own research. I am not the only one who has terrible quality and refused warranty service.
0 for 2  Waste of money.  I'm on my second ASUS C300SA Chromebook in a month, and the only reason I'm still using it is because it's the provided technology for a summer workshop that I am in.  The first Chromebook worked well for 2 hours and then the touchpad quit working (tried everything, including a reset to factory settings, with no luck).  Amazon provided a second Chromebook, and this one has worked for about 3 weeks.  Now it restarts randomly (nearly every 10 minutes), and I've tried everything suggested online to fix it (logging in as a guest, a hard reset, reset to factory settings) with no luck.  The only thing that keeps it from restarting is to keep the power cord plugged in (which defeats the primary purpose of a Chromebook).  The battery shows a full charge, but if I unplug the power cord, the Chromebook goes back to randomly resetting itself.  0 for 2 ASUS.... the first issue was the touchpad... and I'm pretty sure the issue now is the battery.  Those are both ASUS issues... not Chrome issues.
Would be great except for wireless connection issues  Honestly a great laptop with one deal breaking problem with the wireless connection.  For some reason the connection never gets more than 2 bars and sometimes won't even pick up even though I'm not far away from my router at all.  All my other laptops connect 4 to 5 bars.  This I can't even use this laptop upstairs in the home and it's worthless if I take it outside the home.  A big shame since in all other aspects, it's would be a solid laptop for the price.
I only had this a few days when it froze up and would not unfreeze.  I returned it.
IT IS A LEMON  I TRIED TO WORK WITH IT BUT IT HAS FROZEN ON ME OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WHEN I TRIED TO RETURN IT, I FOUND OUT THAT I'D MISSED THE DEADLINE (NOV 2ND) BY A WEEK. IT WILL NOT LET ME PUT IN MY PASSWORD BEYOND THE FIRST CHARACTER. NOW I'M HAVI8NG TROUBLE WITH THE INSURANCE  THAT I TOOK OUT. ALL IN ALL $600 WORTH OF CRAP. I HOPE NOBODY ELSE HAS THIS PROBLEM. CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ASUS ALSO VERY FLIPPANT AND UNHELPFUL.  GHASTLY EXPERIENCE ALL WAYS ROUND
THE WORST EXPERINCE OF MY LIFE  IT'S BEEN THE BIGGEST NIGHTMARE A HUMAN COULD POSSIBLY ENDURE...HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS, A DISAPPOINTED KID AT CHRISTMAS...PURCHASED DEC 9TH, NOT WORKING AT CHRISTMAS STILL STILL STILL DON'T HAVE IT WORKING...AWFUL, TERRIBLE
Had to have repaired 2x in less than 1 year.  Avoid.  Computer is currently in the hands of Lenovo repair center for the 2nd time in the 9 months I've owned it.  They've had it for 2 weeks on a 'part hold'.  Lots of quirks when not fully bricked, like it has 2 times now.  avoid.
Continuously crashes when trying to load basic games and super loud.  Returned within 1 hour of operating this junk. Continuously crashes when trying to load basic games and super loud.
Product is invisible  I have yet to received this product, I have written to both amazon and the company and have yet to received this product.  It was a christmas gift for my granddaughter and she has been out of a gift because of this order.  My next step is to report this incident to the better business bureau to see if I can either get my product or my money. They have left me no choice.
fast computer, horrible touchpad  if you want to use this laptop at a variety of locations, don't buy it. the touch pad is horrible. and its unfortunate because for something so simple, it makes such a huge difference and really effects this computer. it is very powerful but without using an external mouse (which can be obnoxious if you move your computer around at all), its not very enjoyable to use.
Upgraded to windows 8.1 from installed windows 8 and it crashed. Blue screen of death. I called Samsung and they offered no help. Couldn't go into bios mode couldn't get any help.
Multiple issues out-of-the-box and poor support from lenovo  Issues with wireless, issues with operating system (built-in apps not functioning). Lenovo support wanted to charge me to help me solve their software issues on a brand new computer that didn't work out of the box - outrageous! Microsoft support solved those for me (they were friendly, helpful and effective)...I called them after Lenovo tried to charge me for fixing a flawed new product. Lenovo was unable to fix the adapter issue also so now I have to re-format the computer (after setting everything up), send it in to their support, wait and hope they can resolve it...  It's a lot of hardware for the price - but definitely not worth the head-aches.
Not what we thought
Returned it. Kept receiving the same error message over and over.. Pay this much for a laptop and shouldn't have this many problems.  I have buddies who love theirs, but I think I just got a lemon..  Love my new mac though
It crashed on me and sent it back for a refund
What a piese if crap!! Do not buy  Stopped working after 2 months!! What a piece if crap!!  Do not buy!!!
NEVER BUY THIS COMPUTER cant get battery out, HP  no use and i cant return it. Will NOT CHARGE. says plugged in not charging. Got run around from HP. Now i own a $700 PAPERWEIGHT. LUCKY ME!
Motherboard fried 3 weeks out of warranty. Do not buy!  Purchased September 29, 2016 for $999. Within the first few weeks the touchpad malfunctioned and neither I, a repair shop, or Asus support were able to get it working normally again.  I used this laptop primarily as a desktop replacement -- I'm not a gamer and use it for school and work purposes. Clean, never dropped, never got wet, etc. Treated with the utmost care!  However, the motherboard fried on November 19, 2017, barely three weeks out of warranty.  Quoted $640 + shipping both ways by Asus for repair. That's a load of BS if you ask me.  This seems to be a common complaint for this laptop and the timing is suspiciously consistent -- nearly all cases I've come across are the same as mine: fried just out of warranty. I would not recommend this machine or brand to anybody.
No one is good for their word  This POT turned into one of my biggest nightmares. It never worked properly. One issue after another. After innumerable Geek Squad repairs, home and remote, decided to ship it to Dell for repairs that I will have to pay for and give it to my grandson. All you get when you call Dell is the Phillipines. I ask you, in this day and age who wants their computer in the hands of another country?  With Amazons POT return policy Im out my $$$ and precious time. No one is willing to believe me and do the right thing. No one is good for their word. Done buying online. Supplier was Pens. #HateDell #HateAmazon
Consider options with better support  I purchased a similar laptop to this one, a Lenovo 560p, approximately two years ago. The laptop will no longer accept a charge, and many other users face a similar issue. Despite this, Lenovo wants to charge me to repair the laptop instead of recalling the product. Given that the design is similar, a significant number of 510p buyers can expect to have the same issue with no recourse. Otherwise the laptop has been great.
Wasted  I didn't have an activation code, and when I went to type half the keys didn't work.
Tired and well used PC  It is a tired, well used PC. The hard drive started making noise after 1 year. Then quit all together. Not worth the money.
Keyboard was defective
Just Terrible  Just terrible.  I use Dell Latitude laptops for work and they are great.  We got this Inspiron for my son to start college to replace a five year old Inspiron laptop.  Some of the problems with this laptop were.  - Space bar did not work unless you hit it right in the middle. - Sometime the spacebar did not work at all. - Seemed to be made of very cheap feeling and looking plastic. - Very long reach to the keys.  Could not get comfortable with the reach.  We sent this one back for a full refund.  Very easy to send back.
The Screen Did Not Work!  The screen did not work at all. The power would come on, I could hear the hard drive spinning, but could not get anything to appear onscreen. I tried everything and I could not even boot into the boot menu/BIOS/UEFI. The user's manual is completely worthless - it literally only tells you how to plug in the computer and press the power button. Before buying this computer I had read multiple reviews on here saying their screens were going out either right out of the box or after a couple months of use. I stubbornly made the purchase because the specs on this computer are so great for the price, and now wish I hadn't. Luckily, Amazon customer service is very easy to deal with and gave me a full refund. I'm actually glad this problem happened out of the box and not two or three months down the road when it is too late to return it.  I realize manufacturing defects happen, but a problem like this out of the box is ridiculous. To make it worse, the Asus customer service experience is absolutely horrible. They have a rep that comes on here and puts responses to negative reviews, but it is all just basically the same message that is copied and pasted onto any review. The Asus website is terrible, it is hard to navigate, and their FAQ/help page has absolutely nothing worthwhile. There is no phone number listed even though the box had a sticker describing "24/7 phone support". Nope. The only way of contacting someone to get help is to send an email, which took 48 hours to get a response from. When I got the response, it was just another generic copied and pasted message with a link to some form they wanted me to fill out and send in so I can once again explain my situation and then sit around waiting for help. No thanks - I returned it to Amazon and purchased a different computer brand. Asus is based in Taiwan and obviously all of their "support" is based there as well, and their website has lots of basic English grammatical errors. I realize mistakes happen in production but I will now be avoiding all Asus products in the future due to their horrible customer service and support experience.
TERRIBLE!  No parts are easily available for this computer! Vizio stopped making this because they are terrible!! DO NOT BUY ! DO NOT BUY!!  The computer itself is sleek and functional,for the most part. I do have issues watching videos (I have super fast internet and that's not the issue, it's the computer) and running multiple programs.  Also have experienced multiple problems with the wireless connectivity (again, reliable internet and another computer operating without issue at same time) that would just disappear for no reason. It would take 20 minutes or so of shutting down and rebooting computer. SUPER STRESSFUL when trying to run a business from your laptop.  The keyboard and touch pad could use a major re-design. They are not functional for everyday use and the keyboard sticks and the buttons are hard to push down after a month use. Everything else is fine but I would highly recommend another computer if you plan to use the keyboard and touch pad on a regular basis.  It looks cool, that's about it and you are overpaying for that reason alone.
Terrible, don't buy it!  Don't buy this item.  This is the SLLLLLOOOOWWWEEESSST computer on the face of the earth.  I was very unsatisfied with it's processing speed.  I beefed up the RAM and it helped, but very little.  It is CRAZY slow.  It can take over a minute just to open up programs.  I don't recommend unless you have patience and just simply don't care.  As for pluses, it's size is handy.  It has great screen for viewing movies.  I called the 1-800 number to talk to tech about trying to get the computer running faster.  Here's what he said "you get what you paid for."  My mouth dropped wide open.  What an idiot.
It doesn't come with the SSD of 8 GB. The place for the SSD was empty. I'm from Uruguay and I couldn't ask for it. Because just the cost of the career is very expencive.
not a very strong and reliable laptop  I've used this laptop for a little over a year now... first of all, when I newly got it, as soon as I powered it on, I noticed a rather very audible disturbing noise coming from it unlike other laptops i've used. Then after a year of using it, it suddenly started malfunctioning. I can't use the laptop at all, it keeps hanging and I can't click on any icon at all, nothing would just respond, I can't even turn it off properly. I had a sony Vaio before using this, I got this because it's a lot smaller than my sony Vaio and more portable, i've had my sony Vaio for over 4years and I never had any issues with it, it never malfunctioned, even the battery life was still at it's best. I was hoping for a similar experience with this product if not better but this was a huge disappointment, and it went bad just at the very worse possible time, I have academic works in progress and a lot at stake and i've missed a lot, this is affecting my speed. Wish I never went for this product. Wish I went for a stronger well known name, I won't be encountering this problem now. Just a little over a year with this product and it's giving me a heck an issue. Affordable price but not strong and reliable.
Horrible experince  I bought the Acer Aspire S7 for my daugther - so she could show the Apple fanboys (that is all the other pupils) how awesome Microsoft was  - and also touch. Acer was the coolest looking thing on the street. But... the fan noice is horrible - it is so loud that it almost makes it impossible to work with this thing. So dissapointed.
Terrible quality.  First it gives only one year warranty while it gives three years in China, and problem starts from the second year I purchased it. AC port failed first, then the USB 3.0 port did not work following USB 2.0 ports. Now I just found that HDMI port also malfunctions with unstable connection.  I will not buy ASUS laptop again.
Total piece of crap. Hours to upgrade to Windows 10  Total piece of crap. Hours to upgrade to Windows 10. Do not touch with a 10 foot pole - taking me hours to restore. Last Amazon Computer order ever! Amazed that Amazon would even endorse this product. Having to remove the battery to shut down. Best Buy hays this model with Widows 10 installed for $800.
return in a week.  I cannot believe how often this thing freezes up! I could not get computer to come out of hibernation. I spent and hour and a half on the phone with HP. to me that you're paying for the looks and "style" of this laptop, and definitely not the performance.
Not again.  I am VERY disgusted. I have been a ThinkPad fan for better than 14 years.  When I worked for corporate America I would beg plead and bribe the guys in IT to get a ThinkPad as opposed to other laptops.  As an independent contractor I have purchased my last two ThinkPads out of pocket.  Something to note: this last machine, and the troubled machine, is a Lenovo ThinkPad, not an IBM ThinkPad. With the problems I have had with this new laptop, my ThinkPad/Lenovo days are over. I'm DONE.  Out of the box I have had graphics problems. The laptop is still under warranty.  Over several months, and hours on the phone, the hardware and software phone reps (and requested supervisors) with Lenovo pitched me back-and-forth like a hot potato, disclaiming their involvement..  My last conversation with them was with the software group, who insisted I PURCHASE a software warranty.  But wait a second  my computer is still under warranty.  Why am I having to come out of pocket to pay for a computer that is still under warranty?  I have four sets of software that do not work properly work with this ThinkPad.  Three of those four are big-name software  Microsoft Office 2013, Adobe Acrobat 11 pro, HP, and one other smaller software company.  The contacts in Outlook 2013 do not have scrollbars, therefore I cannot scroll down to the address to see or make changes.  In Acrobat 11 Pro I cannot scroll to the bottom of the screen in several options therefore not allowing me to click okay, cancel etc.  The HP software does not display some dialog boxes properly, likewise with the other software.  Get the picture? I have four separate software apps, with four separate problems, yet Lenovo wants to tell me that it is a software issue not a problem with their machine - hardware or software or drivers.  During this process I asked for local authorized repair facilities.  I got a list of 6, 4 of them do not do any repairs for Lenovo anymore, two of them could barely  and I mean barely speak English.  The most savvy contact that I had would not tell me why they were no longer a repair facility for the ThinkPad computer.  Hmmmm . . .  Since I was such a tenured and loyal fan of the ThinkPad, it took a lot of work to disenfranchise me.  Well, Lenovo did a GREAT job in doing that.
Shortest Life Span and Worst Support  I did not buy this machine from amazon but want to add my review for Dell anyway. I bought mine from Microsoft Store. I only used this machine when I work from home 1 day a week.  It is mostly used to control my machine at work via remote desktop.  After 1+ years minimal use, the machine will not turn on and it is out of warranty. I took it to Microsoft Store and they sent it to Dell (east cost) and was told that I will have to shoulder the bill to get it fixed if they can before they start doing so. Dell said they don't have and can't get the parts needed to fix it so they sent it back to Microsoft Store. I was advised that nothing can be done at that point and offered me the choice to pick it up or have them discard the laptop. What a piece of junk!!!
Don't waste your money and your time  I got mine and its showing a "replace now" on the battery status. totally not worth it. Don't waste your money and your time.
Spacing bar is tough to use  For a $300 pc, this is a good buy. My only complaint is the space bar has to really be pounded on to get it to work. Other than that, runs like expected.  Update:  Purchased on July 7, 2016.  November 16 The keyboard input just went out.  It's noW I discover that jfor any fix includfing battery removal, it is a MAJOR task to take apart.  Anyway back to the keyboard.. To get it to work I had to attach a wireless keyboard and mouser.  This makes in not easily transporterd.
A very risky purchase, laptops are not in good shape  Recieved my t420 from klamp electronics fulfilled by Amazon, it didn't take me more than 10 seconds after it booted for me to figure out there were multiple tiny black spots on the screen indicating dead pixels. On top of that, anytime I scrolled down a webpage or had any kind of video playing, a certain section of the screen would continually flicker. Those are major problems for me considering I paid 280 dollars for a "certified refurbished" laptop that wasn't supposed to have problems. I also noticed a few days after the price went back up to 320, which is a complete rip off considering I got the same t420 laptop at a local refurbishing company near me for 140 DOLLARS LESS (180$), for a laptop that looks amazing, has no signs of wear and tear and a beautiful screen, unlike the one I received from klamp electronics which was visibly heavily used, had multiple areas showing signs of wear, keys that were bent,  and an extremely defective screen. They offered to replace it after a few days of badgering them, but after I thought about it, I couldn't see why I would take another chance on a company that would send me this laptop in the first place. I ended up going on Craigslist and getting THE SAME LAPTOP, IN WAY  BETTER SHAPE FOR 140$ LESS. I realize some people have received very nice laptops from klamp but do keep in mind, YOU MIGHT NOT GET A GOOD ONE!!! terrible experience, terrible price, terrible product. Please click if you found this helpful
not worth it  Not happy with the laptop. I have emailed the seller twice and still no return. I don't believe this laptop is even worth half what I paid for it
Got a dud!  Bought this for work. Loaded the Toshiba DynaDock and personalized my settings. Everything was going great until I unplugged the USB cable from the DynaDock to the laptop. The laptop made a winding down noise and shut off...never to return to life again.  I never had bad luck with Toshiba until this one, so I'm not writing off the brand. But I guess luck runs out at some point. Returned for refund including the DynaDock. Nothing wrong with dock but no need for it if I'm not going to have a Toshiba laptop. I like to buy same brand peripherals to make sure they work seamlessly.
Computer runs slow because Dell keeps offering to do backups and what not. Also, I didn't realize that Microsoft would not be included. Not thrilled.
Had problems with the unit and sent it back.  Fast refund of funds.  Found a similar unit new for a little more.
DO NOT BUY REFURBISHED ACER  Do not buy refurbished Acer S7.  I have only had it six months, had it repaired once, and same thing happening again.  It only works three seconds on batter before screen goes blank. What am I supposed to do with portable computer I can't use portably?  Spent $900 on this computer, buy another one after only six months of use??? This is refurbished product and it came with warranty.  After two months of using the computer I found it to be crashing after two minutes on battery.  I sent it back and supposedly it was fixed.  Again after another two months of using the computer the same crashing took place.  Do not buy Acer refurbished product and I have no idea on whether an Acer-not refurbished would work well either.  Acer would not help with the product even after acknowledging that it had to be sent back to be fixed, and now still doesn't work as it is supposed to.  I paid $900 for this computer and have a lemon.
Never Again  I wanted to buy a reasonably priced laptop for my daughter but from the beginning we had nothing but issues. Slowness. Issues logging onto the internet. Trouble navigating through the screens. Pop ups! We spent hours with the Dell Support Team who although willing to help never got the computer up and running like we would have liked. We eventually had to return the laptop and although we went with a much more expensive laptop my daughter loves it. Never again!
Terrible. The screen was damaged.
Don't buy Refurbished  This computer never worked right.  It was very frustrating.
Worst keyboard in the history of input devcices  It is almost literally impossible to type.  I can either choose between backing off to 10 words a minute or 50% error rate when typing normally. My analogy is it is lke trying to walk on a frozen lake with sneakers on. No way Asus didn't know this but went for 'cool' looking keyboard instead. They should be ashamed.
SLOW!!!  So damn slow. This thing I want to shoot because it's so slow
Regretful  I wish I could give this computer 0 stars:  I bought the Samsung Series 5 14" because it was light, had a DVD drive, and enough USB and HDMI kits ... unfortunately I bought it online through Amazon before ever testing the computer at a store (my mistake):  1) The computer worked fine for less than a week before it took 15+ minutes to start up; I ran recover several times without any success. I gave it to the IT dept at work - they partitioned the drive and it worked for a week. The start up problem persisted again - I sent it back to the IT dept who held onto it for a month before telling me the hard drive was faulty. The IT dept apparently traced the hard drive to a faulty batch .. how? I have no idea, I'm not in IT.  I contacted Samsung and they were not very helpful (I was in China when it happened and they referred me to Samsung China warranty - like I can speak Chinese?!?!?!?!?) so I took matters into my own hands and bought a 1Tb replacement drive and had Futureshop replace it - it took them a while to find the drivers and some of the software is still missing.  2) The keyboard and touch-pad layout are not very good - the touch-pad keeps activating while I am typing.  3) I like the mat screen BUT the resolution is not very good and the viewing angle is a joke (you have to be directly in front of it for any decent colors, and it is really not that bright (300??? no way)  4) It keeps saying "not charging" while it is in fact charging  5) The preloaded Samsung apps are not user friendly (well after replacing the drive they are missing anyway!)  6) No backlit keyboard is a minus  7) The overall quality feels poor, the plastic is already discoloring with permanent marks from just opening and closing; the webcam is also a joke - my ipad and iphone have much better resolution which is sad.  8) Have not come even close to the battery life Samsung claims.  Pros: It is indeed light  Conclusion: I have had 4 Dell's previous to this "ultrabook" ... yes they had many issues but to be honest my old XPS1350??? circa 2009 is a faster and more reliable machine (even with its red-hot underside). My recommendation is to avoid this computer like the plague and find something else; put it this way, you get what you pay for - I should have spent an extra $100-200 on a real "ultrabook" that had an optical drive.
There is an very annoying error.  Pros: i5 chip, 8gb ram, 1TB hard drive. long battery (around 5 or 6 hours surfing internet), quiet fan. Cons: 1/ The display is kind of dim compared to other $500 laptops. I don't expect a high end display for a laptop like this, but I have to say that the display is bad. The brightness is dim, and the color is pale. 2/ The touch pad is kind of small for a 15 inch laptop. The build of the touch pad is also not good. You can see splits around the edge. 3/ It's bigger than other 15 inch laptops. I have compared this one to Dell Inspiron i3531-1200BK and it's bigger a lot. Actually, it's has the same size as my friend's 17 inch HP laptop. That means you have to be careful when shopping accessories like backpacks or sleeve. However, the 3 things above are not big deals for me. I can live with them. The following reason is the main reason that I won't suggest people to buy this laptop. IT DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY WITH MY EXTERNAL HARD DRIVES. I have 2 USB 3.0 external hard drives, and none of them working properly with any USB ports of this laptop. I have updated window 8.1, I have updated every Dell's latest drivers, I also turn off USB saving energy in Power options as well as in Device manager.  Nothing works, It just doesn't work. The external hard drives keep disconnecting and reconnecting after around half and hour. This is very annoying. It hurts my experience when I watching movies on my external hard drives or do any works on the external hard drives. My external hard drives work well with my old Dell window 7 laptop, so I'm sure that the error doesn't come from my external hard drives. I'm not sure where this error comes from, Dell's drivers or Window 8.1. So, if you have an external hard drive, I won't recommend you to buy this laptop. In fact, i won't recommend this laptop to anyone until I find a way to fix this error. The reason that I don't return this laptop is that I really need a laptop at this time for my project. I absolutely would find some technical support, after I finish my project. Overall, you should look for another laptop. Thanks for reading my review. P.s: If you guys used to have this kind of error, and found a way to fix it, please let me know. I would appreciate that, thanks.
It will not turn on .
Total garbage... 1 star for the color  This computer is garbage. It worked decently for the first few months but now I've had it for a year and it won't hold a charge. If I fully charge it and then unplug it and shut it down, it won't turn on again without being plugged in. The McAfee it came with expired and I can't go online to fix it be value I only get the privacy warning thing on chrome. I can't use the office suite because the version it came with expired and there's no internal memory so I can't download the version I get through school onto it. Not like I could get the website to work anyway... No wonder why it was discontinued.
Chrome book  DO NOT BUY!!! This is a horrible little laptop, & plus it breaks way to easily. The whole layout for the laptop it dumb.
This computer does not allow me to download new soft wear for the internet. I am not able to use half of the websites I need to use (which is why I bought the laptop)
Storage space too small for Windows - esp upgrading to Win 10, adding updates  We bought this laptop on 11/29/14 and have used it daily for the past 14 months for websurfing, email, watching videos online.  Out of the box, it had Win 8.1 installed & everything worked great. Wifi connected fine, comfortable keyboard, nice design; the best part is still the looks & color (which is sad, actually).  Within a few months, the Wifi started dropping a lot. We bought a USB wifi adapter and that helped, but the onboard Wifi really should be good enough quality to last.  The keyboard is a pain. It's just not as smooth as other ones. Not sure if it just gets old, but I've never noticed keyboard issues with any of the numerous other laptops we've had.  The computer is sluggish.  We run Avast, Malwarebytes, and Superantispyware regularly and disk cleanup, but it's just too slow.  The biggest issue is lack of storage space! This hard drive is just TOO small for a large operating system like Windows!  (fine with linux)  These streaming laptops should come with a minimum of 64gb hard drive space.  We don't use this to store files such as photos, videos etc. Just Windows, antivirus, and a few programs we use regularly.  We can't even load Office because there isn't enough space (after cleaning the disk via Windows and Clean Master). If you do a Google search, some people can't even update Windows or upgrade to Windows 10 because of the lack of space.  We are getting a micro SD card (it does have a micro SD slot) to keep in the slot all the time so we can transfer as much off of the SSD as we can eg if we can use the micro SD for antivirus, Office etc that may help.  Next time I buy a streaming laptop, I will look for a different brand (all our HPs have been problematic) and something with a bit more storage.  Edit:  Office 365 can NOT be stored on an SD card. Unlike previous versions of Office, there is no option where to install.  We added a 32gb micro SD card, moved our antivirus software & other programs onto that, and we were able to install Office 365. However, there is very little storage space left.
A LOT OF DAMAGE IN THE SHELL
Track pad becomes unresponsive and requires a restart.
Sound issue  When I connect this chromebook to a sound system through earphone jack I get noise constantly on and off. I called a Toshiba support center and a guy said this laptop is not compatible with external PC speakers !! Worst customer support. He even asked me what kind OS I'm using. If you want to listen to music through your sound system don't buy this chromebook !
You can get a MUCH BETTER custom-build from Dell for the price charged for this SLOW laptop.  Just began working with this brand new Dell Inspiron 17 laptop and it's extremely SLOW!!!  The only thing I've added to this system is a new version of Outlook 2010 - no pst files loaded yet and I haven't transferred any other files to it yet. Takes approximately 3 minutes to startup after a proper close-out and restart. Takes several seconds just to open Internet Explorer. Very,Very disappointed. I checked the Dell site tonight and could have bought a much better system for the same price straight from them. Amazon's return policy prohibits any returns shy of receiving a unit that does not work at all. I'd recommend anyone spend their money elsewhere for computer purchases.
Worked fine for 6 months  Worked fine for 6 months.  We went on vacation and the battery drained completely.  Now it won't charge or turn-on at all.  I'll try working with Acer, but suspect we'll just have to purchase new Chrombook.  This time, it won't be Acer
Do not buy!  I purchased this laptop (not through Amazon unfortunately) in March.  By May, it stopped working - the SSD was defective and had to be replaced (something which should not have happened on a computer 2 months old).  When the computer was returned to me from the Lenovo repair center, the Wifi had stopped working.  Back it went, only to find out that this time the defective part was not in stock.  As of the end of July, I still do not have the computer and have been without a working laptop for longer than I had a working one.  Lenovo claims they can't replace it.  Do not get this computer.
Windows 8.1=HEADACHE  I am not a computer savvy person and bought this computer because it was cheap and I needed it for some college classes I was taking.  If all you want to do is write papers and do some online research, it is going to get the job done.  Unfortunately, the operating system is Windows 8.1, which is apparently the source of all of my problems with this laptop.  I am pretty anti-Apple and just not willing to spend the outrageous amounts of money on their products so I ended up with this thing.  Next time I will buy a chrome book, or anything else without Windows 8.
Bummer.  Laptop died after 9 months of light daily use by its 68 year old owner. Seller refuses to look at it because the return period has passed. Buyer beware.
Didn't Work For Me  I was looking for too much, it turns out. I wanted a light, super-portable machine for travel that could handle Microsoft Office plus email and that could be plugged into a projector on occasion. This one seemed just right, but after ten minutes I found that I couldn't actually use the Office functions, aside from bringing up files. The machine just can't handle it. Word kept pausing to think every couple of key strokes, making it impossible to compose even a single sentence. Aside from that, the keyboard was too small for me to type on, and the touch screen was too wonky to do anything with. In the end, this is a perfectly fine tablet for a good price, but it simply can't be used like a laptop. I wonder why they even bother to try. Tablets are for watching Youtube videos; laptops are for work. Never the twain shall meet. I'm now in the market for an ultrabook.  On the positive side, I got to learn this valuable lesson first hand and had no trouble at all sending the product back for a full refund. UPS came and picked up the package the next day. Simple as that.
Do not buy.  Shame on Amazon.  Horrible notebook.  Windows 10 is too big to fit with installed hardware.  Bloated with adware and useless software.  HP support cannot fix it.
I hate it  I am reporting on the product as it came. 1. Hardware : 1.1 Pros : - sturdy frame. - this is thin. Although  the cross section is mostly constant compared to a macbook air. I figured the volume and shape factor may be more accurate in "how thin it feels", but this laptop is definitively thin and quite light for an aluminum frame. It will not disappoint you. - matte screen is very nice, no reflection, you can actually use it everywhere which is the point of having a portable unit. I had tried the ativ 9 book plus (NP940) with a qhd screen and I am glad I got this one instead, although I was hesitating. I use this computer for coding, internet and movies. I am glad I do not have to stare at a mirror, covered with fingerprints with tiny fonts and icons. - this is fast. it takes about 5 seconds to boot. The single channel ram does not seem to impede the overall performance for a regular use which confirms what I read about single vs. dual channel ram. 1.2 Cons: - I really like the aluminum side trims, but this model does not have it. Even though, it shows on the box: false advertisement there. It's not a reason to return it but it definitively took down some of my expectations on a product where aesthetics matters. - The charger keeps on unplugging. The connector has a small pin (2.5 mm) which is fine, but the interlocking is too weak: do not move when charging. Never had that feeling that you were charging and you actually don't?  2. Software: 2.1 Pros : Nothing particular. They're about to release a software called "Side Synch" which is great if you have a samsung smartphone.  2.2 Cons: -This product is filled up with shovelware to the point that it is a real shame. You get 63.4GB free out of 97.2GB (out of the box) Seriously!? I double up my free space each time I insert a 64 GB flash drive: it is that ridiculous. Samsung did not bother optimizing the install with respect to the SSD capacity. Even worse: some of these programs cannot be uninstalled just like viruses. So I had to install a new OS and get the drivers which are unavailable: no downloads on the support page. Windows 8 was unable to get the driver for the wireless card, then I ended with the thinnest-snappiest laptop on the market...and no wireless. Keep in mind that this computer cost about $1,200 tax included ($88). In the end I was able to get 100GB free out of 118GB and counting...so this was necessary. I also found a program which found my wireless driver. All was a long fight.  - Windows 8 is garbage. Do you want to install Skype? Before you would just download and install it. Now, you get the program...uh...not so fast, they called it an "app", so it is completely different (not). You have to go on the microsoft store where you only have microsoft certified "apps" and you hope that it is free (it's a store). Then you try to get the app but no, you need to create a microsoft account, like you need one more. You have a user account, an admin account and a store account, so it takes pulleys and ropes to run this machine. I feel like an accounting assistant...so screw this! So then you want to turn off your computer. Before you had the power or the windows start button. Now? I don't know. Some genius removed the start button and the power button put it to sleep, so I googled it. Here I am, googling how to turn off my computer, plugged to a LAN cable. It turned out that it is not simple! Bear with me: Zoom icon (if you can see one) -> Search -> Settings OR...sign out. You cannot turn off the computer if you don't sign out: it will not do it for you. You will not see the power button. They were afraid that you can get caught in a dimension where your computer is signed in and..turned off! Then I found that a good old alt+F4 on the desktop does the trick but you still have to win+D and click on the desktop for this to work. They put the start button back in windows 8.1 (they figured it was a mistake) but you have to right click the goddamn button (like it's secondary to the STORE). In addition, the traditional windows panel comes at a very low resolution. The font and the icons are pixelated while the headers are high res (try the device manager for instance). - track pad functions: they will make you nuts in the moments of deceits. While your struggling to install the goddamn wifi...you will see all kinds of windows switches...it will send you back to metro, back to another webpage, ect. depending on where you swipe and how you swipe. As long as you stay in the middle of the track pad you're safe. That's why they put a huge track pad...so that you can use the middle. But do not go too far, there are dragons and giant calamaris that will turn windows 8 into a freaking strobe light. This is a track pad not a touch screen!  My final word is that I hated the product as it came. It was useless. I had to fight hours to get it to the point where I am satisfied. So one star: I hate it. I am still not happy with win8 and contemplating win7 but the drivers are win 8 only (supposedly). So I may be trapped in the new microsoft crap. Ubuntu? maybe. I am in a stage where I do not mind re-installing an OS. What a freaking drag!!!
I hate it  The laptop received broke within 3 months of use due to faulty wiring.
not happy with the cloud  the device is ok, not happy with the cloud drive Update; The device crashed within under a year after purchase. I attempted to recover several times with an ASUS program with negative results. It's home now is in the junk pile in my office. Bad bad purchase.
It does come with 8gb RAM and with a very poor i7 at only 2ghz  When I saw the specs for this computer I was expecting way too much for what I received. It does come with 8gb RAM and with a very poor i7 at only 2ghz. The graphics are Intel Family Graphics which performs very slow and also takes forever to turn on. The touchscreen is very responsive and the led-lit keyboard looks pretty nice. But that's all this laptop is about, the looks. Regarding performance I wouldn't recommend it.
Unlucky hardware chance!  For reference I got the Intel i7 with the 960M GPU.  Mine must have been an unlucky model because it has been plagued with problems since the day I got it. It crashes with a blue screen of death due to errors in the RAM, the cursor drivers spaz out for no apparent reason. I had it returned to be repaired, but the touch pad still doesn't work and the crashes are still happening.  This was supposed to be an upgrade from my four year old college PC. My old computer only had an Intel i5 CPU, no GPU, and that little netbook is more stable and starts up faster than the Acer Aspire Nitro.  I attempted reinstalling Windows on it but that didn't resolve these problems. It also comes with a load of bloatware that is almost comical. Overall avoid this computer if you enjoy doing things with your laptop.
Poor Quality Control / Dead Within 2 Years  There were several quality control issues with my ASUS. Most notably, pressing the touchpad creates a loud clicking noise. I looked online and realized that this is a common quality control issue with the ASUS Zenbook. Some users opened up their laptops and inserted padding into the laptop to reduce the noise, but I'm not trained / confident to do that on my own.  And now, less than 2 years after my purchase, my Zenbook regularly shut offs when I pick it up, even when the battery is fully charged. Now, if I leave it unplugged over night, the battery is completely drained int he morning, even if I put it on sleep mode. When I plug it in and try to turn it on, it'll shut off during start up, and I have to wait for it to charge for about 10 minutes before I can attempt a successful start up. I've gone to laptop repair shops, and they've all informed me that it'd just be cheaper to buy a new laptop. I tried to save a few bucks by buying an ASUS instead of a Dell, and I made the wrong choice.
Cannot Recommend  I cannot recommend this product. Upon receiving the computer, I turned it on and began to use it for normal web browsing, and in less than an hour a blue screen appeared with an error code. Per Acer's recommendation, I initiated a reset to factory settings. Doing so initially fixed the problem, but then after less than 2 hours' use, the same blue screen re-appeared, prompting another factory reset. I then tried to do a second reset, which set off an unending loop of the computer booting up a certain amount (usually 86%), then saying there was an error, and trying to restart. It never properly booted up again, and I had to return it.  I don't know whether this was exclusively a hardware issue or if Windows 10 had something to do with it. Either way, I advise you to find a better quality machine. Even at this low price point, I am confident you can do better.
It's about worth what you pay for it. If speed is something you value, get something else.
Absolute garbage. Without question this is the worst computer I have ever owned. It crashes and locks up on pretty much every time I use it, the battery life is about half of what they claim, it's noisy... I could go on but you get the point. Don't waste your money on this laptop.
Pirates  Buyer beware!  I received everything, but the Windows 7 was a pirated version.  I had to spend an additional 60 bucks to get a product code that worked.
I've Owned 10+ Dell Laptops -  This one is my least favorite  I always buy Dell laptops and will continue to do so - this one is the worst to date. I bought it quickly on Amazon last year, and in my rush, missed noticing a couple of feature deficits. It is a very low-end machine. roughly equates to a big tablet with keys/mousepad. It also has a poor design for the Hard-drive SATA connection (see below).  Here are the cons: Lack of RJ45 jack for wired connection - inconvenient. Lack of CDROM drive - very inconvenient Very slow BIOS initialization and boot of Win8 or Win10 upgrade WD 500G HD failed just before one year warranty - Possibly from rough service but not sure since it was with my daughter at the time. HD replaced by Dell under warranty. SATA connection to motherboard is via a small flex-cable (unlike other Dell's I own)... While opening the MB flex connector to replace the HD, the connector latch-mechanism cover, broke and popped off.  The latch cover cannot be put back on due to a broken plastic nib on the end which normally retains the latch and allows it to rotate. I have kluged the flex back into the connector with a tiny cardboard shim and a piece of foam which compresses when the bottom cover is put back in place. New HD works fine but will need finessing again if the HD is removed or replaced.  Last week purchased a Latitude 3440 as a replacement for my daughter -  The new-in-box 3440 is an older 14" model which is now available for roughly the same cost on Amazon.  It is a much better machine and BTW has no intermediate flex for the SATA connection.
Worked fine...  FOR ALMOST THREE HOURS...  When I opened the box and set it up everything seemed fine, I was thrilled. However during the initial backup of the factory default settings, the screen would occasionally flicker and go black. The flicker and black continued, with more frequency until the screen finally went black and would not come back. Perhaps it was as simple as a loose connection or as bad as a defective monitor/screen.  Either way I did not pay for a defective item and sent the thing back the following day. To their credit, Amazon accepted and processed the return and subsequent refund very promptly, with no hassles. Acer has always been among my favorite brands, but I was extremely disappointed with this product. Not only due to the obvious defect, but also the fact that while shopping for a replacement for this unit, I discovered many other reputable brands with the same or better components at very close to the same price and sometimes less. Prior to making my purchase I read through all the reviews and noticed a fair number of negative reviews. (About 15% were 2 stars or less) There will always be some folks with are unhappy with a purchase due to defects and unmet expectations so I felt the odds were in my favor.  Henceforth I believe I will focus on the 5 star, positive reviews. For this unit they account for about 52% of the overall ratings. (Only 1/2 of the purchasers were truly happy) In the future, I plan to look for items (not just computers) with a minimum of 75% 5 star ratings, preferably more like 85 to 90 percent...  Lesson learned. My recommendation: Continue shopping around and you will find a bigger HDD, probably more memory and a comparable processor for very close to the price of this unit. Also, read the reviews and note the number/percentage of five star reviews.
Product has defective battery. As soon as I detach the wall adapter, the Chromebook turns off.
You don't want to know!
Not good  I wanted something cheap and that is what I got. It has been in for repairs often. I would have made a smarter deal by buying new for a little bit more. I would not buy a used computer again
Kinda disappointed with the display. Not as fast as I expected it.
Looks good on paper, but...  Pros On the plus side, 500gb hd, 4gb memory, large screen, remote control for watching videos, plenty of external ports, built in webcam and microphone.  Cons No bluetooth, runs very hot (90C+), loud fan, poorly designed power connection, poor battery life (<1hr), large/heavy laptop, hard to find carrying bags to fit.  Bottom line: If you want something that does all this, stick to desktops. Too big/heavy to really be portable, with the heat and power issues I won't be buying another HP.  I've owned the HP Pavillion DV7-1451nr for about 1 1/2 years. Initially I was very excited because it was a good price for the specs and I wanted a large screen. It arrived well packaged with all the bells and whistles. I soon discovered that it puts out a ton of heat and was too hot to put directly on my lap. Also, the fan was running all the time and is loud enough I couldn't work on the laptop and hear the TV. I bought a laptop cooler which helped (add $30 to the price), but still the fan ran all the time. When multitasking, surfing the web, working on a document, etc. the processor temp would regularly be above 90 celsius!! I searched the web about solutions, and everything pointed to undervolting. Unfortunately, the software to help with undervotlting, doesn't work on this model. I only recently found a solution, changing the max power setting from 100% to 99%, which kept the fan from running all the time and the CPU from getting so hot. The next issue is that I tripped on the cord and now the laptop won't charge. Doing a little research, this model has a very poorly designed connection which makes repair/replacements common. Add another $100-150 to the price. As for the battery, it lasts about 45 minutes for me when not plugged in. The case is pretty average. Plastic with metallic keys. On the plus side, 500gb hd, 4gb memory, large screen, remote control for watching videos, plenty of external ports, built in webcam (picture is dark on Skype but not uncommon for other webcams) and microphone.
Very bad design and weak materials  Very bad design and weak materials, the force applied by the hinge broke the upper cover after a three months of use
Two years after the purchase, I've had problems with this machine. It repeatedly shuts off and keeps knocking the internet connection off. Perhaps it's a software problem. I'll have to reset it and find out. I will never get a touchpad again.
died after 3 months  battery is completely dead, won't charge at all, won't even power up while plugged into wall outlet. would not buy again
good but slowly in startup
breakdown in quality control  I've been a loyal Apple customer for years, but will never buy another product from this company. As has happened to so many other people (google it!), the charger started getting flaky and then just stopped working. Totally aggravating: you buy a $2k+ computer, and it is rendered unusable by a complete breakdown in quality control on a cheap piece of hardware. So, as aggravating as that is, OK, I'll need to buy a replacement. How much? EIGHTY (80) FREAKING AMERICAN DOLLARS! The absolute arrogance of this company, gouging us for THEIR mistake, charging $80 for something that can't possibly cost more than $5 to manufacture.  Never again.
Touchscreen stopped working in a month  Buy a different brand, product is inferior.  Buying a touchscreen computer without the touchscreen working is like buying a bicycle with the pedals missing.  I'm certain that more problems will creep up over time.
[EDITED] Second time was NOT the charm  [EDITED 27 DEC 2013] Thanks to Amazon and their amazing customer service I have gotten a full refund and will never buy another Acer product again. Spending the amount of money this S7 costs should get you a laptop that is pretty much the best thing since sliced bread, however it this laptop fails in so many ways. I have always been an Acer fan and have purchased nothing but Acer's since I can remember. I woke up one morning last week to find that my hard drive had failed. I know that this can happen with any laptop and sometimes you just get a lemon of a HD, but this was just the straw that broke the camels back. After upgrading to 8.1, the sleep function would act erratically and would often times require me to do a hard reboot. The screen would register phantom touches and switch programs on its own. The trackpad area was starting to scratch the display. The touchpad was subpar at best. Wifi would drop intermittently.  If you are considering buying this laptop, just read through all of the negative comments and the hassle Acer put those customers through to get their issues resolved. For some of the issues I listed above, I spent over 2-3 weeks on their support forums looking for help and suggestions to fix some of the issues with no real help. If this laptop was around $900 with the same specs (unrealistic I know), I still wouldn't buy it.  ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW: I had my first S7 for about a week before I noticed a dead pixel in the upper left hand corner. The laptop had a few "quirks" as well with the track-pad and random phantom inputs on the touchscreen, but I just originally thought hey maybe its windows 8. I know some people had complained about the space-bar not working 100% of the time, I had also experienced the same thing. It wasn't a huge deal for me, so I could over look that as well.  Overall I was satisfied with the laptop but not impressed as I had originally hoped I would be, especially spending as much money as I had. It was the dead pixel that pushed me over the edge and had amazon send me a replacement. That was the best thing I could have done. The replacement laptop has none of the issues my first one had. So it tells me that quality control is an issue, but also there are multiple versions of this S7 with different hardware configurations. The first S7 had synaptics track-pad whereas this one has ELAN. It makes me wonder what else is different. The only thing that I can see different from looking at the tags on the bottom of the laptop is the MFG date. The first one has 08/15/2013 and the second one has 09/15/2013.  Overall I am really happy with this laptop. It's fast. Coming from standard HD the SSD is blazing fast. Start-up time is a matter of seconds (under 10 seconds easily). Light, very firm build quality. Great battery life. This is on the pricey end of the scale but considering everything that comes with it, I would say its well worth the price.
Mouse touch pad stopped working within 3 days after It had arrived
Upset... Haven't had it for a week. It will freeze up , then when it's  unfrozen the sound will not work. Which make me have to restart the whole laptop. I've done it twice already.. Not please
I would not buy another  Less than 30 days after the warranty expires, the battery begins to die.  Normally a moderate disappointment but in this laptop, the battery is only reachable after you disassemble the whole laptop!!!  Nice machine except for this, an unforgivable shortcoming.
Not a good product in the end  I had this laptop for a while and it worked just fine, but as the days went by the computer started to slow, not because of the Internet that I have but just how terrible this laptop is, I know people try and ignore the bad comments and focus on the good ones, but I personally would go for and HP laptop that ranges from 400-500$. HP laptops win over Dell.
not happy  Not what I was Expecting Is very limited use :( I'm not sending back because I'm lazy to do it.
Defective laptop that started to fall apart a week after receiving and was completely unusable within two years
... 17 in completed basic set up with email functioning fine & searches to decide software needed etc for several ...  I received the HP Envy 17 and completed basic set up with email functioning fine & searches to decide software needed etc for several days . Today, I could not get the laptop to turn on. I charged it & light indicated full charge but cannot get it to respond.  All reviews on Amazon were good as well as other reviews on line before ordering this HP. However,  I've found complaints on Google of the same problem from 2014  & 2013.  Could the laptop I've received be manufactured in those periods? It is peculiar to have a notice from HP pop up warning that the warranty ends  in June 2015 & extending warranty will cost xxxx.  I've purchased this in March of 2015.  With a standard one year warranty, it means to me that this may be from a line or batch with this problem. Needless to say, I'm very disappointed but better to discover now. I am returning this HP to Amazon--appreciative that Amazon is so helpful and reliable, one reason I use Amazon. I have used a Mac for several years but thought it best to have two different systems, one for business the other for personal. I am going back to Mac with the Apple store about 10 miles away where I can get immediate help if needed. Again, better this happened before I became dependent on its reliability, as according to consumer complaints getting HP responses, even for newly purchased item, is a nightmare.
2nd laptop out of box with issues  Wi-Fi issues right out of the box. updated bios, all drivers, contacted dell, still having issues. wifi is slow, drops and requires restart, sometimes cant find network. Nvidia won't connect or update right out of box. Very little bloatware. Not a fan of the integrated mouse but it's better than most.  If you want dedicated right and left click on laptop this isn't for you. No AC Wi-Fi which doesn't matter unless you have an ac router, you can upgrade that with a $10 USB chip. if you plan to upgrade ram and hard drive to ssd. Easy and won't cost much.
it's extremely slow it's about as fast as one of those computers that took up a whole room there are other laptops out there for  This laptop is a nightmare, it's extremely slow it's about as fast as one of those computers that took up a whole room there are other laptops out there for the same price and their better. This laptop can only get about 5 minutes of Internet usage before it just stops working all together. I have windows 7 installed on it and in the desktop widget I have the cpu meter and it goes to 99% just loading Google chrome this is the worst laptop in history
Well my laptop just quit working. It will not take a charge at all. So I look at my power cord and it isn't even an acer charger. Now I am just hoping that if i get the right charger that it will charge up?????? Not at all pleased
Not happy.  It was broken screen. Not happy.
Should be sold in stores not mail order as tech is elders bag  At my age and handy cap of right hand was hard to set up had to take it to someone quafiied  Plus it will not all I wanted
Cheap  I bought this because I broke my mac and needed something to type papers for school on. It comes with your standard virus protection which you have to purchase after 90 days. When it expired my computer started running slower. I dislike PCs because they force you to buy spyware and are slower than Macs. The only plus is I was surprised at how large of a screen I got for my money. Overall very disappointed.
Dell is the worst company I have ever dealt with.  DELL is a piece of crap. My unit is still under warranty,it has been sent back to DELL four (4) times for major repairs: 1. Hard drive defective and had to be replaced (2) Had to be sent back a second time and they replaced the Palm rest (3) again had to be sent back because they had to re-install the Operating System (4) again had to be returned because the Optical Drive was defective and had to be replaced. Guess what, yup you guessed right it has to go back again because the keyboard/touch-pad is defective ( I was told the mother board needs replacing) but Dell is avoiding that issue. I finally told them enough is enough I want a REPLACEMENT, NOPE, NOTTA, NO WAY IS THAT GOING TO HAPPEN instead DELLS idea is to send me a REFURBISHED unit, thus totally blowing off their responsibility to honor their warranty. Also I will mention that I had to drive to a Fedex outlet 60 miles (to and fro) four (4) times, Dell does not get back to you via email in a timely manor, calling them is a no no because you have to repeat yourself over and over with a different person each time from all over the world and trying to understand them is not an easy task at best, each call to Dell would last about 1-1/2 hours (once it took three (3) hrs.. By the way I purchased this from WalMart and within three weeks I started having problems and they as well REFUSED to take it back because they said it was out side the two week window for returns and I had to deal with the Manufacturer (Dell). What kind of BS is that, that even WalMart will not take back a defective item.
Pathetic  keyboard....!  Laptop  configuration  was  good(good  cpu,  good  hdd,  good  memory,  etc),  but  the  keyboard  was  so  bad,  looked  like  it  was  made  for  $2  in  some  teenager's  garage...returned  it...!!
I do not recommend this for anyone  I got my new computer today and all I can say is I hope they will take it back and refund my money. In less than an hour  this thing was so hot you couldn't touch the bottom and in a hour and a quarter the keyboard got hot. This is the 4th Lenovo computer I've had and it is not even in the ballpark of the other 3. I do not recommend this for anyone.
13.3 mbp with 8 gb ram upgrade  After a couple of lemon PC products, I chose to try out a Mac hoping that it would provide a quality experience on par with its price. First off, I really do like my MBP... once used to the OS it is pretty easy to get around, and the overall build is great... eg the keyboard is one of the best to type on. But about a week after I got it, it started to randomly lose wifi... sometimes once a day, sometimes five times in five minutes. I contacted Apple Care 3 times about the issue. They did what they could (which was nothing except tell me that they would fix the problem over and over without ever admitting that there was a any "real" problem). Though friendly, Apple Care was far from truly helpful. I looked up online and found that this is a persisting and common problem with Macs. Apple refuses to admit that there is a problem and maintains that even though there are thousands of bloggers with their own angry stories. Macs are sold and marketed as a business and school laptop... but it fails miserably since it cannot be relied upon for a business transaction or a online test (my sister bought the same one and has the same problems... she prays every time she takes an online exam it doesnt disconnect). On top of that the track pad is now randomly becoming unrsponsive to trying to click a selectioin and sometimes even just to move the cursor. My sisters has similar problems to include "losing" the cursor and spending a good thirty seconds messing with the track pad to get it to reappear. 1200 bucks for a laptop that cannot do the simplest things correctly... on top of all that, I have been restarting it at least once a day to keep it working... eg skype camera won't work unless I have just restarted it and my internet when connected will not work until I do the same. GOOGLE these problems and YOU WILL SEE that I am not alone.... What a dissapointment.
Hard drive gave up just after the year mark
Bad wifi connection  Faulty item. Purchased this item 3 months back and wifi signal keeps on dropping off every now and then. I did not use my laptop that much in 1st month so couldn't notice the issue. Now I cannot return it back as 1 month has already passed out. Really amazon should not sell such faulty items and cheat their customers. God I trusted amazon so well and now I am completely ripped off because of this !!!
dont buy it here  I purchased this laptop on January 6th 2006 and was told it would ship within one -two business days.......Here we are on the 23rd of January and it still hasn't shipped.  BUT, it gets better.  Not only have I waited this long for it to ship, but I am being told that I cannot cancel this order either since its "so far along in the shipping status"............DONT BUY IT
Totally disappointed and have purchased a Dell from Dell  This was my second replacement of this computer, both arrived with a defect.  Totally disappointed and have purchased a Dell from Dell.com
I really want to like this...  It's an awesome little laptop. The touchscreen works great, keyboard is nice, love the small form, and it has an amazing price point. The Celeron is more than capable of the menial tasks I was using it for, however there's one annoyance and one fatal flaw.  The annoyance: You can't turn off the adaptive display permanently. When darker colors fill the screen, the monitor dims. When lighter colors fill the screen, the monitor brightens. Smart idea to save power, if it wasn't annoying as hell. The settings seem to re-enable themselves every time you reboot, so you have to keep turning it off, over and over.  The flaw: Touchpad. It starts off working fine, you'll notice Synaptics lags a bit when you use the multitouch scrolling. Then you'll notice Synaptics eating CPU cycles when you're not even touching it, and eventually multi-touch will stop working. No more scrolling, no more tap to click. You'll have to use the physical button to click. Occasionally it flips out and the cursor will start flying all over the screen, clicking at random. Eventually it will just stop working, and not start working again until you shut down the computer completely, and start it back up.  I've tried every driver available for it, including some that were intended for other touchpads. I've tried updating the BIOS. I've tried uninstalling the drivers completely and have Windows think it's an old PS/2 mouse. The problem still persists after booting into Linux. It's impossible to get it working properly. You can use it for an hour or two before it starts happening, or ten minutes. It's sporadic, yet persistent.  I rarely return things, but unfortunately in this case, it's going back.  If anyone else is having the same issue, just Google "Inspiron 11 touchpad" without the quotes, and click on the first result. There are still people actively trying to solve the issue.
No computer from Dell is good  1 check the speaker sound there all low and junk ,Check the consumer feed back  and last but most important is the dell set up for customer help is a scam you get no support none as in none your told to go on line and ask for help  like a beggar  don't buy Dell
Sold me a fried hard drive  Don't use this seller, I needed a laptop ASAP and they shipped me a laptop with a burned up hard drive. I have an ASUS desktop, and I haven't had any problems with it so far, so my issue isn't with ASUS, it's with whoever me a busted laptop that I have to send to get repaired when I needed it for work starting last week. I hope whoever sold me this spends that money on something worthwhile.  P.S. The customer support at ASUS was excellent and fast, I have to send it in, but I suspect my issue wasn't the fault of the manufacturer, so far I've had no problems with their products.
I bought this laptop specifically because it was advertised as having Windows 7 with an option to upgrade to Windows 10.  When we booted this up the first time, it started in Windows 10 without any option.  I wanted Windows 7, NOT 10, due to some programs and apps that I intended to install.  I have contacted the seller, but it looks like I will have to wait for them to get around to replying.  Meanwhile, I have a computer I can't use.  Also, the computer froze within 10 minutes of the initial setup, and I had to do a hard boot in order to turn it off.
Lenovo ideapad 100 review one day old  Just received in mail and was packaged well by Amazon.  I do not like it.  The sound from the built in speakers : Conextant Smartaudio HD are the worst speakers I have ever heard in my life on any machine, Computer, or audio device.  I went to all the setting areas for sound and they are at max.  Lenovo should be embarrassed.  I went to ask for help at Lenova and I am putting in the correct Serial Number and it says it cannot be found.  There is a driver for the Sound I found but am not bothering taking the time to try to reinstall.  I am taking off a few games I put on and sending it back to Amazon.  Luckily I ordered an Asus by mistake and was going to sent "it" back, but it should arrive in a few days and I shall check it out instead I am sending this clunker back.  And I am the type of person that does not criticize but try to find the good in everything. Having all the ports on the left side is not helpful either and also the keys do have a tinny sound when you are typing.  Just a bad purchase.  My father has a Lenovo by brother selected and I found that one to be really nice but I do not think it is the Ideapad.....not a bargain either at $495!  Keep looking or a better computer.
what a pile of junk, said this unit with WIN10 was downloadable to WIN7/64, it was not unable to contact lenovo, this is company has no idea of customer service.  don't order this unit unless you want trouble
the laptop worked for 2 days then it would only come on in safe mode. I was so excited for it to get here. like I said it worked good for two days  then we ran a scan it said internal hard drive damage every thing was crashing.i did rate this item when it first happen and have had no response from anyone I paid 128.00 it had a 30 day warranty witch I cant find .so I guess its money down the drain like my first laptop.also the first and last item I will ever buy on amazon.i just cant afford to throw away money. and if it takes two weeks for some one to respond  who needs that it did not take two week to get my money.
disaster  The discription said battery checked but obviously that is not a true because I have to have and keep a charger with me all the time because of the battery. #Notagoodthing
terrible...returned it  NB, I probably got a lemon (that's what my friends say, at least).  I bought this MacBook Pro to replace my six-year-old PC (a Sony Vaio), but it was basically no better than my old PC, so I returned it.  Big problems: it took 36 seconds to open Microsoft Word.  Why on earth would a brand new computer take that long?  It dropped the wireless connection incessantly (no, it wasn't the internet's fault, because my iPad and my Vaio both could hold the connection from the exact same place in the house). The computer woke up from sleep pretty quickly, but it took at least 60 seconds to boot.  So, I returned it, and instead I got an Acer Aspire, which I love (it's 2.5lbs, i7, 256GB SSD, and it was $950--to get a MacBook Air like that, it would cost $1700).
Sucks  This computer stinks. I read the reviews and most of them are good so i bought it. worst 400$ i ever paid. it is slow. the youtube, itunes and any video playback is basically unwatchable because of how bad it is. the internet is slow. booting up is slow. downloading is slow videos suck. camera sucks. i would by any other computer other than this one.
Terrible keyboard  I'm not sure why no one has mentioned this yet but the space bar on this computer is seated very low.  That results in the side of your thumb hitting the edge of the computer case every time you hit the space bar.  So unless you type in such a way that your thumbs are elevated and poke the space bar from above instead of pressing the space bar from behind, you will have a very painful typing experience.  The Dell Inspiron 14R is very similar to the 14Z but doesn't have this problem.
TERRIBLE product. Died within 1st year  The hard drive failed. Replacing it with SSD now but wow these guys did a terrible job of refurbishing. It had multiple issues before finally dying. And I take good care of my laptops- the last one I had before this lasted for ~5 years. wish there was someway for me to get a refund on this horrible computer.
DIM screen, strains my eyes  Took about 1 hour to get everything setup including Windows 10 update. This laptop has a beautiful finish and it's relatively thin/light. The keyboard feels nice and it's ergonomic, I didn't have any issues with getting used to the keyboard and key locations. My chief complain and the reason why I gave this laptop a 2 stars rating it's the screen brightness. Even at the brightest setting, I feel like I was still straining my eyes but that may be because I'm coming from MacBook Pro and Dell XPS 13 which are higher end laptops. This would be an awesome laptop if screen brightness was better
Good until screen goes out.  Worked for almost a year, screen went out sent it back under warranty they fixed it. 2 months after 1 year warranty expired, screen went out again.
Dead within a year - last Dell I'll ever buy..  I bought directly from Dell...  Less than a year old, but when it was delivered the keyboard was a bit warped. It performed well for months, then [of course] the keyboard problems started. It would mistype in a wonderful variety of ways. The touchpad stopped working a week ago. At that time, the wireless connectivity now to be relinked every other day. I moved my files off to an external the day before the internal drive crashed.  I opened the unit up [obviously voiding the warranty - but I'm not buying a Dell again] and the keyboard to circuit board ribbon latch had no secure closure tabs on it! There were a couple of odd bits of masking tape holding this thing to that thing to the other thing. I attempted to reconnect the keyboard to the circuit board with electrical tape but no go. Perhaps I should have used Chinese masking tape. Hard drive was still FUBAR so off to the closet alongside a 2005 Toshiba Satellite that lasted 6 years until the screen blew.  Mine will go to an electronics recycler that I'm sure will send all the sh! t back to China to be remade into more laptop components. My wife has 2 similar Dells with no major problems - but I'll reward Dell's product inconsistency by taking my purchases to another manufacturer.
Regretting  Got this laptop a week ago ran ok kinda slow and laggy on the desktop and opening files, actually had to use task manager to close  few apps that were froze.. today it was updating and got stuck in loading up it said "working on featers100%" won't load past it now I have to wipe the whole computer. yah im happy I paid 1500$ for it to break after 5 days. what a joke.
Seller misrepresentation / wrong product shipped  Massive issues with the product.  It was not a Windows 7 Pro device, the case was cracked, stated "HDMI" not the "mini HDMI"  and now after less than 60 days after I started using it, the battery has to be replaced.  Yes I bought a Square Trade warranty but getting that fulfilled is a bigger pain  Finally, when trying to reach the seller, they apparently don't exist any longer.  AND there is supposed to be a 90 warranty on the PC.  Can't find the seller // cant get the warranty dealt with.
Don't waste your money.  We returned this 3 months after purchase because it would no longer charge and were happily sent a replacement.  Six months later, the keyboard stopped working properly.  Now it is no longer eligible for return.  A complete waste of money.
Crummy computer.  Even crummier tech support.  I thought this would be the perfect little laptop for me.  It was small, lightweight, and had the basics.  It was a good price.  All I wanted was something for word docs, the internet and mail.  It seemed like a perfect fit.  Was I ever wrong!  The 2nd week I had it, it stopped opening.  I contacted Acer Tech Support and the guy said he'd help if I bought a Support Package for $179 - $only $20 less than the computer itself cost.  I told him no and took it to a friend's teenager who figured out the problem.  A month later, I opened it up and the keyboard no longer worked.  Again I called Acer Tech Support.  Again, we'll help if you pay us $179.  I said the thing's still in warranty.  Nope.  Pay-up.  I refused and took it to a computer place.  They got Acer to take it back for repairs.  That was 6 weeks ago.  I really wanted to like this little laptop but it turned out to be the worst thing I've ever bought.  And the Tech support was even worse.  Update:  Finally got it back after 6 weeks.  Then it locked up again when Microsoft updates tried to load.  .  Acer wouldn't help so I took it to another tech place.  Here's the Tech's note to me:  I worked with tech support yesterday and they were unable to successfully assist me in removing the recovery partition to free up space.  After more windows updates installed, while I was doing this, the available space went down to 2.7 GB.  They said once  a recovery backup was created using the build in Acer Recovery Management, that Ill be able to reclaim the 10GB space.  But, thats not what happened.  So, they suggested using a 3rd party tool to delete it.  I did and then the system wouldnt boot up. To fix that, we had to go back to factory settings, which put back that 10GB hidden partition.  They apologized and said that well need to upgrade the hard drive to a bigger one.  Just a note, there is not much space on it even though I have stored no documents on it and very few apps.  Did I ever choose the wrong device...
Upgrade to XP!!  Screen is not that great, Vista is worse than terrible.  I went through the long process of finding the needed drivers and "Upgraded" to XP.  Not a bad PC for the money though.  Works much better now with XP.  I run several control applications that will not work with vista.  HP & MS were no help at all.  Other than the screen and the OS, not too bad if you have the time & OS to put into it!
this is the most terrible product ever  this is the most terrible product ever. The battery overheats and shuts the computer down...even after i got a new one. there is no windows installed on here as claimed. i tried to access things in the laptop and it said Fraudulent software computer lockout. PIECE OF CRAP!! BUYER BEWARE these people are scam artists. Hope you enjoy my money you thieves.
AMENDED: Disappointing dog-slow crap after a year  This laptop packs a lot of power for a decent price. So far performance has been good. There is a fair amount of Acer crudware installed, which I wish there wasn't.  The keyboard layout is very cramped and not great. I purchased a full-sized keyboard to use with it.  The over all FEEL of the machine is that it is made from cheap materials. The entire shell is plastic. If you crave the sturdy aluminum of a Macbook you will be disappointed.  Overall a decent computer for a good price.  ------------------------------- I'm amending my review after about a year's worth of usage. Above is my original 4-star review. I'm downgrading to 2 stars due to the serious performance issues with this laptop after a year of usage. It is sluggish and slow. I've experienced hard drive corruption. Now I get frequent "display adapter has stopped responding and has recovered" freezes and messages. No, I do not have a virus. This is just a cheap piece o' crap.
Subpar  I've owned this for about a year. Several months ago the left mouse button started to fail; it double-clicks every time I use it. The machine is still usable, but I have to carry around a portable mouse for it.  The touch screen constantly spazzes out and the screen is so small that it's not as functional as you might hope it to be.  Windows 8 stinks. It just does. Of course it's not ASUS's fault that Microsoft made a crappy OS. But you're the person using the computer and whose "fault" it is isn't really going to matter when you're using a crappy system. So know it going in.
Acer 5810T8952  Jus bought 1 Acer 5810T8952 from Amazon.com and found that its quality is not meet my need, it always freeze, stuck, this is simply lousy product that i ever seen. it is not comparable to my old IBM T41.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Acer-Aspire-Timeline-AS5810T-8952-15-6-Inch-Laptop-8-Hours-Battery-Life/dp/B002C25O8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Acer Aspire Timeline AS5810T-8952 15.6-Inch Laptop - 8+ Hours Battery Life</a> don't buy this Acer 5810T8952, otherwise you will face trouble like me. Amazon is great seller fast delivery but the product itself need to be improved. This note book I sent over to Cambodia and may find the way to get it back to return it to Amazon
Disappoint; No More Acer for Me  I'm a 26 year old new graduate student and I was looking for a good PC to use solely as my work computer in my office for classes and research. I wanted something with enough power to run some data analysis programs and have several programs of web windows open at one time without slowing down.  I also wanted a PC that was portable but still full sized since it would be my everyday work computer and with a CD/DVD drive.  I've owned 2 PC's and 1 Mac in the past, all laptops.  After several days of looking through specs and reading reviews I settled on the Acer Aspire E1-531-4665.  Unfortunately, I have constantly regretted that decision.  Upon unboxing the Acer I immediately noticed the extremely cheap build quality.  It is made of very flimsy plastic and even lifting the screen by one of the corners feels as if I am bending the entire thing.  I have learned to open it with two hands, one placed on the center of the bottom and the other on the exact center of the top part with the screen.  The hole for the webcam is oval in shape while the camera itself is round.  Therefore the camera is jammed into one corner of the oval hole with a gap at the other corner.  The camera is also not flush and tilted so that one side of the small, round camera is sticking out more than the surrounding plastic which the other side is recessed.  The keyboard works fine but it probably the worst keyboard I've used with rough, klinky keys.  I was expecting a lot more for four hundred dollars but overall I would still have given the Acer 3.5 or 4 stars if it performed well despite the cheap build, it did not.  I started the computer up for the first time and navigated through all the bloatware asking me to sign up for this and register for that and start this free trial.  I was not very impressed with the screen resolution.  I had read some reviews and marketing jargon talking about the "wide screen ultra resolution screen" or something like that but I probably should have checked the specs a little closer to see that the max resolution is 1366 x 768 pixels.  After playing around to see what was where and getting comfortable with the new computer I downloaded several programs I needed for different grad courses.  I added a few personal photos to use as desktop backgrounds but otherwise did not add any other photos, videos, movies, or music and specifically avoided downloading any larger programs like iTunes just to be on the safe side and keep this PC running smoothly.  Well after just a few days I noticed that things were slowing down.  Even with just a web browser open the computer would have to stop and wait to catch up.  Then one day after having the computer for a week or two it wouldn't turn on until after a few tries.  I guess I should have known then that this was not the computer I was looking for and tried to return it but I generously gave it the benefit of the doubt and continued using it.  I'm now over two months into using this computer strictly for work (I have a different computer at home that I use for personal stuff).  The Acer continues to run slow, taking a while to turn on and having trouble running 2 or 3 simple programs at once.  Now after some automatic updates it ran last week I can't even log onto the computer.  At the sign in page I enter my password and hit "enter" and it tells me that the "profile services system is not functioning" or something like that and takes me right back to the sign in page.  I was able to find a workaround but it seems to only be temporary.  I understand that this recent issue is probably due to the operating system and not the PC itself but since I bought it with Windows 7 preloaded it's still part of the product.  The login issue was the straw that broke the camels back for me and I am not trying to contact Acer Support for some help or a refund.  I'm not very hopeful since the limited warranty only provides software "support".  Great, I'll get to spend hours on the phone with someone I can barley understand just to have them try to talk me through fixing my PC but I doubt it will solve the underlying issues of the computer running very slowly and having trouble turning on sometimes.  I really need a work computer and if things are not resolved soon I think I will have to just bite the bullet and buy another PC (not easy on a graduate student budget).  I did register my computer with Acer but there's no option after that to click on the specific computer to ask for support.  Instead I clicked the link that said "Need Help" but that took me to a page that couldn't load or didn't exist.  I'm getting a really bad feeling about all of this but I will try to work through the problems and update this review with any news.  For now, I'm resigned to not buying anything else from Acer after this experience.  I could have spent less on a laptop but I paid four hundred dollars expecting a machine that could at least run the programs I use (I'm not talking about playing 3D online games or editing HD video) and have a decent standard of build quality.  The Acer Aspire E1-531-4665 has failed on all accounts.  Edit March 3, 2014  This computer continues to disappoint! It's still running slow and often having issues opening/closing programs.  I've talked with several IT professionals and tried different antivirus and malware protection.  It caught some issues but now says the computer is protected so I feel like these issues have to be inherent in the hardware and software of this machine.  Today it started running VERY slow.  I had 4 or 5 programs open and it took me more than 5 minutes just to close them all (waiting for the computer to close them after clicking the "x" in one window at a time).  I then went to shutdown the computer and that took several minutes.  When I tried to start it up again it would only boot up in safe mode and started going through a recovery process.  That failed so it shut down again.  I finally got it started up again but it continues to be slow.  Maybe I just got a lemon but this thing sucks.  I'm a poor grad student and I am seriously considering dropping $500 to get a decent computer so I don't have to worry about this machine not functioning properly and leaving me without a work computer.
Not satisfied with wifi connection  overall the machine is nice, however, the wifi connection is bad... We don't have any problems with any other computer in our house... So far, the seller has offered to troubleshoot but not replace
factory settings weren't all there... missing key.components  Drivers missing, definite system issues, web cam doesn't work at all - like it doesn't exist on this computer - called gateway(Acer)  talked to 2 people in India - restarted factory settings again, no change. They suggest taking the hours- old  brand new computer and sending it to repair in Texas - don't like the wait or trouble of that. It's new, it should work! Hopefully  pccrush has a better replacement or return policy. This is frustrating-
Pay the money for a real computer.  Within a couple months of buying this computer it started going nuts. Turning off all the time, needing to be updated ALL the time...as a student it drives me nuts cause I have lost work more times than I can count. The touch screen is crap. Because it also goes into the mouse you can't swipe or move the mouse/your finger to far too the left as it will change function. Too far up and you will freeze the screen. It's really frustrating. I am right over a year of owning it and it is now starting to turn on only half the time. When I get a real job I am gonna spend the money on a Mac and take this POS to a bonfire or my dads woodpile. Hate it.
DO NOT BUY IT  DO NOT BUY IT.  it was defective. the keyboard is not working. How can I use a laptop without being able to write? Also the fan is noisy. Definitely returning.
No Bootable Drive to oblivion  So I bought this lap top in December 2011. I bought it for work (I travel and edit) its light design and power was too good of an offer to pass up.  WELL  out of the now 6 months of owning it It has been in the shop 4 times for the exact same problem.  History of my ownership  purchased: December 8th 2011 (certified Acer store) SSD drive fail: Jan 17th 2012 (replaced and handed back turn around 3 business days) SSD drive fail: Feb 17th 2012 (replaced and handed back 3 business day  turn around) SSD drive fail: April 18th 2012 (mailed to service center replaced shipped back received May 1st) SSD drive fail: May 1st (right out of box from fed ex office in Clients office to right back into box. reloaded UI/ Default... which did not work or me when I tried doing in the office? and returned may 8th)  That is a some what typical story from this Acer line. They keep saying the problem is fixed because it leaves their shop working... I just got most of my software loaded back and I'm now nervous to even start work for fear its going to crash on me and I'm going to be back in the same boat as again.  The SSD drive is garbage and all acer is going to do is replace it and send it back. When it breaks again... they will replace it and send it back.  I have been reading up on other version of this lap top and have noticed the same thing happening.  I would love to see everyone pull together to get a recall put out for this garbage.  Over all don't buy this product. There are better and more stable/ reliable companies on the market.  Also if you are calling acer technical support and want to speak to a human voice immediately (even thought it is outsourced and scripted) press the button for sales instead of tech support (normally option 2)
Not user friendly!  This is the most confusing backward device. I bought this for my mother because her pc crashed. She can get on the internet and do some writing but I could not get her printer to work with this computer. No instructions, confusing set up, I did not realize what a pain windows 8 was until I tried setting up this computer for her. Good price but I wish I had gone with something else.
Item came with no windows ,no adapter
Good to use, but very poor poor quality  My experience with that laptop has been very positive when it was working. The mainboard burned after 1,5 years - that NEVER happened to me with any of the IBMs and DELLs.  My recommendation - stay away if you like to lose money.
keyboard issues  I previously owned an ASUS laptop that I was very happy with. Although the graphics are great on this one, I am disappointed with both the mouse and the keyboard. They are very jumpy and touchy. My friend owns the same laptop and has similar issues. Also ASUS is very, very difficult to work with. Lousy customer support.
Disappointed  Got the thing from Apple.com about two months ago, Leopard pre-installed. Very disappointed with it. Here are the reasons: 1. Computer freezes often or won't wake up after having been put to sleep. The only remedy is to force-restart it (use the button). 2. Keyboard becomes completely unresponsive seemingly randomly and without any warning. Solution: see 1. 3. Lots of Tiger-compatible programs are NOT supported by Leopard. 4. The main interface design is ludicrous (e.g. transparent menu bar, semi-transparent 3D(!!?) shelf-like dock at which you have to peer hard to see which apps are running). A prime example of ruining something good while trying to make it better. 5. Case material is a magnet for dust (mine is black, so it's obvious). 6. Power adapter extremely overpriced (as is the whole thing, but that's the Mac tax), so buying a second one for work is no longer an easy option.  Pros? Yeah, there are some, hence the 2nd star.  Advice: wait some, and then wait some more. And then think twice.
Works well, but has an extremely annoying touchpad. Sound of clicking is too loud compared to average laptops, it is very hard to click on and it is almost impossible to drag an item using this touchpad. I really wish they had used a better touchpad on this.
Track pad issues....sending back  I really liked the look and feel of this laptop. The case is a brushed black that looks good.  The keyboard is not backlit but was comfortable to type on and I liked the number pad.  But....the track pad started acting very erratic shortly after I got it.  I did three system resets and a reset to factory settings but the pad still acted erratic.  Life is too short to mess with something so basic to the operation of the computer.  So back it goes.
I do not recommend this.  Have had problems with it forever. It is the slowest laptop I have ever used, it has trouble connecting to Wi-Fi and sometime it doesn't register when I click or the. I do not recommend this.
A Brick If No Internet, And Won't Work With Phone's Mobile Hotspot  This computer has two serious flaws, each of which makes the other worse.  The first problem is, this computer won't connect to my phone's mobile hot spot. I have an iPhone, a very common phone, but I can't get either Bluetooth or the mobile hotspot on my phone to work with the netbook.  The second problem is, this thing is a complete brick without an internet connection. I thought I would at LEAST be able to edit a google document, or save some text, or have some semblance of a file system, but I don't. I can't do anything when I don't have internet.  So basically this netbook will work, but I'm chained to coffee shops and my house, where I have reliable wireless. Completely useless.
Slow as Molasses  I was very unhappy with the Apple MacBook 13.3" laptop computer. It ran so slow I had to return it.
A customer bought this laptop.  Its been nothing but problems.  Slow.  Yesterday it stopped working,  Today less than 6 months after it was purchased its going to get repaired.
Not happy.  It broke and stopped working within the first week of using it.  Called company and they would not assist me.  Having to work with my credit card company now to issue a dispute.  Awful.  And I love and will always love MAC, just got sold a faulty product from a dishonest seller.  ) :
Chromebooks are too limited  Chromebooks *sound* like a cool idea, but in practice they are terrible. Even years later when Google has had time to fix and update the OS, it still remains so limited as to be useless.  A Chromebook is just fine inside of the browser. If all you want is to browse the web and check your email, a Chromebook will seem just fine to start. But eventually, you will want to do something else with it. Watch a video from a flash drive, or connect your external hard drive, or some other basic thing that all computers can do. And when you try to do any of these extra things, then you run into the ugly limitations of Chromebooks.  Sure, there's a file browser in Chrome. But it has ZERO options. Anything you download has to be in the Downloads folder; it won't even allow you to browse anywhere else! If a file or folder is being hidden from view, there is nothing you can do about it. And if you dare to open up a folder with too many videos in it (a portable hard drive, in this case) you will lock up the entire computer just by daring to open the folder. Seriously, what kind of OS can't even handle a folder full of videos?! That's about as basic as it gets!  If you actually want to play one of those videos, you will run into similar frustrations. Yes, there is a built-in video player. And it has no options for you to use. If you are trying to play a video that has multiple audio tracks or optional subtitles, too bad. You don't get those on Chrome. Want to queue up three videos in your playlist? Too bad; there's no playlist! You can only watch a single static file at a time. Even 20 year old MP3 players could do more! Curse your poor luck, and wish you had bought a real laptop instead. Even Android devices have tons more customization than Chromebooks!  Proponents of Chromebooks will say that third-party apps can fix all of these problems. News flash: they don't. No matter which apps you install or try out, you won't end up with a file manager or video player with even a fraction of what Windows can do straight out of the box.  As for the hardware itself, stuck keys on the keyboard and a whiny fan make it hard to appreciate the rest of the laptop.  To Sum Up: There are simply too many things that Chromebooks cannot do, or do so poorly that in practice you cannot use it. Even if all you want to do is browse the web, chances are you will eventually want to do something else with the device. And when you do, you will learn to hate your Chromebook.
Not worth it  It's a hard trade going from windows to Chromebook. I looked up reviews and specs, but I didn't realize how weird this would be. It was a struggle trying to transfer my files from my Windows 8 laptop to this one, and I still don't know if I did it right. Basically, you have to upload everything to the chrome cloud (?) and it stays there. I tried to download it to the physical memory in this laptop and it didn't work (?). It also doesn't support my files...You don't get the same software as windows, and apps are scarce because it's so new. I think the reviews I read were really understating this issue. The other problem I'm having is my internet goes in and out...while my phone and desktop all work perfectly fine with the internet going strong. Not sure what part of the whole set up this would stem from.
Flickering Monitor Failure  I purchased this to replace an older Sony Vaio laptop.  On receipt I really liked the unit, although the UHD display caused some software to display improperly or in an unreadable scale.  On the eighth day after setup it was sitting on my desk running a routine backup program when the built-in monitor began flickering!  I immediately set up video to record the issue.  It continued to flicker and intermittently failed totally to black.  On reboot the problem continued.  I then connected a 2nd monitor via HDMI port. The 2nd monitor displayed correctly with no flickering, while the primary display in the unit flickered and failed to black!  Obviously a defective unit.  FBUY asked for a copy of the video which I e-mailed (as much as I could send).  They authorized a return based on the issue.  The return arrived at their depot on 3/12/15, and I am awaiting credit for the unit to my credit card.  I'll repost with details when the credit is received.  This seemed like  a good unit.  I hope it is only a one-time anomaly, and I hope FBUY rapidly credits my account as I am desperately in need of a replacement unit for my expired Sony Vaio.
IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY  it worked poorly and the CHEAP plastic hing fell off, the back of the computers plastic broke and the bottom corner of the laptop fell off. DO NOT BUY! IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY. YOU SHOULD SAVE YOURSELF SOME TIME AND BUY A MORE EXPENSIVE DELL OR SOMETHING
horrible experience.  horrible experience...computer was working for 1 week and then problems started...windows 10 update went wrong for unknown reasons...a week later, the thing couldn't reboot...the bad thing is that I received it as a gift from America  and I live in Morocco...$420 down the drain...STAY AWAY !!!
Ordered for Christmas and was I disapointed.  I thought I did my best on reviewing for a new notebook but apparently most of the reviewers are misleading the consumer with their substandard testing and personal boas. Never bought an Asus computer before but I own well over 5 laptops and 10 desktops for my business and this new computer was a special Christmas gift to myself.  Several items were of issue but the biggest problem was the wireless speed connected to the internet. I had placed several computers next to the Asus and the speed was a joke. I mean many times I waited minutes for a page to appear. Even when I speed tested the computer it wool time out on the upload test. I search the web for a solution and saw other with the same issues but with no resolution. So I decided to contact customer support. Well Asus customer support is a JOKE. Its all most comical since all the other countries including Mexico had actual contact call in phone number but in the United States it was a CHAT service. So they had NO solutions so Im sending this Asus back to Amazon and will never even consider purchasing from them again. If you're thinking you may have had a solution well Im I electrical engineer in computer sciences and tried everything imaginable spend several hours on this piece of JUNK!
A beautiful laptop that is plagued with problems.  I don't really hate this laptop. I think it is cosmetically appealing but man the problems! I've had the laptop for almost 4 months. The wifi on my unit is horrible. It drops service all the time on reliable networks that simultaneously I have a perfect connection on my ipad and iphone. Neither of those devices have ever dropped signal whereas dropping signal is typically a multiple times a day problem with this laptop. The laptop does randomly restart once in a while and this wouldn't be too big of deal to me if it didn't take 15 minutes to restart when this happens. The biggest problem I worry about popped up today. In the middle of the screen a splotchy circle popped up that refracts the picture. It's only about half an inch as of now but I'm concerned there's something wrong with the screen and the problem will just grow. I'd love to be contacted and have this problem fixed because I do want to love this product!
DO NOT BUY IT
Loved the machine  Loved the machine, had to return it when it lost pixels after a couple of weeks.  Amazon didn't have any others of the same model in stock at the same price and wouldn't price match.  Bought the same one from New Egg CHEAPER and it works great.
Not as described  While the macbook arrived to me looking brand-new, it was not FULLY FUNCTIONAL. First, the track-pad does not work in an up and down motion. Secondly, most of the programs in the computer do not work. I had to restore it back to factory settings and purchase each of the programs. Very vague product description. Extremely misleading. Be very cautious about being any item from buyer, or rather, ask him/her any questions you may have before you considering making that important purchase.
Do Not Purchase  Piece of crap that will not open files or folders. It will not run google chrome. Worst mistake I have ever made. Tried everything to get windows 10 to work correctly. The problem is Windows 10. Asus is a good laptop the operating system sucks. Now I am stuck with a crappy laptop that I can't do anything with. So very disappointed. I have bought laptops on the sight before with no problems. I don't think I will purchase a laptop through Amazon again. I had to give 1 star in order to submit my review. This should be a "no star" product!
6 Hours on Tech Support  I have had several Dell computers in the past, so I expected this one to be as good as the others. I was wrong.  The networking card would not connect to my wireless network. Searching online I found out this was a common issue for new Dells out of the box. I followed the advice of several sites, downloading software (on the computer in the office down the hall) and installing it on this one. No luck.  I called Tech Support. The first woman was confused that she could not connect to my computer to diagnose the problem. I explained that WAS the problem. Two hours later she decided to transfer me to the networking group - and hung up.  I called back. This woman assured me that there was no need for the networking group. She could handle it. She told me it was my router, my service provider, and just about anything else she could think of, none of which worked. Two hours later she said her shift was ending and she set an appointment to call me back the next day.  She did not call. After waiting another two hours, I called Tech Support for the third time. This man assured me that he could fix the two issues - it would not connect with the wireless networking and the Dell 2405FPW external monitor I had would not show the proper resolution. By the end of his two hours, he had told me it was MY fault for buying the wrong computer that wouldn't work with the Dell monitor. (In spite of the online literature that told me Dell has never updated their drivers for that monitor.) And that he would be glad to have me send in the computer, wait a week, and see if they could fix it.  I requested a refund. Then I had to jump through the hoops with two different supervisors reiterating that it was MY fault for ordering a computer without a separate graphics card. And that they would be happy to see if they could fix the networking card if only I would spend a week without my computer.  Not only was I disappointed that I spent so much time trying to work out this issue, but I was also insulted that they put the blame on me Whatever happened to the idea that the customer is always right? I will never buy another Dell - nor will most of my friends, after seeing what I went through.  Check my other reviews to see which computer I bought instead - and love!
Don't waste your money on this laptop  I bought this laptop in August and it's been giving me nothing but trouble since then. One month into this new laptop it started blue screening on me again and again. I did a fresh reinstall of Windows and it seemed to fix the problem but another month later (now) I'm faced with the same problem again. Blue screen after blue screen. I'm just hoping I can finish this post before it happens again. I've passed the 30 day return/replacement policy for Amazon so I need to contact Acer but their customer/technical support is ridiculous. I've talked to 5 different people today and they all gave me different answers. The last person told me that i would have to mail in my laptop for repair services which would take 7 to 10 business days not including shipping! I can't believe they expect me to go 2-3 weeks without a laptop especially when it is brand new! I didn't make any changes to the laptop and have only been using it for school (Word, Google Chrome, Adobe Reader) and I guess this laptop can't even handle that. Don't waste your money on this laptop. The touchpad is also super faulty and the keys are little plastic pieces.  In conclusion, this laptop is very poorly built and Acer technical/customer support is so bad it fails to make up for it.
Not-so-Premium Customer Service  Each time I powered up this computer, I received a message stating that I had one month to register the product (with ASUS).  The link provided with the message would never work.  Tried to contact ASUS by telephone (number was provided by Amazon) and was able to reach no one.  After two weeks of trying, I turned it in.  Since I must demand quality, back to the supplier with this unit.  Additionally, the upgrade to Windows 8.1 was not-so-smooth.  Numerous programs needed to be reinstalled following the "upgrade."  This may be a windows issue but ASUS marketed this Zenbook as simply upgradable.  I'll have to hold ASUS responsible for snags since they are sellers - not MS.  I had been using Dell and HP products for years but decided to give ASUS a try.  This will be my first and last ASUS.  Thanks for your trouble.
Good but 1 HUGE problem  Have had this laptop for 2 days. Everything in the description is as promised so i'm not gonna get into those aspects. The problem is every time you put the computer to sleep when you reboot it the mouse cursor is gone. I have to do a total shutdown 4 or 5 times before the cursor re-appears...I'm writing this review from my other computer because I have restarted this dell 10 times and the cursor has not reappeared- read many troubleshooting techniques on how to fix & none work. Overall very disappointed and may have to return. If anyone knows a fix please let me know  Update: After reading countless dell forums on the issue the problem was never solved- exchanged for a replacement today- will update once the new one arrives to see if it also has the same touchpad problems
i guess you get what you pay for.
Heat right to the Touchpad  I have HP Pavilion dv6 so I decide to upgrade to this laptop (Asus Rog GeForce 960M 2 GB). once I started it I feel a heat right to the touchpad, As i am continuing using it, heat increases and I felt pain in my right hand.
Blue Screen of Death  I purchased this Acer new and within a month of purchase got the dreaded "blue screen of death."  To make matters worse I had to pay to send it back which cost me $50+.  I really wanted this computer to work because it had all the specs I wanted but clearly I was sent a dud.
Pre-installed error  I really hate to print a retraction since I don't like being wrong but I was. It was my failure to properly evaluate the situation and frustration arising from that the sparked my low rating. Have to give it or so 4 stars or so now.
The processor is no the one announced in the characterisitics  It is not the computer I expected, it says 3.2Ghz for the processor in the characteristics and when I received the computer and checked the specifications the processor is 2.4 Ghz . It is not fair and need a refund.
Do not buy this 200$ laptop  Main problem, the keyboard, when you are typing it disapears making a big mess in what you are trying to write. Just pay a little more and get a better netbook.
Not loving this laptop need help!  I can't find the Office 365 product code I'm supposed to have. This is supposed to be free for the first year. Also, the keys don't work very well. I'm a fast typist and it seems to only recognize hard slow keystrokes.
Horrible laptop worst purchase ever.
erratic touchpad  From the first run the touchpad was behaving oddly.  The multi-touch features (pinch to zoom, etc.) were partly to blame but there were still severe problems with those disabled.  The cursor was basically uncontrollable and no amount of fiddling with settings could fix the problem.  The problem seemed to go away, and the computer worked great-- until it reappeared.  It seems the problem is provoked when the AC power cable is plugged in, and the touchpad becomes unusable.  This is really a shame because it is a great computer otherwise.  (I did get complaints about the loud clicking from the mouse buttons, however.)  I returned the computer, but it might just be an isolated problem.
Don't buy this piece of crap.  I bought this in April of 2017 and now it's not working. It doesn't keep a charge and will not start any longer. It's very disappointing.
This isn't really a Thinkpad and far from the old T-Series machines I have used. Its more in the family of Thinkpad Edge. The whole trackpad is messed up big time and something in design is not correct as I am just not being able to get accustomed to this machine. I have been using Thinkpad for years now and I bought this out of habit. If you are a thinkpad user, please don't buy this machine. Also, the CPU performance is at best average, and is poorer than one of my 8 year old thinkpad's. Bad buying decision.
Smh am very disappointed and the laptop is very old  They so lie the laptop is very low on sound,and only the laptop itself I get what happen to the bag,flashdrive,mouse ? Smh am very disappointed and the laptop is very old
If your doing any media do not purchase this computer. SSSSLLLLLOOOOOOWWWWW!!
When I bought this I didn't understand that you could NOT use this computer to read any type of documents unless you're willing to pay an additional $100 for Microsoft office 365. You get a 30 day trial of it for free which is useless because you ultimately have to pay $100 to keep using it. For a cheap laptop, it becomes expensive when you have to add $100 just to be able to read and use documents. I don't understand why they don't just build in a year of office with the program. What looked like a good computer is actually useless if I can't use it to create, read and use documents of any type. Feels like a complete rip off to me and I am annoyed that I didn't understand that when I bought it. It's a great way for Microsoft to take $100 right out of your pocket and very bad customer service. If that would have been more clear on Amazon when I bought it, I would never have bought this laptop. Anyone know of any free programs I can download to not have to spend another $100 for nothing???
Great Except for a Major Design Flaw  My laptop is approximately 6 months old at this point and I have been experiencing problems with the power cord.  The cord has become extremely touchy and most of the time will not make a proper connection to charge the unit.  At first I figured it was a broken wire in the cord and purchased a replacement cord only to encounter the same problem.  After researching this issue on the Internet, I have found that I am one of a very large number of people encountering this problem with the HP Pavilion laptops.  Most people have tried contacting HP support only to be told that it is not covered by warranty and requires you to pay for a full system board replacement.  I purchased the extended warranty from where I purchased my unit and am hoping that they will not tell me the same.  I've always been a fan of most HP products but I'm now dreading the idea that I may have just flushed over $1000 down the drain.  Aside from this problem, the unit is great.  But then, how great is a laptop with no power?
it was password protected and my grandson couldn't use,  it was password protected and my grandson couldn't use, it i called them and they told me what to do and it still didn't work
BAD LUCK  Bad luck, got a dud. I clicked on the list of wi-fi providers, saw mine, Cent. Link, clicked, nothing happened. Closed down, tried again, and instead of the wi-fi list, a list of countries showed up, never saw the wi-fi list again.
... bought this computer in January and I am not pleased with it at all  I bought this computer in January and I am not pleased with it  at all. Please, do not listen to others raving how good this computer is ! This computer is utter garbage save your money and buy a MacBook Pro. I wasted my money on this piece of garbage (computer).
When it works it's a great laptop but I have been less then impressed with the Asus component quality.  Several times a week, sometimes several times a day, I get blue screen crashes due to Memory problems.  The screen quality is nice, and I love the compact size but the reliability is a deal breaker for me.  I still use this system but it has been demoted to web surfing duty only.  I cannot depend on it for much else without risking lost work.  I would advise that you shop around -- I do not think I will buy another Asus computer after this experience.
Upon arrival the bottom row of the keyboard did not work at all. It would only remain on for 30 seconds before shutting off. Fortunately Amazon makes it easy to return without a hassle (unlike Ebay who screwed me on a different item because I didn't post the tracking number for a returned item quickly enough and I lost both the cash and the item I returned.)  Since it never worked for more than 30 seconds I am unable to comment further, although it did seem VERY hefty and its weight of 9+ pounds isn't much less than a compact a51 alienware desktop which offers same performance at half the price. I picked up my alienware desktop for comparison and it doesnt seem much heavier from a 'feel' perspective, I don't know the actual numbers. Potential buyers might want to consider this.
The computer has been haven a lot of problems with it
worst ever laptop  Dont buy! worst ever laptop.  Mouse complete rubbish.  Trust me buy something else!!!!!!!!!
Disappointing old friend  This is a good computer, accepted it freezes every so often. I use Linux and I think that the  operating system is having issues with the atom graphics chip in it. When it does work it's awesome. Just can't watch very many movies play any games or use a second monitor. I love Acer, my last one lasted me over 10 years. So I'm surprised that this is happening. But then again that one was an AMD chipset.  2016 - Finally gave up for a fix and the freeze prevented any productivity on the system.  Research showed OS had nothing to do with this freeze issue.  Just a glitch in the system.  Buying a new system... sorry Acer, it won't be yours.
hardware died in less than 6 months, warranty covered it but had to pay to ship back.
lost it's os. won't take reload of os.  lost it's os. won't take reload of os. first major failure of a new barely used computor in my experience
Don't buy it!  Office 365 is supposed to be included, according to the sticker on the keyboard and the Amazon product description. But Microsoft will only download it if you provide an activation code. The Amazon call center people in India told me to get the code from Hewlett-Packard. The HP tech center told me to get it from Amazon. So I have a notebook that is virtually worthless without WORD.
PIECE OF CRAP!  I've had it for barely a day and the touch screen stopped working! I tried calibrating it and a factory reset, nothing. Called tech support and they wouldn't help me unless I paid them 150 bucks. Sending back ASAP!
Bought this for as a surprise gift for my son, he was very excited until he booted it up and it simply did not work.
Stopped Booting after a week.  Worked great for a week. Suddenly it wouldnt fire up. Waited another day, still didn't boot up. Had a to return back.  Prompt delivery from Amazon though.
Not worth the low price  Purchased it about a year and a half ago with the I3 processor. Very slow, frequent "circle of death" wait times, flimsy hinge recently broke.  Don't let the low price persuade you unless you don't mind spending your valuable time waiting for the thing to complete processes as simple as loading websites and programs.  Not recommended at all.
Faulty keyboard  The "Del" key of the laptop keyboard came faulty. It was stuck pressed, and would not come up. Never touched it. Dell, you do not have proper quality assurance, a product like this should never have left the plant.
We purchased this product in September and I gave it as a gift to my daughter in January.  It will not connect to wifi.
Premature HD Failure  I've had this model for just over 11 months. Hard drive failed catastrophically. (i.e. Hard drive failure is about to occur.  Back up your data... too late)  2 stars for while it was working it worked pretty good.  Don't like the keyboard.  But at the time the price was right.  But that was with the assumption that I could get at least 3 years out of it. I have a new hard drive now. But driver installs are a pain. Let me rephrase.  Driver searches are a pain. (Could vent about Bing and masquerading driver web sites.  But won't)
I bought a Lenovo from Amazon some 3 months ago. Today when I typed my password the screen became black. Any help
Feeling cheated - HP Envy  I've had one for 1.5 yrs.  It has had problems since the beginning.  Sending mine back for repair, soon.  I don't know if HP will fix it and if they do I wonder what they will want to charge me for their poor workmanship. Maybe I recieved a lemon - I don't know.
I don't recommend to buy this computer
The laptop was very nice. My old laptop was an Asus so I was going to stick to that brand. I liked how thin and light it was, but it would not keep the wifi settings. I kept having to reload the wifi adapter. It was very frustrating. I ended up returning it and getting a Dell.
The worst laptop I have ever owned.  I've owned few laptops in my life and this one is the worst by far. The touchpad issue is just unbearable. Sometimes I sit still and watch the cursor just jump all around the screen by itself. Other times, I just cannot control it. It seems like it has a mind on his own and goes wherever it pleases to. I'm not sure what this erratic behavior can be attributed to but my theory is that it's the hardware. I've seen people complaining about the same issue all over the WWW but Asus is unable to solve it which leads me to believe it's the hardware and not the software. Otherwise they would've come up with a new driver. I called Asus about a month after buying this laptop and after hours on the phone with their tech support people who were really "surpised" I had this issue and of course suggested to download a new driver, then new BIOS (none of which fixed it) they asked me to send it to them. Nice, a laptop that was still on the warranty should be sent to the manufacturer and the customer should be left without one for an extended period of time and then possibly going through installing all the software all over again. Asus refuses to just acknowledge they manufactured a defective laptop which is why I will never in my life bu their product again. P.S. I'm not the one who really picks on sound quality but you should hear the sound these internal speakers produce. I keep them muted at all times just out of fear to get a heart attack when something comes out of these speakers. What an awful and horrible sound they make.
Don't waste your money  The Chromebook has to be connected to WIFI at all times. That would be fine, except it won't hold a damn connection and is constantly turning over without loading pages, or dropping the connection entirely. This happens with every WIFI connection, no matter where I am. It is a problem people have reported with Chromebooks of all types for years, and so is most likely an unresolved issue with the Chrome OS. Yet Google continues to release these products with no fix, and no warning.  Not everyone experiences this issue. But enough people do that it makes buying one of these a crapshoot. Since the ASUS C300 doesn't have an ethernet port to tap directly into the web, there is no way around it if you do end up with the connection issue. Don't bother with this device, and get something reliable.
Stops Working after 2 Years  Had for about 22 months. Mousepad/Keyboard is now not working very well. Disappointed in my purchase.
The Amazon wrong with me. Sold me a different notebook announced. In the description says it has a video card AMD Radeon R9 M290X, but in fact is the HD 8970M. This is hurting my updates because I found that the product is not the same and I'm feeling aggrieved .
Arrived broken  Arrived in a very beat up box, and the screen doesn't work. Its all black with these white vertical lines. Very disappointed that I spend $1,700 on something that is completely non functional.
Windows blunder  Hp's rendition of Windows 8 was difficult to translate into useable action.  There seems to be little cross action between the touchsmart and keyboard.
Poor customer service & computer  After my crappy ASUS (they also suck) broke down after 1.5 years, I had to buy a computer for college.  Luckily, after 3 months of normal use I finished school just in time to start having problems. The S****y laptop started having key and touchpad issues; so I called Acer customer service and they told me to ship the computer to their repair center to take a look at it.  I didn't want to be without my computer for 2+ weeks so I decided to put up with it. Theeeen, the computer just died and wouldn't charge. I was sooooo mad, but I didn't want to Shell out another $900 for a computer so I decided to drive 2hrs to their repair center in TX.  They fixed it in 2 days! Woohoo, right...nope, wrong!  I get home and power it on and the computer won't boot, saying that there was not device to boot?????  More pissed offness from me, so I decided to call the repair center back and they told me to call customer service again?!!!!!  Do not, buy Acer unless you want to risk going through the frustrating issues I went through...I mean, imagine if this had happened during finals, and also I invest online, so thankfully I didn't have any important trades to execute...  This could have cost me more tan $900 and gas money...not to mention my time  Would give it 0 stars if I could
Review of Apple Macbook Pro MB133LL/A  The computer we purchased was very very worn and it looked it.  Also, the computer will not power up on it's own and requires it to be plugged in 100% of the time.  I was very disappointed in the condition of the computer, 2 thumbs down.
Not even for the kids  Performance is ok, but glitchy. I hate the limited functionality of the keyboard, and I only use it for the basics! Going back to Acer when this one quits, I'll never buy this brand again.
Mine lasted ONE year and ONE month...  sucks  I have to rate this as a piece of junk.  Started having major issues about a week ago and today it totally died.  All symptoms point to the hard drive.  This is really SAD to pay almost $300 and get one year and one months use.  I did like the fact that it was lightweight, and easy to travel with.  I WILL NOT purchase an Acer product again.
This laptop is a piece of crap. The space bar didn't respond almost from the beginning. The WiFi hardware is dead after less than 2 years of normal use. (FYI: the same thing happened with our previous Acer, which lasted about 2.5 years -- moving to an HP or Dell next.) When it comes to Acer, apparently you get what you pay for...
Horrible purchase!  This is one of the worst products I have ever bought in my entire life. It's slow slow slow slow SLOWWW. Do not purchase. Complete waste of money.
Based On the One I Have I Would Pass on Acer  Worst quality laptop I have ever owned from a quality standpoint. While it is fast and has good graphics the wifi is terrible. I have sat in a room with three other people with three different brands and everyone's reception was fine except for mine. It is really pathetic.  I have also had two other problems develop. First coming out of sleep mode about one in ten times the keyboard does not respond and I have to reboot the computer. This happens with both it's keyboard and with a wireless one. Second the space bar is often none responsive on first try so you really have to pound it.  This is my seventh laptop. Previous ones were three different brands and my view it is the worst from a quality standpoint. I would not buy another product from this manufacturer if it were half the price of everyone else.
BROKEN CHARGER :(  I am looking for someone to email about my product. I ordered this for my boyfriend for Christmas and the charger does not work accurately... It falls out very easily and does not charge unless it's in a certain position. Which also means he cannot use the laptop while it's being charged. I am very frustrated and wish to speak to someone about this. Please contact me by email: kayleeclifton@ymail.com
This is a horrid laptop  I purchased this computer for my law firm. Thus, the usage is for basic office work and nothing more. Three (3) months after purchasing the computer the screen decided to go black. The computer would work with external monitors or with the docking port. After receiving the computer back, however, the computer then refused to recognize any batteries.  I have never had a problem with my Dell laptops and it was a grave mistake purchasing an HP laptop.
Just pay a lil more for something else  Do not buy this product, it has a very slow processor, touch screen function on the mouse constantly needs to be turned off to prevent it from  sliding the screen. Very Bulky product, and constantly freezes. Dell has really falling off on quality.
Not Worth The Money  I don't care for this product as it ran very slow and began to turn on and off for no reason after about two months of use not worth $109 at all especially when purchasing for a high school honors student with lots of papers to write.
I also bought an ASUS desktop computer with a touch screen from a difference source and am not happy with it  I had to return this. There were a lot of problems with it locking up and not working (the same problems I was having with my old computer) right out of the box.  I also bought an ASUS desktop computer with a touch screen from a difference source and am not happy with it. I had problems with it the very first time I used it and should have returned it.  It continually locks up and gives the whirling death spiral. I will not buy an ASUS computer again. I find I am in the same position of needing a decent computer that works well without continually grinding to a halt.
Sony VAIO good product but Windows 8 ruined it  I adore Sony VAIO but the Windows 8 software absolutely ruined the laptop!  Windows 8 has no business on a PC.  I contacted Microsoft and after 2 hours on the phone with them they could not make the software work, then contacted Sony and they even had difficulty setting up the software.  Finally contacted Amazon and thank goodness they provide such stellar customer service and understood I was having an extremely difficult experience with Windows 8 and accepted the Sony VAIO to be returned, which is unfortunate because I have had Sony VAIOs for my laptops for years and have found them to be excellent laptops.  Windows 8 is unacceptable software.
DO NOT BUY THIS HUNK OF CRAP!!  DO NOT BUY THIS HUNK OF CRAP!!!! This is the absolute worst computer ever. Don't even consider buying this total piece of F***** SH***! It's specs suck, the layout is impossible and not helpful, It takes 10 minutes (not kidding, I timed it) to boot up, my wife and I tried unsuccessfully fpor an hour!!!! to get the f***** DVD player to recognize that there was a disc in it, it kept trying to show us random pictures. This is the worst laptop money can buy. DO NOT GET THIS LAPTOP. You will go INSANE because of how slow and awful and useless and poorly layed out and did I mention SLOWWWWWWW!  Anyway, it was cheap so you DO get what you paid for.
so disappointed! The package came with NO protection inside  Zero star for now! Just received the computer today and the screen came totally damaged, with a "crash safety design" on it... the computer does NOT turn on, so disappointed! The package came with NO protection inside. I will try to buy again this same computer with the same company, let's see if this time I receive a good one. Thanks, Thiago
this laptop is great  The problem is Windows 8, specially on a non touch screen computer. Windows 8 should only be on touch screen devices.
Had issues with the screen  I bought this for my nephew to use at school.  Within the first week, I had issues with the screen.  It would splits into two vertical images.  I could not shut the system down with Windows 8 because I could not get the mouse to move to the upper right corner of the screen.  I had to use an external monitor to see the cursor.  I called DELL Tech Service.  They sent a technician to replaced the screen.  This is not a good sign for a new laptop.
so unhappy both laptops broken  i was so happy to received it and when i open the box the screen was broken, i requested a replacement to be disappointed again as when i got the replacement i was happy to see there was no damage until i turn the laptop on and a white screen with lines was the display i'm sooo unhappy because i wanted this gaming laptop for quite a while. :(
Would not buy again  Decent computer when working correctly, but the track pad consistently doesn't work. It won't let me click anything, forcing me to restart the laptop constantly until it does work, even after updating all the drivers.
... doesn't and it keeps saying the product key isn't good for Windows  Runs slow said it has bluetooth but it doesn't and it keeps saying the product key isn't good for Windows and it says it's not eligible for return and I could of got a new one from Walmart that works for 300
does not work for what i need  i did not realize the operating system would not work for the service provider i wanted to use it with. i do not like the fact that it's made to use with google cloud, and that service is free for only 2 years, then you have to pay. i did not realize the operating system was something i was totally unfamiliar with and did not have the programs and features i was used to using.  overall it just did not fit my intended purposes and i chose to return it, and got acer with windows instead, which i am perfectly happy with.
LLego muerta... ni carga ni enciende...  I can not get to start... La computadora llego y no carga ni enciende..I am going to have to return it...
A true lemon  We purchased the Samsung Ultrabook because of its good ratings, but we have had nothing but problems with this computer.  We have owned it for one year and three days.  In that time, it has been in twice for repairs.  The power button, motherboard, hard drive, dc cable, palm rest and AC adaptor have all been replaced.  Today, we had the dreaded blue screen.  Samsung will not stand behind a product that is three days out of warranty.  This is now a $700 paperweight.
Limited access to on line google features  games crash for no reason can't  Skype ????????..
Poor battery life  Due to totally unacceptable battery life, I returned it. I also didn't think the keyboard feel was very good. Sorry I cannot recommend it.
Don't do it  For what is advertised as a flagship model it certainly disappoints it's extremely fragile, the door for the CD/DVD drive has popped off already. The driver graphics card has failed nearly every day promting yet another restart. The battery is not nearly what I expected it runs down over 60% within an hour and half. I'm sick of it frankly and will be looking for a refund or replacement at the very least.
Lousy at best. Returned it after two days  Lousy at best.  Returned it after two days.  It came loaded with Trojans and virus.  Wouldn't let me load my security software.
Non disclosure of sales terms  Stay away from Amazon for this laptop!  I purchased this laptop and Amazon did NOT disclose they drop ship through USA NOTEBOOK of Pompano Beach Fl.  They furthermore do not disclose that USA Notebook only allows 7 days for you to return the computer, and this includes SHIPPING TIME!  I am being screwed by USA Notebook on a return.  The computer is junk.  It freezes up, it kicks your connections off line, and it does very strange things concerning access on websites.  Amazon should disclose the USA Notebook terms of sale.  So if you buy on Tuesday, and it takes three days for shipping, you won't get it until the following Monday. The Commercial invoice will be dated on Tuesday before you receive it, leaving you one day for a return! USA Notebook should allow 7 days from receipt of the laptop, not from their date on their commercial invoice!  Just don't buy this computer through USA Notebook and specifically through Amazon!
DO NOT BUY. 10 times normal price.  DO NOT BUY THIS!!! this is a great laptop, although rather old and with bad specs, but this is barely worth 300$ on todays market. this is a total ripoff and makes me think twice about ever buying from this vendor again.  no i did not buy this computer from price pros, however i do own it. DO NOT PAY THIS MUCH!!!
I bought this for my girlfriend to replace her old laptop and she absolutely hates it. Nothing but complaints and aggravation, day after freakin' day!!!
horrible connecting to wireless internet  Does anyone else have serious issues with this computer connecting to wireless routers? I want to like this computer but it won't connect with half of the wireless networks I come across. I'm very close to sending it back after wasting hours of my life trying to fix it with no answers found on any of the support forums
Disgusted for what I paid  One year in and it is turning into a brick.  I am having the notorious MSI fan syndrome issue with the left CPU fan.  Disgusted for what I paid.
Absolute Garbage  Worked great for the first week, then died right before my midterm papers were due. It black screened and was completely unable to be reset. I tried every fix my father (an IT director) could find. I wouldnt buy this whatsoever.
came with the mouse problem
Worst computer I ever purchased  This PC had issues from the beginning.  Constant excel, word, chrome not responding.  Worst computer I ever purchased. Can not recommend this computer to anyone.
Nice laptop - Terrible Support  First off, I want to say that I love the look and feel of this laptop. I bought it for it's combination of light-weight, reasonable sized screen (for the weight) and battery capacity (still getting 4-6 hours after several months of heavy battery use).  Unfortunately after about 3 months, I started having problems with it. The main thing being that it wouldn't come back on after sleep mode and also some other minor annoyances such as the buggy touchpad , the numlock goes on at random times, and I have to manually start the wifi everytime I boot up .  I called and phone service was good.. ended up calling a few times and got someone on the line fast each time. Then I sent it back for repair. They honored the warranty and were fine to work with but  I lost my laptop for 3 weeks!  I live on the east coast so it was one week to just get it to them, then they took a whole week to fix it and shipped it back to me UPS ground so it took another week.  Now that I've had the laptop back for a few days I can see that NONE of the problems were fixed.  So in short, I really wanted to like this laptop...it's got a great display, good compact design, it's thin, light and looks great but it broke and the support was terrible...stay away from this one!!
Big Disappointment  Big Disappointment...after 1 week the laptop died and would not boot at all. Asus was good at providing where I should ship the dead laptop but first expected me to pay for the shipping to send it back. What? REALLY? They finally agreed to pay but it has taken nearly 2 weeks to ship it across the country and get it into their repair queue.  I think twice before buying!
Returned it  DIDNT LIKE IT AT ALL
Just plain wrong.  Have had serious problems a month after purchasing this computer.  Hoping to hear back from the company to resolve this issue in my email.  Screen would fade to black, then refuse to come back on after trying a series of different troubleshoots.  Computer battery was a dud, because it would fully charge and only allow me roughly three hours of being able to work on it before having to recharge it after the first month of use.  Now the motor I think has died, because there is no noise at all coming from the motor when I hit the power button, nor will my cooling fan work when plugged into the battery (computer battery powered).  Very unsatisfied with a nine hundred dollar purchase, because my initial shutting down issues started to surface thirty days after I purchased it.
Screen got blank  This laptop got to me non functioning, I charged for about 4hr and I pressed on button it was only the fan running nothing showed on the screen. It was really frustrating....
No Wifi connection after 5 months.  My chromebook worked for first 5 months and then stopped connecting with WIFI. Sent back to ASUS, and they repaired it. Worked for one week and then stopped again. Sent it back second time for repair--just received it and it does not work (same problem). Called them, and I now have to send it back a third time, and they may give me a replacement. The customer service rep I spoke with (who was very nice) was not authorized to send a replacement. Will re-post if they send replacement. At this point would not recommend ASUS chromebook.
Product arrived damage
Soooooo Sloooooooowwwwww!  This is by far the slowest laptop I have ever used!  At 55 years old I have used hundreds of new and used laptops.  This is by far the slooooooooowest ever.  I want to stick a hot stick in my eye!  Do NOT waste your money!
Lots of issues.  Nvidia card has given me all sorts of problems (that the Nvidia folks themselves don't seem to be able to fix.) And the laptop stopped waking up after being put to sleep (yes I've tried everything you can, messed with settings, updated drivers/bios etc, when I try to wake it up it freezes then I have to restart manually every time) ... horrible laptop. Save yourself some time and energy and just build a gaming PC, it's bulky but it's worth it. And go with AMD, the past few Nvidia cards I've had have been absolutely riddled with issues.
No happy.  The computer is very slow to start.  Sometimes it does not start at all.  I have been getting an error message that the system resources are not adequate.  No happy.
Falling apart after warranty  The w530 comes with a 12 month warranty. At 13 months I started having issues - USB 3's and VGA stopped working, crash dumping for no reason, built in mouse freezes constantly, and ever slower startup.  I tried system restore using the built in recovery, but it won't launch. Called Lenovo and they won't provide any assistance since warranty has expired; all they offer is to PURCHASE recovery disks. When I asked to speak with a manager I was denied for not having a current warranty.  While the computer worked well it was nice, but definitely not worth the money long-term. Also, no HDMI port is a huge pain.
Had expectations but was quickly proven otherwise  Initially I had good impressions until I opened the unit and tried to turn it on. Surprisingly, it did not turn on. I tried to troubleshoot by holding the power button but it did not do any good. Finally I tried to connect to the charger and it turns on. However the laptop had almost full charge. This is unacceptable for a laptop to not be able to turn on without connecting it to an outlet. I'm returning this.
this laptop has so bad display. i bough it only for display  this laptop has so bad display. i bough it only for display.  but it is so dark, and noisy. i sell it off at 1000$. i will buy Retina Mac book
From delight to complete hatred in under 60 days  I went from loving this thing to hating it intensely in a very short time.  This review covers the hardware itself, not Chrome OS.  Chrome OS is great, and I think it's a wonderful OS for home use.  In short, if you want a Chromebook, you can find a better device than this one.  The biggest issue I found was that when I opened the lid after 30+ minutes of no use, the machine would turn back on, but the display wouldn't.  For example, if I had been previously listening to music when I closed the lid, the music would come back on, but the display would be totally off, even after opening & closing multiple times, pressing the brightness keys, or tapping the power button quickly.  Each time I would have to force shutdown the device and then power it back on, which was always a very slow startup.  Another major issue was with the power charger.  This device uses a micro USB charger, which at first seems great because hey I have tons of Micro USB cords!  Maybe I could even charge my Chromebook in my car! Right? Wrong.  Unfortunately only the Chromebook's charger will work as normal micro USB chargers (e.g. for phones) are too "low power", as the message that pops up says when I plug it in.  Also, the physical connection itself is flimsy and janky.  Inexplicably, sometimes when I connected the charger the machine simply wouldn't charge... at all, with the indicator light remaining off.  About me: I'm a software developer and I've been using computers since I was 10 years old.
but didn't so will put up with it and hope it becomes more comfortable and serves its purpose for a while  This is cheap and feels cheap.  The keyboard is choppy and unresponsive, the plastic seems flimsy and the left/right click of the touchpad have no separation so always hitting the right side when I want the left.  I wish I would have returned it, but didn't so will put up with it and hope it becomes more comfortable and serves its purpose for a while.  Should have spent more and gotten the one of the brands I have had previously and been happy with.
Not Happy  This computer was great for the 2 months it worked. Bought it on 08-19-2015 and the hard drive died tonight.  Now it has to be sent across the country for repair. It is a far cry from my old toshiba satillite that I bought in 2007 and still works.
poor quality battery and poor quality worksmanship  The laptop works normally and is everything you expect from a low end budget laptop.  however the headphone jack on my laptop is defective and it has not even been 2 months of use. I fear that more things will become broken or defective as time goes on.  I regret not just buying a laptop of better quality to begin with.  In addition to the poor quality of the ports as mentioned above, I am writing this in March of 2015 less than one year after purchasing this laptop. The battery is incapable of holding a charge and needs to be constantly plugged into a power source. The battery is clearly either defective or simply meant to break quickly and render this laptop incapable of functioning normally.  I would strongly suggest looking at another product.
Very poor screen  Overall solid construction, sort of a soft-touch play on the Macbook Pro.  Dell dropped the ball on the screen, however.  The quality of the display is very bad because of poor contrast, poor color rendition and grainy appearance.  The space between pixels is large enough to be seen, and the overall effect is a white halo around black text on light backgrounds. This specific issue with text makes this unusable for me without an external monitor. Excel also looks funny because each box has a white inner and outer border as a result of the screen.  Smaller icons look poor as the pixel dot pitch obscures their detail, and oranges and greens look unnatural due to the poor gamut.  It is the worst monitor I have seen on a laptop since 2002, and I have used many, many laptops.  Bottom line, if you can tell the difference between DVD and VHS (and some people say they can't), this display will drive you absolutely bonkers.
Dell did NOT make E6420 in 2015 as you state in your add. This laptop is at least 2 or 3 years old. Don't be deceitful in listings
Struggling with even basic tasks a week later  I bought this computer about a week ago and I was pretty happy to find how fast it was.  Android studio ran like a dream and I could evem multitask as I worked.  Then about a week in the computer seemed to come off of a high as it now struggles to perform even the most menial of tasks.  It still works but it very frequently lags as I work, to the point that Im currently writing this review on my phone since I don't trust the laptop at all.  Even my old computer (4 yrs old and water damaged) was more reliable than this.  I don't know what else to say, I had really high hopes for this computer and for a time, it delivered.
HP ENVY TouchSmart m7-j020dx Intel Core  This laptop is absolute 'garbage'!  Do not waste your money or time with this machine and Windows 8 that went to Windows 8,1 to fix bugs, only makes this machine worse, so do not upgrade.  I purchased this very same unit brand new directly from HP not even a year ago and it has gone back for service 4 times and then the motherboard went, for the second time. They are sending a replacement which will be a new Windows 7 Professional, so it will be a lot of fun trying to get all of my software loaded and working.  Tech support from HP is someone that Googles the answer while placing you on hold for several minutes and still in most cases will not be able to solve the issue, so customer service is another waste of time.  I've got over 100 documented hours with HP's Tech Support, most of them have no more knowledge than a novice computer user. Windows 8 has been out for a relatively short time and Microsoft is already to roll out Windows 10, so what does that tell you.  Microsoft will keep pumping out new OS's just to keep the money train on track and not taking the time to put together a quality system.  Windows 7 is by far a much better machine, if you are looking for a good machine, sometimes thinking an upgrade is better and in this case it is not, I had the 1TB hard drive and bumped it up to the 16GB of RAM and thought I was getting the latest and greatest and all I had was one problem after another ...... Save yourself a lot of aggravation and don't get this machine ...... if you do, eventually you will be sorry that you did.  The Touchsmart screen and the 'Charms' bar make it sound like a lot of though was put into this machine, however, if I wanted to buy a table, I would have bought a tablet.  So, I downloaded Classic Shell and made the interface look like Windows 7, which to me was an upgrade from what this machine came with.  If I could give this machine a true rating it would be in the negative numbers, terrible product, tech support is sub-par and after spending over $1,300.00 with all the problems this machine has been, I decided to go with a very reliable machine in Windows 7.  I know the Windows 8 lovers will have their input, but after buying brand new, out of the box, having to send this unit back four times (twice in one month) they can keep their Windows 8 and good luck with that.  So, my experience with the Windows 8 nightmare is thankfully over ..... so my advice, don't buy this machine, however, it does make good for target practice.
Had it 11 months and it no longers work.  Had it 11 months and it will no longer turn on. I sent it in under warranty and Gateway says since they saw residue from a spill  on the keyboard (which is true) but it was many months ago and amount was very small. They want $270 to fix it and will not honor warranty. This is my second and last Gateway - Acer product, they always come up with an excuse not to honor the warranty when unit fails within warranty time period. Other unit the hard drive failed after just 3 months and they wanted me to pay for it. I did take laptop apart after they sent it back ( I figured for $270 I would rather buy a new laptop), and power supply failed, which looking on the web is not uncommon and if their techs looked at all it should have been obvious. However I do agree with other reviewers it was a good laptop will it lasted.
A tremendous (and expensive) dissapointment  I adored my last two Mac laptops,  particularly the 13" Air which I had for 4 years and only replaced because it started to feel sluggish.  i bought the 12 inch Macbook thinking I'd adjust to the slightly smaller size, wanting the Retina display, and wanting the portability.  This was a mistake. Absolutely the only thing I like about this computer is that it is easy to carry.  I hate the "only one port,  I don't love the performance, it doesn't sit in my lap well  and I absolutely detest the keyboard.  Seriously the keyboard.  The Air had been the first portable on which I'd typed and not found the cursor jumping from where I wanted to somewhere else on the screen.  Typing on the 12" Macbook brings back all the things I didn't like about typing on laptops and now I hear that they are making this keyboard the standard new design?  UGH.  I keep trying to pretend to myself that i'm going to learn to love this thing, but it isn't happening, and I am afraid I'm going to have to sell it at a loss to buy a machine I like.  I wish I'd returned it when I first got it.
Are you going to buy this? If so,  proceed with caution  I must have gotten a bad laptop because it seems most people with this computer are pretty satisfied. I bought this laptop a few month back. I seldomly browse the net, or even have it connected for that matter, and this computer is freezing up as if I had been porn surfing for 5 days straight. Even the task manager isn't responding. All I want is a computer that I can use for homework, YouTube, and music; is that too much for a guy to ask? Be careful with this one. It seems this brand is a hit or miss.
Perfect for homework for our middle schooler but stopped working after about 8 months but warranty is only for software and they don't fix hardware.  I would have bought insurance but didn't seem to be an option.
Disappointed  When I receive this product in the mail, the charger look like it was disassembled and it will not charge period. The battery was also completely dead, to the point where I had to purchase a new one for the computer to even turn function
Trouble getting it worked on.  Trouble w/warranty.  Still having issues.  Ck back Continuous problems  Dell cannot fix, looking for return for new computer, I think this one is a refurbished one, I bought new.
... one hour to come on to wed site it good but not for work  it run so slow it take one hour to come on to wed site it good but not for work
Just dont.  This WAS the best laptop that I ever owned for 12 months. In January the computer became very sluggish and would not stream video or play a single game no matter how simple. I contacted ASUS for support and they informed me that it would cost $500 to fix. Basically they sold me a lemon that wore out and want me to spend almost the same amount that the CPU cost just to fix it. I am working to fix it myself but this is the last ASUS that will ever be in my home.
I had expected the limited memory but also expected better performance after reading these reviews  I had expected the limited memory but also expected better performance after reading these reviews. The performance is really really slow. Literally opening a web page takes 2 minutes. My Asus UL30 lasted 5 years until a cup of coffee did her in. This is my 3rd Asus and I'm really surprised at the major glitches they let fly. The speakers might as well not exist. There is no volume. Expect to use external speakers. Even worse, the headphones jack also - no volume. It's unbelievable how they could let this happen.  At max volume you still need to turn on subtitles to watch a movie.  There are many useless programs that cannot be uninstalled. Most annoying is "Groove" which they seem to think is an itunes alternative. Huge fail. Every time an update is installed is turns the default from mediaplayer to groove. HATE groove. Also the keypad has many incompatibility issues. Finale (music notation) does not work. I also have a problem with the size of the keypad (too large for the keyboard) that has no defined left/right/ bottom. At the end of the day I need something that gets the job done, and my needs are quite simple. This was a bad purchase for me. I would have sent it back but now I'm in south America and it's too late. Now, just today, it started playing the  a phantom duplicate sound (youtube etc) that precedes the video sound by a few seconds. It can only be stopped with Ctl/Alt/Del. What a mess.
Looks great and works great until you turn it on and actually try to use it.  Very sluggish overall not at all happy with it so far.  Going back to the old fashioned way of shopping.
Won't turn on  It worked great for 3 months then I went to turn it on and it wouldn't. I let it sit for a weekend plugged in and it suddenly turned on again. Worked well for a week, then the same issue. If I ever try to turn it on from powered all the way off, it refuses to turn on again for several days. It's confusing and frustrating and unreliable. I can't use it, and I'm just out the money now. Half the time plugging it in will not light up the battery light (I've used multiple cords, so it's not the charging cable) and the other half the lights do show. There's nothing I can tell for why it does this. A defective product with no help from Amazon to fix or replace.
I received it today, and when after I plugged in the charger and booted it up, the screen was black. The charge light was on and the fan was running but nothing showed on the monitor. I kept it charged and after 30 minutes nothing changed, the screen was still dead.
Had to get 4 laptops before getting a working one.  Not sure how many stars to give this computer.  I am on my 4th one. I got the first from Amazon, and the screen was fuzzy, like it wasn't connected tightly maybe? So I returned it and got #2.  The touchpad didn't work.  Attached a USB mouse and found that the computer knew it should have one, but that it was "disconnected".  I wasn't opening a brand new computer up, so I returned it for #3. #3 got here a day later (Amazon's return shipping was amazing!).  Opened it up, touchpad didn't work, so I sent it back. I was ready to give up, but I figured things happen in 3's so I'd give it one more chance. #4 got here, and the screen was clear, the touchpad worked, and I was ecstatic! After several hours of setting it up, I got to the CD loader, and couldn't get it to open with the button.  It's really cheap, and rarely works.  However, this is easy to work around with using the "eject" button from the main screen. But I should NOT have to have spent a week doing QA for ASUS.  It is ruining their brand name! I guess all PC manufacturers are too busy being cutting edge and don't care about quality anymore. But I've been on the 4th one now for a few days, and I'm happy with the memory and CPU performance. I even figured out win8 (You HAVE to download the "start menu" program from CNET to make it like Windows 7, but it's worth it. All the Microsoft bloatware that comes with Win8 is slow, stupid, and sucks, but that isn't a problem with ASUS. I don't know why someone would want their computer to act like a smartphone, and the emulator to make it such is evidently quite a beast, because it's SLOW to use any Microsoft Windows Appstore apps.  Also, the 1 TB drive is partitioned into 400GB for C: and 600GB for D:.  Not sure why since Windows wants everything on C:, but that's easy to tweak. Another thing to know about this is that the VGA port doesn't have room for the screws that come on most (older maybe?) monitor cables.  So you can either buy a VGA to HDMI adapter and use the HDMI output if you want to dock it, or leave the screws ungrounded, depending on what your cable allows.  Bottom line, if you're willing to play laptop roulette until you get a working one, it's a nice machine to have.  Not sure if the problem belongs to Acer or the Amazon packaging, which wasn't really spectacular.  In fact, the first one they sent me with 4lbs of cat food sitting on top of my laptop. Overall, the PC is good.
Save your money  Worst laptop I have ever owned.  I had to ship it back to toshiba last week due to the hard drive going out.  I had to pay $30 for shipping.  The mouse gets frozen and doesn't move.  You click on anything and it is very delayed.  Don't waste your money on this.  A $530 laptop that seems like it's from 2000 isn't worth it.
Not happy at all  Screen is broken! Sending back for refund! Not happy at all!
Didn't use it for a week went to use it and it won't turn on
WHAT A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!  What a huge disappointment.  This computer is the most expensive (everything's relative) laptop I've ever purchased because I wanted faster speeds, a longer lasting battery, and the larger screen.  I knew I would be getting a laptop that is heavy and not easy to port from place to place.  I settled for the trade-off and got the most memory, the most RAM, the fastest processor available, and the largest battery - promising 5 hours of use on a full charge (all else being equal).  I don't stream much on my computer.  I use it for work (university professor) and personal (web, email) purposes primarily.  First, there is a very unpredictable built in mouse pad that it is impossible to use.  I've been using built in mouse pads for 25 years and this one constantly takes me to places I do not want to go and often have to reboot to exit!  Moreover, I often leave the computer on, and shut the screen to the keyboard when the computer is not in use.  When I go back to use the computer I see a bright white page that does not respond to any commands - by mouse or keyboard.  I inevitably have to restart the computer - which certainly takes away from the benefit of leaving it on with the screen collapsed to the keyboard.  Not only does this require more time, but it sometimes means that documents or emails I've left incomplete are lost... with no return.  I wish I could return this computer.  I know I bought an extended warranty and I don't have a clue how to get any help.  What a disappointment.  I now use, almost always, the older laptop I was going to replace with this one.  It was half the money - also an HP 'beatsaudio' - with a key missing and a loose screen.  Still I prefer it to this new model which has exhausted my patience!!!
Specs good on paper- full of issues  My wife got me one of these- We had to exchange it 4 times (Every time was due to issues with it being shipped with keyboard issues.) It had issues with dead keyboard backlighting, half-dead keyboard backlighting, stuck keys.  We finally got a good one, and the BIOS on these models are bugged.  The toggle for Storage driver mode only lets you select RAID.  You can NOT switch to AHCI.  Because of this.  If you try and install new M.2 SSDs many of them are not recognized by the manufacturer utilities.  For example if you install a samsung 950, Magician and the samsung nvme driver will both say they can't find the drive.  Which means you are stuck with default storage drivers.
Useless offline.  When I have a stable internet connection, this computer works as expected, but the offline capabilities of Chrome OS have been greatly exaggerated.  I wasn't expecting much beyond offline word processing, but it can't even do that reliably.  Files will disappear and reappear at random, and edits are sometimes lost if you close the document before syncing.  I know the computer is intended primarily for online use, but I was expecting more than an shiny black brick offline.
1GB limit!  You can buy memory, but Acer says Not user upgraqdable  Just dumb!  Looks like nice unit, but only 1 GB?  Yes, you can purchase the extra memory, but good luck installing it!  Acer's web site says that it is not user serviceable, and doing so voids the warranty.  A computer that you can not do any upgrades to, insteresting.  But what is really dumb is that Amazon pushes the up-sell for the 2GB memory.  Yes, I know; There is a way to upgrade the memory.  If you completely disassemble the netbook you can do it yourself.  No thanks.
Replaced By Newer 2017 Version With 4gb RAM & 32gb Storage  This was a good basic Chromebook but the new 2017 version is faster and smoother with double the RAM memory, double the storage, for under $200.  The Samsung Chromebook 3 for 2017 with 4gb of RAM memory and 32gb of storage is the best Chromebook for less than $200.  The older version with a tiny 2gb of RAM memory simply can not compare.
Beware! Crap product...  Computer was great, but suddenly, right after one year of the purchase date the motherboard stopped working and now I have a useless usd 1300 laptop... The warranty period is just one year, so take your conclusion.  In addition, the support is terrible lame and useless.  ASUS, NEVER AGAIN.
They sent me the wrong laptop.  Amazon sent me the wrong laptop.  I ordered an Amazon Warehouse laptop, and they sent me the wrong one.  When I tried to replace it with the correct laptop, the laptop was out of stock.  Now that the laptop is in stock, the deadline to replace the laptop has passed so I'm stuck with this laptop, after paying the full price for a better laptop.  BAD FORM AMAZON!!
This was just awful.
This guy is a thief stay clear of his products  This guy is a thief the laptop i recieved had no hard drive no power cord and no windows 8
DO NOT buy  I bought this because I wanted a reliable computer... this is not the one I work as a basic programmer so I needed a good computer This one doesn't save files properly and will randomly shut of without warning while im in the middle of working Plus they won't take it back on the warranty so I'm stuck with this piece of garbage and I'm out a couple hundred dollars I would recommend everyone to stay clear of this computer  it's not worth it It will only give you major problems
This machine is full of viruses and malware before it was even connected to the internet. it is also quite slow - sower than my cell phone! I've lost hours for nothing. Should have returned immediately without loosing the most expensive - time. Avoid.
doesn't work  device lasted four days and got blue screen of death.  rebooted, restored twice.  Two more blue screens of death. before it crashed.  the right click button kept popping off. called asus, sent it in, they never acknowledged reciept, ten days after they recieved it, after numerous calls,they claimed it was fixed and sent it back.  I still have not recieved it.  I should have tried to return it through amazon.  Laptop was purchased for my 14 yr old to start high school with using savings plus his graduation money.
Slowest brand new computer ever  Slowest machine ever. I purchased a new laptop because my  (Sony Vaio).  became slow I've had for five years. This one made me want to revive the Sony speed sucks big time. I was still using Sony just started using HP recently and I'm out of the return window. HP usually is a reliable brand I've always owned HP until I purchased the Sony Bc it was all pink . Beware!!
The cd rom didn't work when I received it
not impressed  Not that excited about this laptop I got it because it has dual graphics right it ran smooth for about a week then slowed way down then the motherboard died and I have yet to find an exact match sold in the us the only ones I find that have the second graphics card are shipped from china from  shady sounding people the touch pad is so sencitive that if my finger gets to close it registers multiple taps just try looking for a la 8331p integrated graphics card and see what you get thats the motherboard model number
Junk software  Just concerning the hardware, this is a 5 star computer. The speakers are loud, the trackpad is big and functional, the battery lasts forever, it's quick and sleek/thin.  Unfortunately, you're also stuck with the software.  I absolutely hated using chrome as my operating system. It's great for browsing the internet, but that's all. Shockwave was constantly crashing when I tried to watch online content, much of which was just unavailable from the start. Google drive is completely worthless at this point, even though it's probably the future. Regardless of your connection, it is literally going to take DAYS for you to copy 10+ gigabytes of information. I couldn't get any external storage device to connect to my USB or SD slot. When they would pop up, I still couldn't view their content....the window just froze. Torrents were a massive hassle, apps are limited in both number and function and most of all, you can't use Google earth!!! Yes, you read that correctly...Google earth is completely unavailable on the Google chrome operating system. It really just feels like an incomplete OS.  Chrome is absolutely horrible. I only needed this laptop for web browsing, light picture editing, small torrents, viewing/editing contents on external hard drive and using google earth...web browsing is the only need that's sufficiently met. I'm sad to be returning this laptop, as I loved the Samsung product by itself. Save yourself the frustration and LIMITED functionality to buy something with a decent operating system.
hard to see, use keyboard  Beware,  this model does not have a back-lit keyboard.  VERY hard to see the keys you are typing unless you have a light on the KB.  For me that equates to typo's,  misspellings and a lot of extra time.  If you are getting up there, like me,  you may want to consider an alternative.
I am not happy with this tablet it is unable to play youtube  I am not happy with this tablet it is unable to play youtube,i will not recommened this tablet to anyone
Do Not Buy Windows 8!!!  Bad OS.  I am not super tech-savvy, so trying to figure out how to get started with windows 8 was way too stressful.  I personally think that 'Start-up' directions should be included.  I am STILL trying to figure out how to load & unload 'apps'.  A computer that is NOT a 'Smart Phone' shouldn't disguise it's self as such.  I still haven't found 'Start> Programs> Delete'.  There was NOTHING wrong with Windows XP.  Windows 8; not Great.  Thanks for hanging me out in the dark.
Be careful if you buy this!  I know theres a lot of 5 star reviews on here, and its a great price, so thats why I bought it. I bought it about 2 weeks before I started college, and when I received the item, not only would it not charge without being plugged in, but the fan was so incredibly loud. I spent an hour on the phone with Apple support trying to fix it, and I even went to the Apple store to see what they could do and they just told me to return it because it wouldnt be worth paying to fix it myself. My return was rather quick, so I thank them for that, but I definitely do not recommend purchasing this.
Stay away from Toshiba  My Toshiba Satellite crashed 5 times within the first year, each time Toshiba states they replaced the hard drive. Spent hours on the phone each time it crashed. On hold and sent from department to department. Never loaded any additional software. Short battery life, keys often have to be hit hard to register the letter you want on the screen. Keys fall off. Now out of warranty I own a worthless nonworking computer. Dont buy Toshiba!
I always liked acers stuff  I bought this laptop a couple years ago. I always liked acers stuff. It has never worked right and is slow as anything. It has led to many hours of frustration as easy tasks take minutes at a time and not responding messages. I had to buy a new screen once cause it caused so much frustration i pinched the screen.
don't waste your money!  I would give this zero stars if I could. I bought the original one for my 6 year old for Christmas. Opened the box, plugged it in, and it wouldn't turn on... Super disappointing. Returned for a replacement. Received replacement and took out of box, plugged in and it turned on! All was well until a half hour later when my son said it turned off. It was plugged in and had 75 percent on the battery so I figured he accidentally hit the button. Turned it back on and let him play again. Five minutes later it turns off again. I turned it back on and went into the game myself. Did it again. Searched for a solution on Google. Found a forum with a mike long thread on this issue. Shut down in the middle of reading that. Let my son play again and 3 minutes later it shut down. Returning for refund this time!
Do not buy from this company  Our tablet pc arrived in a timely manner but shortly there after the hard drive locked up. Returned pc as instructed and haven't heard from them, except poorly worded emails.  no answer on supplied telephone no.  Completely dissatisfied
Side split completly apart, and within 7 months not working at all.  Not very good quality. Side broke apart soon after we got it and within 7 months is completely split down the entire side and now not working at all.
DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!  I had nothing but problems with this computer, and I would NEVER buy another SONY product after how I was treated by SONY! My Laptop got so HOT that I burnt my forearm on it, and when I called SONY, their response was... Seek an Attorney. THE NERVE! I paid 1,500.00 gor GARBAGE. it was serviced previously, and only got worse. TOO MANY PROBLEMS TO MENTION, but to add insult to injury... They wanted almost $800.00 to repair it. Yeah, and did they think I was some dummy who would pay that? I would TRASH IT FIRST! SONY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES! WARNING!!!!!! Do Not buy their Laptops!!! I know other people who have purchased different models of their Laptops, and they are all having issues or had issues with them!
My First Lenovo  I bought the Lenovo because of the newer AMD processor and 4GB RAM.  I have owned Gateway, Acer, Dell, and Toshiba laptops over the last 10 years.  I hate this Lenovo and will be looking for a new laptop in next few weeks.  Will give this one to my grand kids to play games on.  First, the touchpad is so sensitive that even as I was writing this review, I touched somewhere and the entire page jumped so low I had to recover with the mouse back to the text area.  I truly hate it.  Additionally, the touchpad is positioned so far to the left, you almost always have your hand on the right side of touchpad and it will go wild when touched on the right side.  Second, Lenovo suggests they have a fast boot optimizer.  Oh well, some mornings it takes it about 4 minutes to actually show anything on the screen.  Worst boot time I have ever experienced.  And yes, I have run their optimizer many times.  Third, when I use a browser, even with all the RAM, the hard drive spins like crazy and you can not move up or down the page until all 'ads' are fully loaded.  The mouse just stays in a spin status until the ads fully load up.  I have tried it with Explore, Chrome, and Foxfire.  All do the same.  Very disgusting!  Never experienced this before on any laptop, netbook, or tablet that I have owned.  That's enough!  If you love the machine and want to buy it cheap, let me know.  I am not a novice at this as I have an Acer and Gateway laptop now along with an IPad and HP Touchpad.  Nothing performs as poor as this machine.  Hope you do better if you get one!
build quality if horrible, completely falling apart  Absolute piece of trash, build quality if horrible, completely falling apart, and now that I've had it for a year the battery lasts maybe 2 hours...
Worst computer I've ever purchased  Been using this laptop for about 4 months now mainly as a school computer and I don't have many complaints.  Small and lightweight -- perfect for toting it around.  Plenty fast for everything I use it for. So far my biggest complaints are: 1.) Track pad.  Like everyone else pointed out, it sucks. It's loud and doesn't glide smooth, especially with any moisture on your fingers.  2.) Weak wifi connection.  I don't know if this is a widespread issue because I haven't seen a lot of other people mention this problem, but my computer cuts in and out or simply won't connect at all, even when I'm on a wifi with a strong signal that all other electronics in my household will connect just fine to.  *4/18/18 update* -- Would NOT recommend purchasing this computer!!  Since my original review more problems have popped up,  which have essentially rendered it non-functional without several adapters.  1.)  By the time this computer was 1 year old, it's ability to connect to WiFi had completely failed without the use of an adapter. I purchased one that plugs into the USB port which has allowed me to connect only when I have it plugged in. 2.)  By two years,  the track pad completely stopped working.  It won't scroll, click...  Nothing.  I've usually used a mouse anyway,  but now have no choice but to use one. 3.)  Between the adapter and the wireless mouse,  I am now down to one out of three USB ports that I am able to utilize.  Bottom line...  This computer has been a total piece of garbage. I can't wait to see what function stops working next!
This computer has lots of problems, had to send it twice for warranty.
not really happy with this  not really happy with this. very slow. I should have spent extra and bought a laptop. I'll know next time.
Decent Laptop  edit: PLEASE STAY AWAY from this laptop and ALL DELL laptops for that matter. Dell is an terrible company with abhorrent customer service. My laptop finally died for good last night. I was using it and planning on updating it as I am about to start school soon again. Next thing I know the thing shuts off randomly and a burning smell fills the air. If you have the extra money, I recommend something like the Razer Blade instead or at least something with a warranty lasting longer than a year.  Before all of that, my laptop was suffering from several problems. They were: the infamous loose side hinge coming off, unresponsive keyboard and purple smudges on the led screen were something I had to deal with daily. You've been warned.  old: Crappy laptop. Keyboard doesnt respond sometimes and so I have to crtl alt delete to get it working. The hinges on the left side came out of nowhere. There's some weird purple tint on the bottom left corner of my screen. Bare in mind I don't really use this laptop so all these problems shouldnt be happening. I wish I could get a refund but it is too late for me.  *Battery is average *Keyboard is average *Laptop is sometimes unresponsive and I have to ctrl-alt-delete and click cancel for it to be responsive again * Speakers are fine - turn off the "enhancement" in Dell Audio for best sound quality Although this is a 'gaming laptop' I am using this strictly for school so I can't comment on the laptop's performance, gaming wise.
Junk refurbished (certified?)  Bought 3 refurb for my employees to be backup laptops.  Don't know what company did the 'work' on these.  All 3 had about 1hr of battery life after a 20hr charge. 1 had the video card or the monitor going out almost immediately. 1 was missing the little window for charging and power on over the little LEDs.  1 even had a pink sticky over the user person camera that they didn't catch.  All 3 looked like they were tossed out of a moving vehicle.  These weren't refurbished, they should have been sold as 'well used'.  These are certified refurbished?  What company would admit to cleaning these up?  Obviously terrible quality control
Disappointed with application scaling to this high resolution  My previous laptop is a Samsung series 9 15 inch from about two years ago. I loved it so much I figured I would upgrade to more current model. I was really looking forward to the improvement in the screen resolution. The resolution is impressive when looking at a picture or a movie, but most applications are not scaling well. Even Microsoft office applications are not fully designed to deal with the high resolution. Even when I reduce the resolution to standard HD levels most applications are having issues. For example, in MS Outlook, I bring up the "advanced find" screen to do a search in my email, the search window that pops up is not designed with a scroll bar. The window does not show all of its contents and there is no way of scrolling down to see all the fields in that window. I cannot do an advanced search in outlook as a result! Another example would be QuickBooks 2013 . The "home" screen that normally shows a diagram shows nothing. QuickBooks is not able to render the home screen diagram! all the menus are crunched up top of the screen so small, it is hard to use. some pop up window inside quickbooks come up soooo small you can harly read or click in them. You have to take a guess and hope it works. "date" dropdowns in quickbooks do not function properly. The large rectangle that is supposed to open up for you to select a date shows up a garbled up characters because of the high resolution, you cannot select a date, you can only type it.  Photoshop lightroom 5 is one of the best apps that scale. Not much of a resolution issue there. But 8 gigs of ram make photoshop lightroom a little slow and make it lag at times.  External monitor shifts are also not smooth. I have a full HD 27inch monitor for image editing. when I move an app from the laptop monitor to the external monitor the scaling shift is huge. even Internet explorer does not scale well leaving the menu bar and tab names disproportionately huge.  Overall, I am not very happy. I don't think this laptop brought any improvements to my workspace over its predecessor, the 2 year old 15inch version. I am seriously considering returning it, if they take it back...
For these reason I would not recommend this product  Computer, when running, runs well. It is fast, sleek and very responsive. I had issues right away with the computer shutting itself down, especially when going into sleep, then not turning back on properly. ASUS has tried to blame it on an external software issue but the problem started before much of my software was loaded. Now I get a blue screen with kernel_data_inpage_error almost once a day (after 3 months of having my computer). It is frustrating when I paid quite a bit of money for my computer and expected more from ASUS. From forums this issue seems to be a consistent problem with ASUS machines and there does not seem to be a permanent fix. For these reasons I would not recommend this product, which is sad as it is otherwise a great machine.
The battery doesn't work one year and one month after purchase, and is not replaceable  The battery doesn't work after one year. The battery says 0 percent and will not charge. The batter is not easy to purchase and replace like PCs usually are. The laptop is pretty much useless.
Do Not Buy  Not an adequate laptop at all, and I expected something good for spending about twice what I did for my last laptop. My first experience was being sent a broken unit. It's replacement - not much better. This laptop is SLOW.  Loads websites at half the speed my 5 year old HP does, and is laggy, buggy no matter what browser you use. The video processing is very slow.  Don't try to play a game or watch something on Netflix. The screen blacks out.  Or has a frozen portion that is unresponsive to mouse. The laptop freezes several times a day. In the 12 days or so I had it, it crashed about 5 times. Returned on the 12th day of possession. I will never buy Asus again.
Critical Review: Every Detail You Need to Know  UPDATE May 2, 2015: Keyboard has stopped working. I have dropped the review from a 5 star to a 2 star. I will be returning this chromebook, scroll below for more details.  I shall begin by stating what a Chromebook is and what it isn't.  What it is: A chromebook is a laptop with a online web based operating system. Meaning it is highly dependent upon an internet connection. This however should not be a turn off for multiple reasons:  1. You can work offline. So yes, you can indeed do things such as write documents, make spreadsheets, edit photos and even listen to music(the music being located on your harddrive). Your documents and everything else will be synced to the cloud the next time you're connected to the Internet.  2. This shouldn't be too much of a factor since we live in a day and age where we are surrounded by wifi in every corner. Even in the rare case that you do not have internet, you can do as much as you would on a regular laptop with no internet. There is no real difference. So don't let that be too much of a factor in your decision making.  What it isn't: The chromebook is just one beautifully designed browser so to speak and because of this, there are some limitations as to what a chromebook can do. Think of a chromebook as a container and all it can run is a web browser. If its on the web, you can run it on the chromebook, if it isn't then you can't.  Here is an example. If you have the youtube app and select it, it will just open up the chrome browser and load the youtube page. Apps essentially are just shortcuts to their web pages. So again, if you select the google docs icon at the bottom of the screen, it will open up the browser and load the web page for google docs. Since it really is all cloud based, you can not really install "software" like you would on a normal PC. You can download apps from the Google Chrome Store. Notice how I said Chrome Store and not Play Store. These are apps made for the chrome browser and not apps made for mobile phones; so don't expect a phone app to be compatible on the chrome browser.  Another limitation is the hardware. Because this is a cloud based operating system, you can not install complex software such as photoshop. Adobe however has announced that they are working on a beta to work on chromebooks. That being said, photoshop, in order to work, will have to be on the cloud. In conclusion: If the software doesn't run in a browser, then you can't have it on a chromebook.  Review Criteria: So now onto the actual product review. I am reviewing this product based on its capabilities as a chromebook. I will not be reviewing it compared to regular laptops. If i did compare it to a regular laptop, the laptop would win because of its ability to process and install software. Keep in mind however this can vary depending what you intend on using the laptop for.  Operating System: This computer is intended on easy use. Things such as writing documents, surfing the web, watching videos, and having online web sessions. Everything is integrated with your Gmail account. This is great because if someone else wanted to use your laptop, they would log in with their own gmail account and it would preload all their preferences, bookmarks and documents. The operating system is sleek and  you can tell that google spent a lot of time on researching the best way to make the operating system simple and efficient.  You can't use software such as microsoft word since it is not featured within the Google Chrome Store, however you can edit word files using google docs and google drive. Note that if you did not save these files physically within your laptop, it may take a few seconds to load the document if it is long since it requires an online connection. I do recommend saving documents physically onto the laptop because the files are only a few kb's and you have 16GB worth of space on your SSD, so theoretically you can store thousands of documents on your laptop which is more then enough. I also suggest this so that you may work on existing documents while offline. You can do many thing such as change your profile picture and wallpaper of the desktop. Its like any operating system except everything is done within the Google Chrome Browser. You can click the full screen key to make it seem like a full window and get rid of that browser feeling. A highlight of it being on the cloud is the "built-in" antivirus. Since you really don't have a real hard drive it would be very rare to acquire a virus on this laptop. Just one of the perks of being a cloud based OS.  Hardware: One of my favorite features is it doesn't have a fan! No more annoying little sounds in the background and over heating. I read a lot of complaints about the screen quality and I have to say the screen is good. Its not crystal clear, but it does the job and displays things at full resolution. As for the complaints about it being too dim, it has keys to adjust the brightness level which actually is more then enough. Don't forget, that this laptop is less then $300 so don't expect an insane crystal clear resolution. The speakers are of nice quality as any laptop would be, and since it has a Solid State Drive (SSD) it is much faster at processing then a regular HDD. It takes about a second to turn off and on. The laptop is made of a quality build and certainly does not look cheap. I have only had the laptop for only a day and have already received compliments. It is very light weight for a 14" inch screen compared to other ones within the market. The built in web cam isn't bad, but it isn't the greatest either. It tends to have a lot of static however and appears pixelated. Not amazing, but it gets it job done for video convos. I would give the camera a 3/5. The trackpad is very responsive, nice looking and appears to be made of strong material. The keyboard on the other hand looks nice, however feels somewhat cheap when you run your hands over it. When I press a key it doesn't feel "solid" enough. They feel thin. The keyboard would receive a 3.5/5. This model comes with 3 USB ports. (One of them being USB 3.0 and the other two are just 2.0). It also comes with an HDMI port and a MICRO SD port. It does not however come with a regular SD port, so you won't be able to plug in your regular SD chip to view all your pictures from a camera. Instead, you would have to most likely plug it in through the USB port. Another interesting thing is that the laptop has no battery. So essentially if the laptop battery over time gets poor, you won't be able to replace it, without opening it up. That shouldn't be too much of an issue since most likely by that time you will buy a newer model. So in conclusion, cosmetic wise the laptop receives a 5/5. It looks beautiful, but for the physical hardware I would rate it a 4.2/5 because of things such as the webcam, keyboard and lack of a regular SD port.  One important thing that I did not mention is the size of the charger. It is very short, small and appears to be cheaply built. That would be my only complaint to HP: to make better and longer chargers.  Compared to other Chromebooks this is one of the best and that is why it receives a 5. I would give it a 4.6 but amazon only allows whole numbers. At less then $300 dollars, this is an amazing laptop for everyday use such as going to cafe's and taking notes in class. If you need a computer to do complex tasks such as editing videos and programming, then this is not the computer for you. If its the other way around, I would highly recommend it because it really does do all that you need and it is very light.  December 8, 2014 UPDATE: I have had this for over a week now, and I still love my Chromebook. I do stand firm with this being the best 14 inch Chromebook currently in the market. As for the battery life I was surprised that it can last more than 8 hours. Last night I watched movies for over 5 hours, and surprisingly the Chromebook still had 5 remaining hours of charge left. As for those reviews about the screen quality, yes it is a drawback in a sense, but like I said before, the quality is better than the other 14 inch Chromebooks available. It is also due to the screen that it consumes less battery, and you have to acknowledge that you paid less then $300 for. So until development of better quality screens for lower costs are developed, the HP Chromebook 14, compared to other chromebooks within the market,is the best. I still hold firm to my 4.6 rating of this product.  May 2, 2015 UPDATE: Do not purchase this unless you only are going to use it for just 6 months. After 5-6 months it looks like I will have to be returning this because this is unacceptable. I've been meaning to post earlier about the quality of the base but never got to it until yesterday where half my keyboard failed. The computer is so thin that you can tell there is lots of empty space within the base of the computer where the keyboard is located. Because of that, the computer base can easily bend inward or outward because it is not DURABLE enough. Because it is so thin and durable, half the keyboard has stopped working. Those include the "Y, H, N, U, J, K, M" keys. They are just not making any contact when you press those keys unless you punch them down. I am actually using my other laptop to this this because the chromebook is unusable without those keys. I had a very enjoyable experience but because of its poor physical design and short duration use, I will have to give this a 2 star rating. If you are reading this HP, please focus on creating a more durable base that is not so elastic. I took great caution and care with this laptop, yet it still failed. Very unfortunate.
Essentially useless  So, I got this computer because it was cheep thinking that it would be a good computer considering it was by google and samsung. It was probably the worst computer I've ever owned. It feels like your playing with a kids computer because it's made out of cheep plastic. It's not sturdy at all, it's bended easily. Also the fact that it's useless without internet connection is really impractical.
It is not FULL HD Laptop!  I bought this laptop couple of days ago and after switching it on, I see pixels very well. I was very dissapointed and what is very important, I opened internet based resolution tests and it tells me 1580x860 than 1920x1080 (FULL HD)  It might be a problem of matrix. My 2008 model sony vaio is more crips in terms of the display than this one.
Dont waste you money  had to return because it would not load programs, decided to spend the extra $100 and get the Lenovo Yoga 2, less memory but solid state drive and 10x better quality computer than this
came with a virus  Not pleased at all
Typing this from my PHONE instead of my brand-new, expensive LAPTOP  My laptop must have instinctively known that I was seconds from leaving a negative review as the entire screen just went black.  It'll start with the logo and then refuse to reboot.  But, hey, I most likely would have ended up on my phone anyways if I wanted to sustain any sort of internet connectivity longer than ten minutes.  DO NOT BUY.  Apart from everything going black and not working on a less than a month old computer, I have had problems with this laptop the second it came out of the box.  After about ten minutes, it will randomly disconnect me from the internet.  I will be sitting adjacent to my old Sony Vaio that will not even have a blip in connectivity.  I would like Acer or Intel to explain to me why a FIVE-YEAR-OLD laptop, on its deathbed with technology from FIVE YEARS AGO runs and works better than their brand new one straight out of the box.  Call me crazy, but when I open a new and expensive piece of technology, I expect it to function.  After doing light research (just read the other reviews even), I discovered this problem is not unique to the one I unboxed and quite common.  This is just pure laziness on Acer's part.  They couldn't have tested it and worked out these issues so when the customer buys, it works???  I've tried doing the troubleshoot with Acer, downloading drivers, reverting back to old ones, uninstalling macafee, and all the other problem shooting suggestions out there with this model.  None of them create an actual functioning device.  DO NOT UPGRADE TO WINDOWS 8.1.  Silly me, when an update came up and I clicked on it BECAUSE MY COMPUTER AND PROGRAM SAID IT WAS A HELPFUL THING TO DO. I lost all internet connectivity altogether.  After being on my phone researching, I discovered I had to revert the driver back to windows 8 to get ANY sort of connection.  And, hoping this is not true as my 3 week old computer is now unresponsive and completely black, but read a review that said downloading Windows 8.1 voids the warranty.  There are so many things wrong and criminal about the last five words of that sentence that I can't even right now...  Nope, can't...  Another thing that is just sheer laziness on Acer's part is that the power cord does not even connect to the laptop itself.  It is so bad, if you lift your computer sideways, the whole cord could just fall out.  If it's on your lap and you so much as breathe in it will disconnect.  Breathe out, it will reconnect.  All while beeping at you each time it connects and reconnects if you dare to keep the sound on.  I read the reviews about this and did not think it would bother me... but... it is pretty bad... and more so just annoying that multiple people would approve an expensive laptop to be sold with this really dumb and easily fixable problem. Not impressed with Acer.  I have spent months searching for a computer.  Wifi that is not consistent is not even an option.  I travel internationally and for safety and other reasons like Skype need a laptop that can connect anywhere, and, surprise, function.  I finally settled on this one because I assumed you would not get rooky kinks on an expensive and heavily promoted model.  I bought this model because I thought  it would be trustworthy and reliable.  I was wrong.  There is nothing more I hate than warranties, returning a laptop, and trying to find a new one.  I have spent three weeks hoping that I could find a solution with drivers and what-not with the internet. No fix.  Been ignoring it and now my screen is randomly black.  I have spent hours personalizing and downloading programs to get my laptop setup, it is a nightmare to have to return it.  I don't even know what the warranty is as I never expected to take it back.  Fortunately, from the good reviews of Amazon, I only buy expensive products through them from their customer service.  From what I've discovered, Acer has released a faulty product not ready for consumers and refuses to address the issue.  As well as the Intel internet cards installed with them have a series of problems that warrant them to be recalled.  If they were recalled, I'd keep this laptop (assuming it's not dead right now).  But as much as I really don't want to go through the headaches of returns and warranties, the fact of the issue is: I can't have an over thousand dollar paperweight.  With a thousand dollar piece of technology, I should not be attempting to write this review on my phone right now.
This is a very basic and outdated laptop. Yes it has wifi, but LOOK to see if there is a cd/dvd rom in it because mine does not have one. There is no power cords and the battery on one will not hold a charge for more than 20 minutes. If you use software like skype--NEGATIVE, if you go to Ashford University and think you are going to use safari--NEGATIVE. Look before you buy... its not upgradable and I ended up spending another 120 bucks to get my kids to a level that they didn't hate me or getting this for them... lol. other than that... WORKS GREAT!
This laptop is the absolute worst. DO NOT WASTE YOUR COINS!!
Dont buy this.  Horrible battery life. Full of glitches. Its crap.
UPDATING NOW..3 WARNINGS..and you best read these  First - my first review was "WOULD NOT PRINT TO your wifi printers"...NOw it does SORT of.(3 days later..anbd endless work work work and chat chat caht) It is not easy. You must use another PC/:Laptop as a hOST.LOGGED into the CHROME ACCOUNT to print ..but the print still is F**ked..up. EPSON and BROTHER!  SECOND...you may think you can get 100GB google cloud drive..but you will be denied! (WHY?..lord knows)..THIRD...if you think you can just plug in a flash drive to access your pictures..FORGET ABOUT THAT..it is SOOOOOOOOO SLOW..you..will just DIE.. ..and over all..SAMSUNG SUPPORT is also SOOOO SLOW and so worthless......I AM SORRY I destroyed the boxes for this..I WOULD RETURN IT !!I should of bought my wife another new PC.  This is a HORROR
Flicker screen issue on the most DELL XPS series, be aware!  I'm network engineer and very fan of Lenovo laptops, nevertheless I found this specific model of Dell (XPS13 2016 version) for my wife, but since the beginning of usage we noticed a random screen flickering. After a lot of drivers upgrades I realized in several Dell forums (even in Dell site!) this is a common bug since previous Dell XPS models also!  The screen flickering seems to be associated to a bad manufacturing issues of the output screen chipset and wifi circuit, Dell support is aware about some bad manufacturing practices of their latest Dell XPS models (about 100.000 units using the same motherboard used for all versions of XPS), so you could have the risk to have one of those failed ones.  Several users have reported the flicker not just happen with the laptop screen but with external monitors through hdmi output port, that confirms the hardware issues on the motherboard circuit.  The worst thing is Dell web-based diagnostic tool says everything is ok with the hardware components (reported by Dell users and me also).  I really do not suggest to buy this laptop because you have some % of probability to own a failed laptop.
broken keyboard
Please do NOT purchase  This notebook is beautiful and I wanted very much to love it. I felt it was the perfect combination of function and style and I was willing to pay more for it than other comparable notebooks. The first one I received was defective right out of the box with an error message that read "cooling fan is not operating correctly," and proceeding to shut down automatically. HP's online support was great and offered to repair the notebook and pay for shipping both ways.  Since the notebook was brand new, I opted to replace it with a new one from the seller. I totally understand that there are duds in every make and model, so it was not an issue for me to wait for a replacement.  I received my replacement notebook and waited with bated breath as it booted up. It made it to Windows. Time to celebrate right? Not quite. Four days later as I plugged the notebook in, there was a spark, pop, and smoke. My laptop's power port and the adapter cord suffered scorch marks. I couldn't believe it. I hopped on to HP's chat support again(from another computer) and asked if they could take my notebook in for repair. The rep advised that they would send me a new adapter instead. Only if that didn't work, would they take my notebook for repair. A few days later I received a new adapter and attempted to plug it in. Spark, pop, and smoke. I hopped back on with the chat support folks and the rep agreed that they would take the notebook in for repair.  I waited for the empty box and then shipped it out.  Today, I received a call from HP and they advised that they fixed my DC port but the motherboard connector is damaged and that is going to cost me $200+ to repair since it's not covered by the warranty. Just to be clear, an internal part of the brand new replacement notebook (a part that I cannot access without voiding the warranty) is not covered for repair. It's been a month since I first ordered this HP Envy 14 and it's been an incredible waste of time dealing with this. I am now the proud owner of a defective $1000+ notebook.  If you value your time and money. Please do not purchase this notebook.
mine came preinstalled as an ACER seems legit.. returning now hopefully find something that works somehow the price of this has gone up since i purchased it.
This laptop is not good. It handles graphics well  This laptop is not good.  It handles graphics well, but it just doesn't hold up quality wise.  I've had mine a little over a year now and the shift key no longer works, the battery doesn't last but about 30 minutes before it requires charging and it seems the heat from within the unit has caused the plastic to separate under neath it.  Plus sometimes my touch pad shows me ads and that pisses me off.  Don't buy this.  Buy something else.
Have to buy a new battery!!!  This had windows 8.1 installed invalidating the product key. It won't charge, so I am getting a new battery ($60) installed for it. Just really upset, and since I got it in October it's too late to send it back.
One bad apple.....  I've had about 8 Dell laptops over the past 20 years and always been very happy with them.  This one was a dud.  Within 24 hours of booting it up for the first time, it crashed half a dozen times.  I tried everything including resetting it to factory settings, but it wouldn't even boot up after that.  I sent it back!
Crappy refurb.  Will be returning my unit. Paint peeling off the keyboard, defects around the screen. Irresponsible to sell in this state.
Ignore the hype, though I like Google products, this is not ready for prime time  First let me say that I was excited about this product, and really wanted to like it... So much so, that I blinded myself to a lot of the negative feedback on the web regarding lack of regular apps. I figured that 90% of the time I spend on a computer is on the internet, so who cares if occasionally there is some friction regarding desktop applications, right?  Well it turns out that there are still some basic issues Google needs to work out with ChromeOS.  1) Bluetooth - The chromebook 550 doesn't have native bluetooth hardware, but with a bluetooth dongle the chromebook should be able to pair to all sorts of bluetooth devices.  Unfortunately, at the time of this writing (Dec. 2012), Chrome OS only supports bluetooth for a mouse and wireless keyboard.  No audio for bluetooth speakers, no voice / headset capabilities.  For me, this is a major FAIL as the chromebook was marketed as bluetooth compatible.  Again, I'm aware it doesn't come with the native hardware, but it should work with a bluetooth dongle, and this criticism is equally true for the ARM chromebook as well that does come with the native bluetooth hardware - no audio streaming capabilities.  2) Dual Display - As of the time of this writing, the chromebook doesn't support dual monitor setups... Also a major disappointment when I first tried to set this up.  3) Although it was clearly advertised - and this is entirely my own fault - not having standard windows apps is more of a pain in the ass than you might imagine.  I can't connect my scanner to the laptop (something I didn't think about at the time of purchase)... Supposedly there is some google cloud printing that will work with might work with my printer, but I can almost guarantee that printing is not as simple as clicking 'print' in the top left corner of the screen as I am accustomed to.  Google Docs, while fine for READING office documents, is not quite as functional at WRITING office documents.  The spreadsheet - while ok - is nowhere near as good as Excel.  Once you've learned Office, (and you still use it in the context of work, or because other people send Office docs), it really isn't worth it to relearn all of the shortcuts and tools of the google versions of Office.  This may seem like griping, but are all manners of formulas, filters, etc. in Excel that I use that I would have to relearn in Google Docs... not worth it for the time being.  The other area where the standard apps are needed is for general media.  For music, no spotify, no sonos, pandora works (because its web accessible), but no bluetooth to transmit to hardware.  The display port is some strange format that requires special adapter cables to connect to HDMI / DVI /  VGA displays... Not sure why they didn't just make this with a standard display port in the first place, and again as I mentioned - no dual display mode.  Many review are correct to point out that this is basically a laptop with the chrome web browser only.  That's basically the experience you get on the chromebook. On a positive note, it does feel like a web browser on steroids though.  You won't notice the under-powered Celeron processor b/c there is no background Windows bloat.  Side by side with a newer i7 laptop, I haven't noticed any actual performance differences surfing the web - and I generally tend to browse with 15+ tabs open at a time.  Booting in 10 seconds is great.  I can see why many people claim in reviews that it has become their go-to laptop.  It's addictive to not have to wait to get on the internet, but the novelty wears off once you realize all of the limitations of the chromebook.  Side by side with a $600 laptop, it's still very difficult to justify the purchase.  For only $150 more, I can get a dual core 3rd gen i5 CPU.  6gb of ram.  500 gb hard drive (I'll give the chromebook the advantage of an SSD, but still the windows laptop has 500gb of local storage that you'd otherwise have to pay extra  for online), BLUETOOTH, dual display capabilities, the ability to use just about any program / application I feel like, AND I can still use the chrome web browser with 15+ tabs open, and store whatever I like in the cloud if I feel inclined to do so.  The only drawback I can think of to the slightly more expensive windows laptop is the boot-time, and maybe the added possibility of getting malware.  I plan to return my chromebook in the near future.  All this being said, I would take a look at a chromebook again in a couple of years.  In subsequent OS releases - which are released every 6 weeks or so, and transmitted via internet - they plan to add bluetooth & dual monitor capabilities (though I'm not willing to twiddle my thumbs and wait).  I also think the google app store will fill out a bit with time.  After filling in the glaring oversights, google still needs to focus on some kind of windows emulator that can interface with printers / scanners / cameras / mobile phones and other hardware.  Also a real competitor to microsoft office is needed.  The Google Docs are not quite there yet, though they are ok for very basic work like taking notes during a web browsing session.  If they can nail hardware and an Office suite, they could really have a platform that people would develop software for.  Until all of these gaps fill in though, its just not worth all of the work-arounds necessary to make the chromebook a serviceable laptop.  And it's hard to justify this as a '2nd' computer, when I can get a significantly improved '2nd' computer for only $150 more.  Not recommended at this time.
I check all my phones for the connections and they are fine. Etc  I have used the computer a few times and it slow and cannot keep up w movies. It loses signals all the time. I check all my phones for the connections and they are fine. Etc. I was disappointed to say the least.
A laptop should last longer than 12 months!!!  This laptop died exactly one year after purchase. I don't recommend this product.
BAD EXPERIENCE  I got a defective piece that doesn't even power on. I have charged it for more than 10 hrs and it still doesn't power on. I called up Asus and they have asked me to ship it back to them.
Scratches, VERY slow, returning soon  My last MacBook was refurbished as well, in perfect condition and ran like new - I guess I got lucky? This one is exactly not that... runs very, very slow. Did not need a password to log into computer but to edit any settings I need the password??? Obviously an older model, which didn't bother me but the outside is pretty noticeably scratched, on top & bottom. Power cord is slightly damaged as well, but works. Definitely going to return
Totally useless  I brought one several weeks ago, and it really sucks! You have to connect to a wired network, or else, it can do nothing. I know people love google, I love google too, but I have to say, this product sucks.
OK with flaws for the first year; keeps dying below 60% battery  This sleek shiny model was an early Christmas present in 2014. The portability, clear display, physical keyboard (with keys), and transformer capabilities kept me pleased during the initial honeymoon period of about 6 months. I have now used this machine for nearly two years and I am sorry to say it has not held up, particularly in regard to power/battery.  Some flaws I noticed right off the bat, and tolerated: - Extremely short charging cable and proprietary charger: though it charges via micro USB, it only works with the included ASUS charger, whose cord is less than 3 feet long. The good news is that it does work with a USB extender cable. - Slow charging: if it's charging while I'm using it, the battery percentage creeps up at a rate of about 1% per hour. This is not good. - Touch-pad and touch-screen do not always work after detaching/reattaching dock: one of the biggest selling points of this machine is the ability to switch between laptop and tablet mode. But if I detach the dock, the touch-screen doesn't always work, thus defeating the tablet capability. Likewise, if I re-attach the dock, sometimes neither the touch-pad nor my USB mouse works. This problem happens about half the time and is fixed by restarting, but is still a pain.  Now...the IRREDEEMABLE problem. After about 15 months (outside the 1-year warranty), the computer started dying between 50-60% battery. It has now happened many times, in various ways: - It would be working fine, sleep, then not wake up until it was connected to a power outlet. - It would show the "blue screen of death," restart, launch auto-repair, blue screen again, repeat. - The screen would suddenly be covered by crazy pixels (identical to the picture posted by a fellow reviewer) until I forced it to shut down by manually pressing and holding the power button.  The only positive was that this happened predictably, so I would carry the charger around and plug in as soon as it hit below 70% just to be safe. A quick online search revealed that numerous users have reported similar problems. What's the point of a highly portable computer that has to be glued to the power outlet? This is just a bad product. I have tolerated these problems for months, but am finally getting a new computer this holiday season.
Too old, won't run You Tube Videos - get a newer model.
Don't purchase  Not happy with this laptop, slow to load,  i have to constantly shut down. Only good for storage which you can find cheaper... would not but again.
dont buy this  Quit charging within 6 months of use.  now it is completely useless.  Can't find any way to repair it so now it is a brick.  What a joke
Can't upgrade to windows 10  This computer has solid performance, especially with the SSD I put in mine but is not on the list of approved devices for a windows 10  upgrade. Tech support for Toshiba confirms that it cannot be updated to Windows 10, and there are no plans to make it up-gradable. Be happy with windows 8.1, because that's what you're stuck with.
It lasted for 4 months and died. By 'died' is meant the bios updated and refused to reboot the machine. It was a window's 7 OS which is not all that unusual in the scheme of planned obsolescence. Still lost a couple of days work and months of productivity searching for a replacement.
no more vaio!  This is the 3rd vaio I have purchased. It will also be the last. After refusing to accept the preinstalled OS (ms' Edsil pos) I found Sony did not include the correct drivers for XP. So after much time searching the internet, I found the info on how to add the drivers with an existing XP disk to make a workable copy of the preferred OS. Enter vaio #3... I purchased in Dec 2011. In May this year I purchased a Corsair 240gb SSD because of the extreme gains in boot & processing time. Only Sony doesn't supply SSD drivers for this laptop. So, enough is enough.... No more vaio!!
Product does not come with 1 year warrenty  Bought this product in April 2016 with an understanding that it has one year warranty. But when I checked on the Lonovo site for warranty it says the warranty expired in  July 2016. I have developed bad sector and system cannot boot.
It's okay and working well but we we're expecting a Windows xp, it came with 7. Misleading description.
RIP C710 Chromebook  This is barely a year old and is dead. The Chromebook won't charge. A quick internet search shows a lot of people with dead C710 Acer Chromebooks.  Acer is not offering any solutions for this problem. I will not be buying from them again.
On the second month of use it started to give  problem  I received the computer in late March 2018. The computer arrived fast, well packaged, looked brand new, in great condition, looked like no one had used it. The first month worked well. But in the second month of use it started to give different problems. One is when I turn on the computer the screen keep black, the caps lock button flashing and the laptop fan running at max speed. No key I pressed would change the situation. The only way I found to  stop the fan is by opening the battery. Some times I need to do it 5 times for the computer works normal. In other times I  turn on the computer, the screen turns black and have a message saying "Press the ESC key for Startup Menu". I do the command, but it doesn't work. Then I had to turn the computer off and on again and it works. Some times the problem persist and I need to turn of and on more than one time. These problems have been happened many times The other problem with this computer is the sound. The speakers are too much little and are located on the bottom of the laptop and the sound is very low and terrible. I don't know if worth to buy it.
Do not but this device  From the get go this device was a let down. The touch screen was nearly useless since taps were off by a few inches and unreliable. After 3 weeks of use the mousepad is malfunctioning horribly, some keys are sticking, and the device has shutdown unexpectedly a number of times.
A Disappointment  This computer comes with a lot of features and software so it seemed like a good purchase. Initially I was pleased with the computer and everything it came with, but shortly after purchase the computer began to turn itself off suddenly, causing me to lose work.  The DVD drive would selectively function - sometimes the computer would not even detect that it had a built in DVD drive.  I did everything I was instructed to do but these issues were persistent.  Over time the number of issues - both software and hardware troubles - started to pile up.  My initial excitement turned to disappointment and regret.  I had to replace this machine a year and a half later, as it became too unreliable.
Why 2 stars ?  Why 2 stars ?  Because what I got was not what was advertised. It states there are a total of 2 USB 2.0 ports and 3 USB 3.0 ports. Sorry folks not even close. Only 1 USB 2.0 port and only 2 USB 3.0 ports. A total lie on product description with this one. A ton of bloatware too.   It works OK , but I kind  of expected more boot up speed. The display does cut way down on glare. Something I was looking for. For that no glare look you get a grainy kind of screen though. I find it acceptable because I have to have no glare or as little as possible .  Trade offs all the way on this one folks and NO I WOULD NOT BUY IT or RECOMMEND IT.
Wish I  didn't have to put any star on this computer!  This product was TERRIBLE.  I bought one and it wouldn't  turn on, the manufacturer  said that it was a hardware  issue. So I  returned  the computer  and ordered another  one.  Well the second  computer  worked fine for 2 days and the I  went to use it one the 3rd day and the screen  started blinking.  The manufacturer  said that this was a hardware  issue as well! So I  had to return that computer as well. I will never buy one of these computers again.
WORST LAPTOP EVER!!! DO NOT BUY IT!!!  I bought this computer for my fiance for school and it has been a complete NIGHTMARE. Google Dell laptop cursor problems or mouse problems. The computer randomly will select things when you don't even touch it! She cannot even use the computer because while using it the computer will select a different window, or tab, or paragraph etc etc. We have told dell of the problem and been through hours and hours of customer service bull crap. Every time its someone who barely speaks english and they have us do that same perfunctory steps that we have already done. Finally they replaced the mousepad and mother board. Guess what?? IT STILL HAS THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM. I then spent 3 hours on the phone trying to get them to replace the laptop.....they wouldnt do it!! I called multiple times to talk to a manage and each time the manager was "IN A MEETING" which means they either were lying or do not have managers. Lastly we sent it in to get repaired through dells 3rd party company. They replaced the hard drive and the operating system. YET AGAIN THE SAME PROBLEM PERSISTS!! DELL SELLS CRAP COMPUTERS AND THEY KNOW THEY ARE CRAP!!! HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAVE THIS SAME PROBLEM, LOOK ONLINE AT FORUMS!! I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER DELL AGAIN, TERRIBLE PRODUCT AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER IF YOU WANT IT TO BE ANYTHING MORE THAN A PAPER WEIGHT!!  EDIT: DELL HAS DISABLED REVIEWS ON THE DELL WEBSITE...AFTER LOG IN AND CLICKING ON THE "WRITE REVIEW" BUTTON YOU GET REDIRECTED TO THE COMPUTER SALE PAGE!! IT IT LIKE THIS FOR EVERY LAPTOP!! WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT DELL PRODUCTS??
Don't buy from computer upgrade king  They switched the hdd and it didn't come with a tray and instead they put a piece of Styrofoam to keep the hdd from moving around. They said that it was new but when i got it it was opened already although it still has the new computer smell. Someone probably bought it before me and then returned it after a short while. The laptop gave me problems after about a year where it suddenly shuts down when in use and won't turn on. Only the power button flashes when i try to turn it on and hard reset won't work either.
Worst computer I have ever bought. The screen bezel fell apart after 6 months. Dell laptops are junk.
it's not a good deal comparing to how this laptop's working...
Dont buy it!  Complete piece of crap.  So slow.  A complete waste of money.
I hate the apps on the computer.. I don't even use those types of apps
Refrain from buying gateways  My wife's Gateway laptop motherboard went out after one year.  They did not honor the hardware warranty which we purchased.  I bought this laptop thinking it looked pretty cool; once again it failed on me.  The HDD went out after 3months and I had to replace it.  Note to self:  Gateway uses the cheapest manufacturers for components.  This used to not be the case in the past with their desktops, but now it is.  I have three HDDs sitting on my shelf which are dead.  Each one of them are Hitachi.  One of which was in the Gateway computer.  It also overheats like you've never seen before.  Don't expect to sit this thing on a flat table without something underneath it and get away with it safely!  After the overheating the leather on the front started to bubble really badly.  I had to remove this because it looked horrible.  Summary: Do not buy this laptop.
I bought one, I don't think you should.  I am big apple fan - all the ipads, iphone, imac, mac books for years 13", 17" etc...  This is a nice machine and works well.  But the port hassle is too much of a pain.  1. With only one port I constantly am without the appropriate connector.  2. USB-C (C for charge customers for all new attachments) - $80 or a USB/HMDI splitter?  3. When you connect the adapter it looks god awful and ruins any design ideas JIve had.  4. More often than not when you need it you cant find it ($80 for a new one) and puts you out of business to connect hard drives, download photos etc...  The hassle factor overrides all the other wonderful features unfortunately.  PS Type on it for 3-4 minutes at the store before you buy to insure you don't mind the shallow keys. I am getting used to them with time but some friends can't.
Hard drive / controller failed twice.  Once under warranty, once after it had expired.  The second failure was about 18 months after I bought it.
Spec indicates built-in bluetooth but actual device does not have bluetooth  I purchased this laptop locally when it was initially released around the 1st week of November for the holiday season. The older version of this laptop released earlier this year did not have bluetooth. However, industry standard has changed, it is now standard for laptops in this price range to have built-in bluetooth, per indicated by the spec at the link below.  To provide the built-in bluetooth funtionality, Asus needs to rework the motherboard to provide a space for the required bluetooth chip if it's not already there. It seems to me that Asus may have decided to use up what's left over of the old motherboards for this first batch to get away with unsuspecting buyers since the average users don't normally use bluetooth with laptop.  I've been test driving the laptop for almost two weeks. I appreciate the fact it's slim and light weight making it easy to handle. At times I had to hit the space bar again to get that space activated in the document. I very much appreciate how quick it comes up from bootup and out of sleep/hibernate mode.  With my busy schedule, I appreciate the fact Windows 8 enables me to be more efficient.  However, I'm taking it back since I need the built-in bluetooth. I also resent the fact Asus is trying to pull a quick one on consumers. Asus may haven been able to get away with this type of misleading business practices with other nations, but please never to bring it here to the US!  With the growing global market, it is a fact there will be times where government from one nation is unable to directly influence the practice of others in a different nation.  However, there is a growing international consumer power movement taking place online, it is recommended that corporations and countries examine their practices to operate responsibly so as to avoid being placed on consumers' Blacklist.

don't buy it  There are 3 usb ports and it's a common problem that the two on the right side stop working. google it and you will see for yourself. I do a lot of mulitmedia work so this laptop is fast becoming useless for me. Also it's quite sluggish doing the most mundane of tasks. it wasn't at first, but it's not the workhorse that other acers have been.
Acer doesn't honor warranty  My Acer R3 unit quit working three times. Each time it was unable to start up Windows. The first two times they repaired it under warranty, but the third time they were no longer willing to honor their manufacture warranty despite it being well within the one-year warranty period. They would not repair it, replace it, or refund it. Acer just told me it was Amazon's problem. Thankfully Amazon did take care of it even though it was outside of the return period, but Acer sure fell flat on their face.
Don't Buy  Bad Product....
Initial Impressions are great but plagued with critical problems. Recommend you avoid!  UPDATE (Oct 2013): I hate many of Apple's business practices so I don't buy their products but it's becoming clear to me that if you want an Ultrabook-like experience, you're probably better off getting a Macbook Air. This XPS is not my primary machine so it's not exactly being put through the ringer but I've had all sorts of critical problems. I mostly used it for taking notes/studying when I was in school. Not exactly rigorous use. In fact, I haven't used it since I graduated back in May 2013 until now. Back in May the computer was "iffy" with respect to charging. By that I mean it would sometimes charge when plugged in and sometimes not. But since I was using it at school where outlets were always available and I was swamped with exams, I didn't think too much of it at the time. Well now it's final. The computer just doesn't recognize the stock adapter and refuses to allow the battery to charge. So that means what was supposed to be an ultra portable computer is no longer portable at all. Yet another critical problem from a $1000+ computer that I've barely even used! I understand that things go wrong from time to time but these are dealbreaker issues (see previous wifi issue in comments/original review). Additionally, there aren't really any Dell stores where you can quickly/easily get these things resolved and my experience has been that their tech support has been very stingy not offering much unless you've paid extra for HW support. The computer was practically brand new when I had trouble with the Wifi issue when the tech rep tried to tell me that I would have to pay extra for not having the HW support package. Sleek, sexy design that's fun to use but you should probably just avoid this computer unless you have lots of time, money, and patience to devote to critical failures.  ORIGINAL REVIEW (Nov 2012): I love the Ultrabook concept as I've been using a Netbook for the last 4 years. For me, portability is king but I wanted something a little more capable and easier to use than my Netbook.  Upon delivery, I was a little disappointed as the entire thing seemed a little bigger than I was expecting based on the reviews and advertising. It's noticeably smaller than most 13" computers, but just a bit bigger than 11" computers. Now I think it's actually the perfect size offering a great sized screen in a smaller casing. Also, having toyed around with some other Ultrabooks with a smaller profile, I can appreciate the solid feel of the XPS 13. On other Ultras, I was immediately annoyed how typing on the keyboard would cause the screen to shake because of flimsy support. None of that here with the XPS 13. Very solidly built especially considering it's size.  I also thought the screen looked washed and grainy but this seems to be the norm for Ultrabooks. The vivid tablet and smartphone displays are really starting to spoil me, I suppose. Nevertheless, once I got used to this I decided it's fine.  The feel of the computer is absolutely amazing. The keyboard is very quick with great feel making typing very natural and easy. It's become my favorite keyboard to type on, even better than my desktop's keyboard. Track pad also has a great feel to it but can seem unresponsive some times and oversensitive at others. Given Windows 8's significant reliance on sometimes subtle gestures, this can get annoying from time to time but the added convenience is probably worth the trade off.  Windows 8 really makes this thing shine. Windows apps allow you to really take advantage of this 13 inch display taking every application right to the edge of that screen. It makes the entire experience fun and remarkably pleasing to look at.  Unfortunately, Windows 8 still has some significant quirks if you plan on buying a computer to do all your heavy lifting. For me, I have several computers so for my essential computing needs, I can simply use one of the others. But if this is your end all be all computer, I think you might want to wait. The biggest problem I've noticed is that 8 seems to have problems with the wireless adapter. The practical implication is that the computer simply can't keep a wireless connection.  You heard me right. In 2012, this $1200 computer can't keep a wireless connection going. After any sort of extended use, the connection dies and I have to spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to get the computer to restore the connection. Sometimes I have to abandon a particular access point and try to find a second one or tether my phone.  Other quirks are more typical of a OS upgrade in that you're at the mercy of a lot of different agencies to update their software to be compatible with Win 8.  So while I'm really impressed with the build quality, styling, performance, and operating system design, the bottom line is that with system essential quirks still out there, it's just not ready for prime time. When I really need a computer to get things done reliably, I still have to rely on my netbook. It's a very promising machine but at the time it's not worth the price tag to be so limited.
it only worked for two months.
Cool but dissapointed  I bought this laptop and i loved the design, strong, powerful, a little bit heavy to carry around. I was loving it because it was really fast, it boot it in about 3 secs, but after one week of playing with it the screen turned green and pink had to return it.
Disappointed  The screen was damaged.
Incredibly slow
Battery is a problem  The battery is a big problem. It takes forever to charge it six hours. Then after 3 days was dead and cannot be recharged again. Do not buy this.
Robbery  This was extremely old. Would not even operate it or update it because of the actual age of this!
This computer absolutely sucks. Lasted me not even a year.
Horrible.  Don't buy.  I bought this on June 19th, 2014.  On October 9th Asus tech support advised me to perform a total refresh because of a malfunctioning headset. It was a complete disaster after that with the inability to open simple Word and Adobe files. My accounting software for work was completely disabled. I have to now buy a new one because the software company does not make patches for it anymore. My other software were also disabled and their desktop icons greyed out. Finally, last Saturday night, November 8th, 2014 the whole system completely shut down on its own. It does not charge or turn on. Thanks!
It lasted 4 months and 3 days...  Acer warranty only lasts 90 days!  I never write reviews... Normally, I do my due diligence and buy quality items.  My laptop worked great...  4 months and 3 days later it won't turn on or charge.  Acer only gives a 90 day warranty.  They told me my only recourse is to get it fixed myself....  Will not by an acer again...  Buyer beware!
problem with the hard drive so graphics do not display property.  Advertised software is not working because the operating system will not update.  Wish I did not trust Amazon!
Terrible product. Waste of time  The computer arrived on time.  It has crashed several times.  The video driver stops functioning.  The screen freezes.  We have spent over $500 with our IT department trying to fix the problems and it still keeps crashing. We need our money back!  Terrible product.  Waste of time.  Waste of money.  I am a physician and it wasted so much of my time.  My entire office runs on Dell and we've never had so many problems!
Complete waste of money  Do not buy this only 32GB, Motherboard does not support adding a hardrive or upgrading RAM.  Computer is basically worhtless unless you just want to surf the net.  My computer guy said most of the computers resources would be used on startup.  He said this is what they usually use in chromebooks ect but not on a laptop.  My cell phone has more storage and is faster than this laptop. Complete waste of money.
Would you give away 200$ ? If you buy this, you might as well.  When I first checked this computer out on Amazon, I was ecstatic. I was thrilled to see it come in the mail. After the first few minutes of opening the packaging, I noticed that the computer was a lot smaller than I thought. That wasn't a bad thing because I wanted a small computer I could fit in my bag. After opening the fresh computer, I turned it on with something that could be called a flimsy power button. However, that didn't stop me from wanting to keep the computer for the rest of my college days. I noticed that the system was Ubuntu. I never dealt or even heard of Ubuntu. I never want to again. Almost all of their programs are glitched. It's completely locked down. You have basically no freedom on it. You can't download 90% of the programs online because most of them are for Windows and Mac. Youtube videos or any video I wanted to view for class didn't work. I tried to download the latest Adobe Flash Player, but it wouldn't download for some reason. Later on I found out you had to download from the terminal. Anyway, It's basically all the negative parts of the Mac and Windows combined. It's as glitched as a Windows computer, and it's as locked down as a Mac. I tried to open a program on it and it just stayed in the middle of the screen unloaded. I had to turn it on and off just to allow the program to "work". It never worked even when I got it to stop glitching. The Keyboard is also very small. If you're good at typing, your pinky touches the Ctrl key or the arrow key and it's very frustrating. I foolishly looked over all of that. I just said that I will try to make it work. Impossible. One day I was trying to download a CD mounter (because it doesn't have a CD/DVD drive). I went to the terminal and attempted to download it from there. Then I noticed that I wasn't typing anything. In my head I'm thinking "why". As in, why can't this thing do anything right. After typing for a while, something is finally typed. Yes. numbers come up as I'm trying to type in "sudo". The Keyboard literally broke in a week. It's both the horrible operating system of Ubuntu along with the crappy forged Notebook Laptop that made me want to return this. I thought about burning this thing. Unless you're familiar with Ubuntu, I suggest you look else where for a notebook. There are plenty decent Notebooks at this size that won't give you the horror this thing gave me.
For Those Who Don't  So I posted this on Lenovo's page after my experience with their on-site tech today. I'm going to just keep posting this everywhere I can find.  Lenovo; For Those Who Don't:  January 23rd I received the IdeaPad Y510p from Lenovo, and it ran like a dream for 13 days, then I go to take my dog outside and put my laptop in sleep mode and come back in and it won't turn back on. I called in and had the option to return/refund it or repair it. I went with repair in hopes of being able to keep my data and awaited the box that tech support said I would be receiving in 3-5 days...  It's the motherboard that needs replaced; power light turns on but the fans, hard drive, keyboard lights, screen, and even USB power are unresponsive. A $1,649 paperweight.  20 days later I call back, having been busy with two jobs in Advertising, furious. I found out that it was never sent out and that it was just kind of forgot about. So you kindly "escalated" the repair to an on-site request after you said it would take almost twenty days for a repair and I would still have to wait, that you thought I was sending it in a second time for a second repair, and that you said I couldn't refund it until I told you I talked to a Sales Manager and they said I could and you looked into my history and found I actually did talk to someone and I could due to the situation.  Well that on-site guy THAT YOU SENT OUT came today and broke the laptop even more. He lost one screw when taking it apart, forgot to put two screws back in, broke the bottom latch/lock for the laptop, part of the frame (a little plastic clip on the inside but it looks warped now) and was banging the laptop, jabbing it with his plastic tool, and kept saying "I sure hope I don't broke it, don't wanna do that!" I took pictures and cringed the whole time. I about had a stroke watching this guy "try and not break" my laptop. AND IT'S STILL NOT FIXED. It's just been sitting on my desk since I got it.  This is a work laptop. I not only make money on this laptop, I spend money on it monthly for my software. I make $18 an hour at the job I got this for, and it has cut back my time there drastically. I can't work there I can only work from home. I was averaging about 3-5 hours a day until the laptop broke. Now I get less because my home computer isn't meant for this work. The software is $20 a month that I can't use. My freelance pays $30-$60 an hour just for design fees. I've lost more money because of this laptop possibly than for what it's even worth.  You better get back to me soon. You have my case number. You have my name, phone number, and email. If Lenovo is for "Those Who Do" then what you need to DO is start making up for what you DON'T DO. So do something right for once and call me.  This laptop has not only cost me time and money, but now it's cost me my patience.
If your looking for junk......  Unfortunately I must give this laptop a terrible rating. It is truly aggravating to spend so much money and receive such low quality merchandise. I bought it about 4 months ago and never had the ability to send it in to fix because I need it for work and don't have a second one to use while this one is getting repaired. So for 4 months I tried using it and it is as slow as it gets..... I have great Internet connection and my other devices load really quick but this one is just as I said SLOW... If you have time to waist buy it otherwise.... put your money better places.
Less than a year after purchasing, the hard drive has failed.
Defective Computer!  The first day I used it online it kept freezing. The second day I used it the screen kept blinking and then went to a screen with diagonal lines and then cut to a glowing black screen. Can't get it to do anything now. Don't waste your time on this computer! It's going back.
The multi-touch trackpad is the worst thing about this piece of crap  The multi-touch track pad has allot of functions which makes for a nice case of "bat s*** haywire" later on. PLEASE PURCHASE A WARRANTY ON THIS!!!!! I have read MANY different people's posts on forums that experience the same problem. One minute you will type something and if you click send it will erase the text, it highlights things I have no intention of highlighting, opens programs when moving your cursor past a program icon, has ended up sending emails when all I do is click to read them. I bought a warranty with it so I fully intend to have it fixed, but I am here to tell you that YOU NEED TO DO THE SAME, BUY A WARRANTY!!!
Screen Malfunction in less than a year of ownership!  After less than a year, the screen is not working properly. After the computer is closed and then opened again, the screen turns gray and has to be powered off and restarted. EVERY TIME!
Not made for CAD  Do not buy this build!! I just returned it because the UHD screen is not supported by Autodesk. After loading AudoCAD 2016 the program would not open properly and all icons were too small to see no matter what what adjustments you made. The cursor would also move across the screen in a choppy manner. Autodesk will only support the normal HD screens so do your self a favor and stay away from this for any type of CAD programs.  Amazon was great to deal with and took the laptop back after explaining what was happening.
Sorry but it sucks after a year  This laptop is wonderful at first. About 8-13 months later your doomed. You montior will go out and the laptop is made with a defective chipset that was recalled by Intel, but Samsung still sells the laptop. You can google Samsung NP-QX411-W01US monitor issues and find so many utube videos and articles about the monitor. With thinner laptops available these days its better to buy something else. When this laptop came out it was a very good one buy the hardware details and it will play hardcore video games but it won't last long enough to get your money worth and the manufacture warranty will not cover any thing. If I would have paid less than $500 maybe I would feel like 1 year is not bad but I recieved it as a gift years ago and the price was well over $1000 bucks. It was way before its time but the screen didn't last over its time. I'm sorry but I probably will not buy or even take as a gift another Samsung laptop. Its beautiful but its insides are worthless. Now I have to buy another monitor to replace the defective screen but with the chipset being an issue I'm sure the motherboard will burn out right after I replace the monitor. At this point I hate to say it but its boardline Dell quality and Dell sucks.
VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED!  The app selection is horrible. I would expect more from Google. There were other keyboard issues, I could have dealt with that, but not Google's Chrome apps store Returning this Chromebook after 1 day!
Dells Break & Warranty is Not Honored by Dell  Do not buy Dell computers!  Just look at their complaints on their Customer Service ratings on ConsumerAffairs.com -- with almost 4,000 reviews they earn an average of just 1 star (out of 5) -- for wide spread terrible service!  Their customer service department refuses to help.  Our new Dell Inspiron 15 3000 Series is 9 months old and totally broken because the power cord port no longer works.  It was handled gently and not even used as our primary computer in our home, but the power port was built so flimsily that it broke after about 8 months.  To make things worse, Dell says our one year warranty won't cover this - they refused to let me speak to a manager too, to plead my case with them ("my manager will tell you the same thing").  They wrote, "according to the warranty the system is not covered for any breakage."  What?!  They will cover breakage only if people buy their "Complete Care Warranty."  What a dishonest rip off.
This particular computer had two keys that did not function. The Enter key on one side and the space bar. I sent it back and was refunded my money.
trackpad is a joke
Good value with fast delivery but upgrade sucks.  1/2 price of new. Battery charge excellent. Wish I had not upgraded to Mountain Lion, battery charge dropped from 7 hours to one hour. Apple has no fix available.
Worst laptop I have seen  I bought this machine thinking that toshiba designs good laptop but after using it for 3-4 months, its key-board doesnt work properly. There are so many hard-ware defects i have found. Service Center also does not provide satisfactory services. I would advise not to go for toshiba laptops. Better go for Dell or IBM.
PRODUCT DID NOT WORK, SELLER GAVE A FULL REFUND.
... to hot and loud plus the graphics may be good but the screen sucks  the dell laptop get's to hot and loud plus the graphics may be good but the screen sucks
Purchased in Dec 2014.  Battery and HDD died in Jan 2016, just one month out of warranty.  Even when it was working, it was so weak that the software that controlled the trackpad lagged even during light use.  The keyboard was not very responsive and frequently missed keys.  I guess you get what you pay for, and what I paid for was apparently a laptop for 13 months.
Buyers beware, hardware problems are very likely given my experience.  I decided to buy this laptop after I started having problems with the video card on my over-two-year-old computer.  Here are some things I noticed, from best to worst:  1. The battery life is as advertised.  Very good.  2. The performance is good.  i7 core, good specs, good computer.  However, I tried to run a heavily modded version of Minecraft on it, and had to change to many of the lower quality graphics settings to avoid lag.  3. I am unaccustomed to touchpads like this one has.  Not only does the tracking pad cover the click buttons, the entire touchpad functions as a left-click, with right-click being in the lower right corner.  Previously, I typed with fingers on the buttons at all times; this touchpad threw me off.  Ultimately, this comes down to personal preference, but I dislike the touchpad.  4. The sound is bad.  Lower-register sounds such as drum beats are sometimes not audible at all.  If you need to listen to music or whatever, you need headphones; the quality is not good at all otherwise.  5. TWO DIFFERENT COMPUTERS OF THIS MODEL DEVELOPED CRIPPLING HARDWARE PROBLEMS IN THE SPAN OF THREE WEEKS.  Upon delivery of the first machine, I booted it up and was immediately met with the error message, "Your battery has experienced a permanent failure and needs to be replaced."  Welp.  Because the battery was integrated, I couldn't replace it myself, so I had to return it and get a second computer of the same model.  I installed Ubuntu on the second computer because I dislike Windows 8.  In just a little over two weeks, during which time I subjected the computer to nothing more than what I consider to be everyday use, the computer developed problems with the motherboard that rendered it completely useless - one day, out of the blue, it just stopped turning on.  Couldn't do a thing to fix it.  Fortunately, this was within Amazon's 30-day full refund policy on laptops, so I was able to return that one, too, but if the problem had developed a week later, I would have been much worse off.  I will not be purchasing another computer of this model; it says something about the hardware that two different machines broke so quickly.
Not Refurbished Properly!  Acer did a poor job in refurbishing this device! My device was still enrolled in the school that had used it prior to my purchase. Because of this I am unable to log into my own Chromebook due to enterprise enrollment. I have to go through google to fix this issue when Acer should of handled it originally.
Bad purchase !
... laptop arrived in only two days and that was great! However  The laptop arrived in only two days and that was great! However, once I started using the system I was very disappointed. The laptop is very slow and I was not aware that I would not be able to at least write a paper on it. It is really just a glorified tablet. I had to spend $165 for a security package and I guess now I will have to purchase software so I can at least write a paper. Also the laptop is in poor physical condition.
Warranty -- how about it when I am overseas?  Dear Sir/Madam,  I am at a lost, and discouraged. I purchased the item in preparation for my overseas trip to the Philippines. I am now in the Philippines.  It served me well for two weeks. And then today, it just stopped functioning. It would not turn on and work.  What will I do now? I am overseas some 8,000 miles away from dear USA and amazon.com.  How will I have this item changed or repaired or whatever?  Please, SOS, I need your advice. I need the item very much to use.  Rufino S. Ignacio - a regular customer of amazon.com
Avoid this laptop  Crashes all the time. Almost unusable.
Would not buy again, does not have enough memory!!
Buyer beware!  Complete waste of money... My five year old Dell(!) laptop is faster! If you want to use Facebook, Amazon, etc.. you will need to plan ahead as it takes a reallllllyyyy long time for any of these (among many, many other sites) to load, if they load at all... Also, comes loaded with junk.
Very Disappointed.  Very poor service.  Came out of the box with very slow internet coonection, and problems which seemed to get worse over time.  Finally called Acer customer service, and discovered multiple \windows errors.  They walked us through resetting the system.  This didn't work, so they said it must be a hardware issue, which they were willing to repair under the warranty as long as I was willing to pay  $60 for shipping and handling, plus they  couldn't guarantee the  work.  I would not buy this again, and I would return it if it weren't  just outside the  return window.  I recommend neither the product nor the company service experience.  Purchase at your own risk.
VERY EXPENSIVE JUNK ....not pleased with Amazon  After only a week this very beautiful yet badly made ultra went dead . The build quality is terrible . The charger stem looks like something you would get with a 10 dollar electric toy . Acer was a mess when I attempted to get some help ,they even asked if I wanted to PAY for software help on a NEW ITEM ????  Amazon - The customer service at Amazon has gone from the best in the business to now the worst! Spent five hours on the phone getting the run around.......promise after promise of help and then NOTHING.NEXT time I buy quality and service. Amazon sells millions of products ,I can by no means hold them accountable for the quality of all the items they sell but I can and do hold them responsible for their customer care and help which is Horrible !! Ps After spending some time reading other reviews I see many others are in the same situation with Amazon.
Warped Case  This is a very flimsy computer even for the price point. The case in the one I received wouldn't even allow the computer to sit flat because of warping, and there is no way to remove the need for a password and Google account. There are many other chromebooks that are better for around the same price as this one.
I Cannot get a printer to work with this laptop, I have tried two Cannon printers.
Hard drive WAY to small  Very disappointed in this product. Hard drive is woefully inadequate to do anything. There was not even enough space to download the "FREE" Microsoft upgrade that was advertised as a selling feature.
Came with a cracked screen  Waited for this item and it came with the screen cracked and didn't work
Breaks easily (sensitive)  After having it not even for a year half of my screen is blank and im not even rough on my elcetronics. It was in my drawer for a while... I open it and "bam" it started out as a line in the middle of the screen and then got bigger to half my screen. Now i cant use it... I thought this computer was a good price because how vintage it is not how easily it breaks.
Missing items  I was not very satisfy with it for there were no programs or a hard drive. This was a gift and they had to get different things downloaded on it themselves.
The keyboard started working in a wrong way. It's repeating a letter when I'm not pressing it. And touchpad is lagging and not working rightly. This happens around 1 year after buying this laptop.
Bad Laptop  Hadn't had the laptop but 7 months and the display went out. I contacted MSI and had it sent to them which cost me $104.00. They sent me an email that read "RMA technician found the notebook had been dissemble and tampered before which caused damages. Customer induced damages are not covered under the limited warranty. To repair, we would require below quotation: $405.00". The laptop came to me factory sealed when purchased from Amazon.com and I wouldn't know the first thing on how to get into a laptop so no one had been inside. I contacted MSI customer support but got no where with them.  They either didn't want to eat the repair cost to fix it or the Tech didn't know what the hell he is doing.. I also sent them a letter stating all this but I never heard back from them. Now the only way to use my computer is to hook another monitor to it so I can see what my display is without putting anymore money into this cheap thing. Bottom line, NO MORE MSI COMPUTERS FOR ME.
Has basic problem
It looks sexy.  But doesn't seem to be built well. The monitor is flimsy (and has stopped working if I rotate the monitor too far).
Major flaws. Do not buy!!!  I have purchased a lot of items on Amazon and have never written a negative review until now.  Buyer beware!!!!  This computer is poorly manufactured and I hope that I can get a refund. I've had this computer since January and would have returned it sooner except that I loaded so many programs on it and have so many files that it is hard to start over. Plus, I was hoping the issues could be resolved but it seems continuous build up of new ones. So now, I give up!!!  1) The WiFi is completely unstable as has been mentioned by so many others. It periodically once or twice a week just won't work. I have to troubleshoot and it keeps saying it had to fix the wireless adapter. So I will not elaborate further as it has been thoroughly discussed.  2). The touchpad design is flawed in that it is placed off to the left. This means that when or if you slightly brush up against it while typing, the cursor moves and you end up typing in another portion of the sheet which is really annoying.  3) I currently have an issue where the updates are not loading because my computer says that  a program is currently loading. However, technical support cannot find any programs that are loading. So all of my automatic updates for all programs cannot load. I cannot back up my iPad or phone because my iTunes account  has a new update that is required and it cannot load. So no back ups is a REAL problem. Neither can my cloud programs back up my files. Yet Acer wants to refresh my program which will loose my software and possibly the files that I have recently created. Off to calling my independent computer consultant again and forking out repair money.  4)  My computer ar times freezes and goes really slowly requiring a hard shut down ( removing the battery and holding the power button for 60 seconds) to reset.  5) My fully charged battery operates for a maximum of 2.5 hours when working on Excel files. No heavy movies just basic typing. I don't understand the 5 hour claim. That is not my experience at all.  6). Runs slowly at times even after disabling all start up programs.  Sorry to say, but this computer is junk and a waste of money. I will never buy Acer again. Acer customer service is lacking. They are too quick to want to refresh/restore the computer instead of working through the issues. I've been able to hire a local computer repair consultant who has helped me fix many issues but it's not right for a 9 month old machine that is still under warranty.  There are plenty other good computers out there. Skip this one.
I absolutely hate this laptop  I absolutely hate this laptop, because of the fact that you can only use apps that are pre-installed in the chrome book web store, and you can't download any apps online because of the built in security system. I hate the fact that they didn't advertise nor have a warning label stating. "caution google decides what apps you can use in your life"  I wouldn't have cared if the web store had good apps such as VLC media player or many other i could keep going but my point being it quiet frankly sucks. Also i have spotify premium and i can't open up spotify app without wifi, so there is that. The only 2 things i liked about this laptop is how fast it can boot up, and the speaker system, other than that this laptop is absolutely garbage i wouldn't buy this laptop unless you only want s***y apps that are pre- installed in the web store. This laptop is still fairly new so i don't know what else sucks on it yet. It has also been a week since i messaged google about the situation and they have yet to reply back.
This is the first review I have ever left, however I feel that others should be warned about my experience. I received it promptly, and gave it to my daughter as a gift. She started laughing when she opened it and asked if it was a joke; there was a prior return slip still in th box with the computer! So obviously Amazon did not even look at the retuned/damaged product before shipping it out to me. I was so embarrassed. She went on to test out the Chrome Book only to discover that it was indeed broken, the right click did not work. So instead of giving my daughter a memorable gift in a good way; I will always be remembered as giving her the Chrome Book with the return slip already in it. Thank you for ruining a special day because you don't look at the items that get returned. When I returned it, I included the previous slip too. Hopefully no one gives a gift with 2 return labels.
STAY AWAYYYY!!!  This computer is straight garbage it was a piece of garbage the minute I opened it. Tried resetting the computer it got completely messed up. Sent it in to be repaired paid 15$ for it to be back in a week it took 3 weeks. On top of that when I got it back its even worse then it was before it won't kid anything and if it does some security measure they installed blocks everything!!! Then to make it worse their customer service is literally the worse. You answer 100 questions to the automated machine, then a person answers you and you answer the same 100 questions again then they say they can't help you and transfer you then you answer the same 100 questions again then that person says they can't help you then you answer the same 100 questions again. Listen I'm not one to complain or even give bad reviews but this laptop and HP customer service is straight garbage I'm so mad I bought this piece of junk please listen to me DO NOT BUY THIS I guarantee this computer is discontinued very shortly
Bad viewing angles.  Bad all around.  Just got this thing.  Viewing angles are atrocious.  As someone pointed out, getting Windows 10 on it is like jumping through hoops.  I wanted it as a developer machine, but the 720p resolution will kill my eyes.  I'm sending this back ASAP.
I bought 2. One will no longer charge, the other is still working.  These were Christmas gifts and the return policy has expired by 1 month.
Keyboard sucks! Don't buy it!  I bought this laptop to make taking notes in class easier. Little did I know that while plugged in, the keyboard functions fine, but once unplugged, keys have a delay time before registering leading me to go back and correct multiple words while trying to focus on the professor. Consider your money wasted if you're buying this laptop. The only thing good about this laptop is the battery life and and the large storage. If only asus didn't skimp on the keyboard, this would've been a solid 10/10 for me. I will never buy another asus laptop for the rest of my life.
a piece of crap, but Ubuntu Linux runs well on it  Where I work we have two choices of laptops, the HP 640 or a Mac. For a die hard Linux guy like me, the HP 640 is the only option for running a pure Linux distro.  Given these choices, I estimate approximately 99.9% of the developers at my work have chosen a Mac over the HP 640.  What I like about the HP 640: - Ubuntu Linux works great - Docking station is well supported. - Multiple displays works well. - Battery life is good.  What I hate about the HP 640: - The screen is awful and hurts my eyes. - The keyboard is awful. - It is heavy.  In order to be productive my laptop needs three things: it must run a pure Linux distro, it must have a good screen, and it must have a good keyboard.  Unfortunately the HP 640 fails 2 out of 3 of these requirements. It is easy understand why so many developers at my work choose a Mac, since it has a great screen and keyboard.
Battery pack dies suddenly.  Just like all the rest.  Like many others here, my Chromebook battery just suddenly died without warning.  I had my original unit replaced when the recall was issued - the new one worked great, right up until it didn't.  No warning, just suddenly it dies when unplugged from the AC adapter.  All told the battery lasted 12-18 months or so.  I did open mine up to investigate.  crosh -> battery_test revealed that the battery is in decent shape (87% health or so) and had a charge, but wasn't powering the system when unplugged..  The actual "battery" is a pair of Li-Ion flat packs in a plastic tray, wired to a small charge controller board, and the whole thing is covered with a sticker.  The entire construction seems sketchy: one battery has its tabs tacked directly to the controller, the other is soldered via wires instead to what appears to be test points, and the board is silkscreened "EDUBOOK-L (2.6)" meaning it was probably repurposed from some other device.  A multimeter shows that the cells have voltage, but nothing is measured at the points where the cable links to the mainboard,  The tab-attached cell is directly under the trackpad and flexes due to inadequate support in the case: this can cause it to weaken and eventually break.  My guess is that some little SMT part on the the charge controller fried due to crap engineering, maybe overly sensitive to static shock or overcharging or something.  Possibly, the "fix" for the original battery fire issue was to make the controller board die first instead.  It was cheap to begin with so I'm not out much, but there is definitely technical design problems with the battery.
The battery started to fail.  After warranty expiration by 9 days. The battery started to fail.. it drains the whole battery life in less than 8 minutes. The laptop restarts by itself some often when I play games.  This laptop was so powerful and great for the past year. but I'm really disappointed now. What a sad story.
JUNK  JUNK  JUNK  o did i say this is JUNK  what a waste of money and time.  Cheap deal meant  JUNK  Please don't waste your money there is nothing in this deal.
Worst Laptop Bad customer service  Worst laptop Ever don't you get it especially from this seller worst customer service. Wifi is not working and takes too long to start the system and the seller is not taking it back saying 30 day return period is over.
I bought this product for my niece to help her with her school work.  Within a month we started getting issues with the screen.  We are waiting diagnostics on it now.
Quality dissapointing  I was frankly very disappointed by this computer. The speed and battery time is ok. But the keyboard has a very low quality feel to it - it is very "loose" - feels very cheap. Also the web camera is terrible. I use Skype a bit and everyone tells me I have an awful camera. Finally the microphone is also low quality - I have had to buy an extra headset otherwise people can't hear me. I would pay a couple of hundred extra for a Dell
Save your money - Wish I could make this zero stars  After a career of using Microsoft I switched to Apple products, this proved to be the worst choice ever! They pressure you into their "care plans " And then when you need their help in store if you're five minutes late for your appointment they cancel you. And when you're in their facility asking for help there constantly looking at their watch because apparently they must have a time limit for how long they can work with you as you learn their tools. These are facts cause if you buy the product you will find out for yourself. And The facial recognition of the photos software, don't let them kid you it does not work unless every single star in the universe aligns. After seven months of using this product, their lack of customer service, their lack of in-house customer service, Yet their success of a highly overpriced product, I highly encourage you to save your money because the hype of their products far exceeds the quality. Take it from a successful leader in business this is why we never use these in our Fortune 100 company.
Way too small to be practical  It's a mac book. Which means it's awesome. But, it is way smaller than you think it is, if you've never seen one before.  I bought this as a fall back mac but it's way too small for me to use. I kept it for emergency purposes, but I'll never buy an 11" Display again.
Boycott Toshiba products.  Purchase Netpc on 8/12/09 and Toshiba refuse to upgrade me to Windows 7- because it came with Windows XP preinstalled! Now they are selling them with Windows 7 preinstalled go figure.
Screen doesnt stay open.  When trying to watch movies in  bed, with a pillow proping it, the screen does not stay open.
Seriously disappointed with the Chromebook - This Samsung is a great bit of kit - but the idea of a chromebook is seriously let-down by the crappy keyboard layout. As a typist, the DELETE key and CAPSLOCK keys are pretty important and no chromebook has them- as I found out. I know there are workarounds, but I am talking here the need to support users that are fairly proficient with a keyboard and who find it extremely disruptive to have to do weird keyboard manoeuvres and somersaults to do a common and highly repetitive task like DELETE. It's particularly surprising to see such a bad design idea given Google's push into office applications like Google documents etc that are supposedly there to to appeal to those us who want to create serious documentation...not to mention the ultimate goal of stealing us away from using MS Office... Thank goodness I can just send it back to AMAZON with a full refund.
Worthless! Not reliable.  I had issues from day one with this laptop. Slow, keys falling off. After about a year it was just not functional at all! Did I mention slow? What I had to do to use it you would not believe. sometimes if I wasn't careful it would freeze and shut down on me during my assignments and I had to type my response all over again. This laptop is worthless. I got a new toshiba for about 200 and I LOVE IT.
Don't buy this laptop  The 32GB hardrive is way too small for Windows.  It quickly gets eaten up with windows updates, app data, and other things that can't be easily cleaned out or stored on an SD card.  I bought this laptop last year and only have Office, Itunes, and Norton installed and there is only a few hundred megabytes of space left.
Liked the tablet while it worked  Liked the tablet while it worked.  Now will it not power on.  Threw it in the trash.  Don't waste your money.
DOA(Dead On Arrival)  Was a very upset because its a Christmas gift. But what can you do? "NOTHING"!!! Product charged for two hours and when attempting to boot NOTHING!!! Lights come on NO PICTURE NO SOUND Black SCreen. Ordering a different product.. Shipping Speed was Outstanding!!! Sad my baby girll will not get her Christmas present from me unitl after Christmas.. This is the first time I have ever had to return any product I have received via Amazon. So I am still an amazon.com customer.
Very bad mechanism design for make panel edge damage.
Powerful for the price, but...  I bought this about 3 years ago, after having a Toshiba last for 10 years before dying.  Pros: For 3 years ago, this was one powerful laptop.  I haven't had any speed issues, except when I try to play Starcraft 2, it lags a little on the lowest settings.  Excellent for surfing the internet, or just taking around school. I have used it for Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator with no issues. This was my daily-use computer and generally didn't give me performance problems or blue screens. Generally.  Cons: Straight out of the box, the volume knob didn't work right.  The hibernate function didn't work right either.  After a couple months, the screen was messing up and a cord needed to be replaced (which Toshiba replaced and shipped the computer free of charge due to warrantee). After a few months, the mouse button chrome started chipping. After about a year the power adapter cord just completely broke in half. I have had some terrible heat issues after awhile. It would overheat and shut down while watching videos or playing games. All. The. Time.  Even YouTube videos would cause it to overheat. Speaking of which, it can't play 720p HD videos smoothly. A cooling pad helped a lot, but didn't solve the overheating problem.  I checked for dust in the fans, but there really wasn't enough to do this. Also, really bad battery life.  1 hour max with normal(non-wifi) use.  A couple weeks ago it died.  It straight-up won't start up anymore. It didn't have any viruses.  It was some hardware failure. I don't even really want to find the problem because I am tired of dealing with the overheating issue and the overall poor setup.  That's my story of the life of this laptop. Hopefully I just got a lemon. You have been warned.
does not start up after reset  First impression was really good: Sleek, fast, doesn't heat up, etc.  My happiness only lasted for a week. I needed to reset it. Just pasting my HP Helpdesk message here. Make up your own mind. I am trying to send it in. Let's see if this works as I am located in Central America...  "HP Recovery Manager failed. Error code = 0xEFFFFF08  All the options of getting the computer running after a failed reset failed.  I am thinking about putting an alternative OS on an USB Stick and boot from USB. Need to find out if such a system exists for Windows 8. I didn't get it on CD-ROM as the computer (HP Envy 4-1110us) doesnt have a CD drive anyways.  The computer is a week old only."  EDIT: HP could not solve my problem yet. I strongly warn you to buy this if you plan to take it outside the US. They only repair this machine in very few countries as it seems. So I have to ship it from Central America to the US at my own costs. And this easily costs me 30%-50% of the value of the computer. I am deeply disappointed about how weak the service of HP is outside the US but probably I was just naive, thinking that I bought a strong brand. This review will be upgraded if HP solves my problem, but so far: STAY AWAY FROM HP!
Not So Much...  Was really impressed with this computers speed and excellent video output.  Looked really great on my 4K TV the first day.  Problem is on the second day, it would not power up.  No lights, nothing, just dead.  And yes, it was plugged in and charging....... Really glad I purchased from Amazon, easy return and refund.  However, I'd much rather have a computer to send video to my TV instead of boxing it up to return to Amazon.  Hope you all have better luck.  Now I get to search again for a reliable lap top with UHD HDMI output.  Any suggestions on another laptop with same video quality would be appreciated.  One day of operation equals one star.......
Finicky and Frustrating  I don't recommend the ASUS X200MA Notebook. Mine is new and really finicky. The mouse constantly jumps to the bottom of the screen as I'm clicking, which opens and minimizes windows that I don't want opened or minimized, or takes me out of the desktop all together. Also, the mouse pad is really sensitive. It considers even the softest touch a click, which means I often end up accidentally closing open tabs just by placing my fingers onto the mouse. I've lost a lot of work because of this. I tried removing the tap-to-click feature from the mouse pad settings, but it isn't an option. Really frustrating computer.
Could have been better  It's always annoying to spend so much money on a notebook and after a few months have the paint flaking off the keyboard. The speakers also crackle a lot. When you spend extra for good sound quality you expect that the quality would be commensurate with the price. I hate to be the tester for Samsung because its expensive for me. Read the reviews and choose wisely. Just choose something else.
Unreliable product - avoid  This chromebook worked beautifully for two months. Then, it failed to boot. It also failed to charge (the light wouldn't display). It was sent to a toshiba repair center (at cost) and after over two weeks arrived back. After five minutes out of the box, the screen blacked out again and is unresponsive.
Spacebardoesn'twork  Iamwriting this reviewwiththe laptop and I am not goingtocorrect the places where the spacebardoes notwork.  This is why I amreturningit. I did have this exact same computerfor almost2 years and it worked great so Idon'tknow what they changed tocreatethis major flaw wherethe spacebar doesn't work. I returnedtheorginalone with this sameissueand thereplacement isnotmuchbetter exceptit only seems to be thespacebarwhereas the other computerwasmultiplekeys.  I spokewith HP customersupport for 55minutesand did not getany resolutiondespitemultiple troubleshooting "efforts." Then the HP person toldmeAmazon wouldn't takeit back because it was out of the return window, which was completely nottrue. Do you think peopleare going to keep something like this because you tryto tellthem lies?Notimpressedwith this computerorHP!! Amazon,however,iswonderfulabout the return process andI amthankful I got it here becauseif I had bought it fromHP I obviously wouldn'thave been able to return it despite only having it acoupledays.  The reason Igaveittwo starsinsteadofone isit is lightweight and pretty,and if you want to useit as a desktop with a separatekeyboardattached that wouldlikely work.
JUNK!  ASUS was recommended to me by some colleagues in our IT department, but I have found it to be junk. I have had a K55N mid-price range laptop for four months and the keyboard and screen have malfunctioned. I tried to return it for service which took three phone calls and chats, but was told it had been damaged, and ended up paying my own shipping and having it returned. I CANNOT find a replacement keyboard for it anywhere including ASUS!  DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND NEVER BUY AN ASUS LAPTOP!
Trust in the company work  Not one dam thing
Battery life  I have purchased a Y50-UHD a week ago.  Watched Youtube videos for about 2 hours and the battery indicated it has 36min (18%) remaining started from 100%.  I have unpluged all USB connections. Also, I have put the laptop on "Power saver" mode.  How did Lenovo get 6-8 hours on a single charge?  How can a get longer battery life ?  Laptop neeeds long battery life !!!
Finally Got It....  I recently received this laptop and I thought I would like it a lot. It comes with everything it says it would, but then I discovered the battery life is horrible. It only lasts about 5 minutes and then says that it needs to be recharged. Apparently it has a slot for an extra battery, but I had hoped that the battery I received would work.... I would not order from this company again. It was not a pleasant purchase-return experience at all, and the re-stocking fee is ridiculous. They do not believe in full refunds for a product they were responsible for ensuring customer satisfaction. I was not satisfied at all.
I really liked my Chromebook 2 fir the three days I had it. It was quick, with an excellent display and user-friendly. This morning, after charging overnight, my Chromebook refuses to turn on or respond to a 'hard reset'
CAREFUL BEWARE  After having an HP with hinges that kept breaking, I went with them again for this laptop because the service was good. This laptop, unfortunately, just by lifting the top up, the screen broke. Seriously, by lifting the top right, apparently it is a common problem.. Of course, it is three months after warranty. I wonder if that is by design?
DOA  Computer arrived today, plugged it in and turned it on to get the blue screen of a dead computer. Got an error code at first, the it just kept restarting  Sending it back tomorrow.
had to return did not work
Hi. I bought this repaired laptop, but it give me a lots of problems. It has scratches, the wifi disappears when I close the screen and I have to restart everything so that it works again, when I watch videos on facebook the screen is constantly flashing.
Hmmm... bought it out of desperate need for a machine to get me online for job search, entertainment, and social reasons. Since have found that there's no way to hook it up to external hardware sources. Bought a Brother multi-function unit that operates wirelessly, but it now that needs a firmware update that can't be established using this machine, so I can't print. I spent hours learning to use the Pixlr image software, but now it's so different I don't know how to work a downloaded photo anymore. May be a fine peripheral, but as a main computer I find I would like to bust it in half, as I don't approach every simple task willing to invest a lot of time in re-learning everything. This is total B.S. I will get a real computer as soon as I can. Oh, but it is lightweight, the battery is good and the brightness control is at hand.
Stay away from this laptop and/or OS (Windows10)  I have had this laptop for about 10 days and it has crashed on me twice as well as every time I start it in the morning (either from "sleep" or power on), the system says disk is at 100%, making the system run extremely slow.  It completely crashed within 6 weeks.  I lost data files.  I am trying to get my money back, but HP is not very helpful.  DON"T BUY THIS PRODUCT.
No AC Adapter  Laptop is good but cam with no AC Adapter.  Who sells a laptop with no adapter???
Another hinge bites the dust  I will start by saying that this laptop is close to perfection on paper excellent; the performance is really up to the highest standards, and I haven't been able to find anything close to this with a discrete GPU on such a slim and light laptop.  My daily tasks consists on Matlab and other numerical simulations programs, web surfing, movies and occasional gaming (lately MGS V, but also Assassin's Creed and other relatively demanding games). It does run hot in this but if you use a laptop cooler the temperature will be well regulated because of the aluminium body. Don't expect to run all games at QHD but usually mid-high settings at 1600*900 will give you a very decent framerate.  The yellow color is a bit off (very mustard like) but a patch widely available on forums will fix the issue at 90% and you'll be able to enjoy your laptop without noticing this issue. I wouldn't recommend photoshop users to buy the QHD version though because of this specific issue. Just go with the Full HD (ux303LA) if you don't care about not having a discrete GPU, otherwise try to get a German version of the LN with an FHD matte non-touch screen.  Here is when it goes really wrong; I bought thislaptop on August 26th. I took very good care of it, no fall, nor any damage of the sort. After 8 months of usage (guess I'm lucky it lasted more than the average 5 months), I noticed some cracking sound coming from the hinge. The screen was being wobbly as the hinge got looser too. Today as I was gently opening the lid, the hinge completely cracked out of the laptop. Unacceptable for 1K+ $ laptop. The customer service is even more incompetent.  I finally got it fixed (they replaced the screen), but this issue has been affecting a ridiculously amount of users to suggest it is a default in the design in all of their ux303 (actually all of their zenbooks, ux31, ux32 and ux303). You shouldn't have to deal with this after spending this amount of money on a so called high quality laptop.  tl;dr : I would recommend avoiding this laptop because your hinge will break after 8 months.
We received the laptop and then could not use the on board mouse.  After many hours of effort and a useless outreach to HP Support we had to download a new DRIVER so the mouse would work.  What kind of quality control do you have HP?? Bad experience
It's worst laptop I had!
Samsungs are the worst laptops you can buy  I bought this laptop through Bestbuy.  This Samsung product is terrible.  It's been re-imaged 2 times.  Now I have a message that my hard drive is failing.  Never again on a Samsung product (Bestbuy never again too). This laptop doesn't deserve one star.  I ended up buying a Mac from Amazon - TOTALLY HAPPY.
Do not buy  I have been using this laptop for about six months and I am annoyed by it.  What I don't like: * Non-removable battery * No "Pause Break" button * Win10   ** Even though the hardware is quite modern and powerful Win10 laags   ** After "Anniversary update" Win10 became painfully slow AND I started to get freezes (only restart would help). I had to roll back the update to make laptop usable * Not suitable for Linux (Debian, Ubuntu): sleep mode doesn't work (it freezes instead), difficulties with setting video drivers, etc. * Surface collects fingerprints and always looks greasy  For the first couple of months the laptop would occasionally blink and Intel video driver would report crash but the problem disappeared at some point probably due to silent updates but that was annoying and I didn't expect that from newly bought laptop with all recent updates installed.  Horror story. Once the keyboard just stopped responding while I was typing something in browser's search box. Mouse continued to work so I decided to reboot. It went into "Rebooting" state and remained there. I tried to long press power button to shut it down but power button was not powerful enough and didn't work. So, as it was still working on reboot. I had to use a screwdriver (hello non-removable battery) to open back panel and unplug battery cable. After I plugged the battery cable back in and started the laptop it started with no issues but it was a horrific experience.  I guess many of the issues are not DELL's fault but Microsoft's, Intel's, or NVidia's but anyways they all should be ashamed and go bankruptcy for what products they made.
dont buy this computer  DONT BUY THIS COMPUTER , AFTER 2 DAYS THE COMPUTER DID NOT TURN ON , I LIVE IN BRAZIL AND I DONT HAVE WARRANTY FROM ASUS HERE , I EXPENDED us 1400,00 TROW WAY , LIKE TRASH. ASUS DONT CARE , AMAZON DONT CARE.  DONT BUY !!!! , AFTER I BOUGHT I SAW I LOT OF REVIEWS IN OTHER WEBSITES ABOUT THIS TRASH COMPUTER MANY OF THE WONT TURN ON .
Disappointed  The computer ran great but the speakers were terrible!  I would not recommend this to others as there are better products out there for less money and better sound quality.
Sucks very glichey and slow
Failure  I bought my Sony Vaio 9 months ago with an extended warranty. It worked well for 6 months until one day the speakers completely died on me. I have spent the next 3 months trying to get Sony to repair the laptop for me. I spent the first month just on the phone, trying to convince tech support that my computer had had a hard drive failure. Over the next month-and-a-half they had three appointments where they sent people over to repair my computer. The first time they replaced the speakers, the second time they replaced the motherboard and the third time they replaced the sound card. All three attempts were unsuccessful; the sound still did not work. My computer is now at a repair center. I have no computer (I had to borrow someone else's computer to write this review). This is my experience with Sony Vaio. Maybe you'll have a better one. Who knows?
Never work  The computer had problem during initiation.  I try to reset.  But I couldn't do it either.  I wasted 6 hrs.
awful experience  The only reason why I purchased this laptop is to run some reloading applications on my bench and eventually see some youtube videos. Well the combo between this laptop ,Windows 10, light browsing is so awful that I would rather use my phone for most of the stuff.
Does not come with Microsoft Office or way to install CDs!  Recently got this, mostly just to use for work for paperwork. Found out too late that it doesn't even come with Microsoft Office which I desperately need and no way to install cds. Total rip off, I'm really disappointed that I now I have to spend so much money to buy Microsoft Office. Do not buy this laptop if you actually need it for anything besides the internet!
Do not buy, looks good but works like crap. Bad customer service, sent repair 3 times and still not fixed. 2 month repair total.  This is my story. I bought this laptop a year ago and I had issues with it from the start. As soon as I got the computer the touchscreen would click by itself. I needed the computer for business so I just disabled the touchscreen and I used it without the touch for over 6 months. The base is made from Aluminum but the plastic screen is very sensitive and fragile. The joints are easy to break and if you pick up the laptop the wrong way with one hand you can possibly break the screen. This is definitely not like a MacBook, it looks cool but not high quality. The sound is really bad, it has something called SonicMaster but my iPhone is louder than my laptop. That is what I think about the laptop, now here is what I think about ASUS. After using the laptop for 6 months I finally had no choice but to send it to Asus for repair. I sent the laptop to have the sound and touchscreen and sound fixed THREE TIMES. (1st Repair) They took ONE MONTH and changed the following: New screen, new motherboard, new CD-ROM, new processor. When I got the laptop back the touchscreen was not fixed although they replaced the screen, my windows key was wrong so I had to reformat myself and fix the key by calling Microsoft. (2nd REPAIR) I sent the laptop back to Asus to fix the touchscreen, sound and mouse pad. This took 3 weeks and when I got the laptop back the touchscreen worked for one week and stopped working again, they also did not fix the mouse pad or sound. (3rd REPAIR) I finally sent it in again and they had it for 2 weeks and finally fixed the touchscreen, they did not fix the mouse pad or the sound. I finally gave up, they wouldnt give me a new computer and I got tired of sending it in. They had my laptop for over 2 months total. I am typing this on the laptop that has the sound and mouse issue.  DO NOT BUY this, looks good but is built like crap, they should have done it right. The customer service is nice but all they do is try to fix it over and over until you get tired and stop sending it to them. Bad design and weak frame.  I gave it a one star because it hasn't died and I am still using it after a year.
I have to say, I was really loving it but its battery blew up in the first week, so I sent it back
Extremely slow
Lemon by design?  I am writing this review on my iPad because, as usual, my MacBook Air will not connect to the Internet (a known issue with the Lion OS). Then there are the keys that constantly come off -- by design! Yes, easy enough fix (unless you have poor vision and arthritis as I do), but why should I have to do this on a weekly basis for an $1100 "high-end" lap top? Finally, that famous battery life? Haven't seen it. Another known issue with Lion OS. Reportedly there are fixes for the battery and Internet issues, but for this to be a common problem for such an expensive "net book" (really, that is what the memory and processor amount to), leaves me with no choice but to give it two stars. (edited to add - see my comment below for fixes on wifi and keys)  Same mac, new problem (August 9, 2013) -- twice I have lost all ability to input via my built in touchpad or mouse. Only way to turn it off is a hard reboot (i.e. holding the power button until it shuts off) AND the problem still exists even after the reboot. The only way I've resolved it is that I have a standalone touchpad (nowhere near it at the time the malfunction arises) that it will recognize despite the malfunction and the bluetooth was on (else the standalone touchpad would be pointless). Then I can shut it off using the standalone touchpad and the issue is resolved when I turn it back on.
Junk  Dirty, used hard.  Computer has been wet, shows corrosion all over.  Poor refurb
Terrible, terrible keyboard. TERRIBLE.  PROs: The laptop loads fast, has a great battery length, and it's lightweight with quite a few hardware features (dvd drive, 3.0 usb hub) I wouldn't have expected on a budget laptop. The actual layout of the keyboard is fine; it doesn't feel cramped in the least.  CONs: the keyboard and mouse track pad are the worst I have ever worked with. The keys are totally non-responsive. They literally just stop working. I haven't found any kind of work around with the exception of buying a usb/bluetooth keyboard. Seriously. It is that bad. The trackpad doesn't respond consistently. For example, I'll click on a menu and move the mouse to select an item, and the menu will close as if I clicked out. Doesn't make any sense at all. It's taken me four times as long as it should to write this review. If it wasn't for the keyboard and trackpad, I would have given this laptop 5 stars, but since 98% of a laptop's functionality depends on a keyboard that flipping lets you type...this thing is going back.  TL;DR all the keyboard/trackad reviews are accurate. Don't waste your money.
Dissapointment.  The machine I received had the battery detached on arrival with some kind of crumbs from food in the battery compartment. The left and right mousepad buttons worked intermittently or not at all. It was already set up to windows 10 despite being advertised as windows 7. It was also very slow to respond when the mousepad did work. I'm very curious to know what "certified refurbished" means because it's pretty clear this device was never tested.  Will contact seller for replacement and amend this review if a working machine is received.
DO NOT BUY  after a month the computer die
Not so good  I've had this laptop for almost 18 months now.  You get what you pay for I guess. Oh yeah, uninstall the Norton they have on here. It's terrible and causes the whole system to run slow. At the 6 month mark, the LCD cracked....of course that isn't covered under the 1 year warranty.  After 9 months the battery stopped holding a charge.  I get about 10 minutes on a battery charge now. You have to leave this plugged in at all times.  Oh, and after about a year, the charger died so I had to get a universal charger.  So, I initially purchased the laptop for around $400 and spent another $200 on a new LCD and then another $60 on a universal lap top charger.  And the battery still doesn't hold a charge.  Avoid this one if you can.
AVOID AT ALL POSSIBLE CASE  waste of money. its processing speed is slow. the speakers started frying in less than two weeks. like ill have to trash This and get a good laptop.
Freezes constantly  I got this laptop less than two months ago. The laptop freezes at least once an hour which makes it basically unusable. I just got this thing and it feels like a 5 yer old lap top with all sorts of issues. The battery life is really bad for a new laptop as well. Overall incredibly upset with my purchase.  ***Update I sent it in to Asus. I got it back about 2 weeks later and guess what....it still freezes and crashes causing me to lose progress on my work. DO NOT BUY THIS.
My Commodore 64 keyboard worked better  This is a lovely computer that I received early September 2012. Except for the critical fact that after 2 weeks, some of the keyboard keys are intermittently failing to register: the C, the K, the Q, and the space bar. I emailed Asus support about 12 hours ago so hopefully I'll hear back from them soon. Why ruin a lovely computer with such a basic failing?!?! I want to keep this computer, but cannot if this continues. (Yes, for some reason the keys are working now as I type this, but they often weren't working for the previous 2 days.)
Damaged product  I bought a laptop that was damaged when I got it.
I had to send this back, because for the money, it wasn't what I expected it to be as far as the design feature. Just some internal design functionality features that I am used to and expected to see on this laptop wasn't to be. It's also so big and heavy still that I found a tablet was more my flavor.
Delivered with bad drivers needs to be rebooted constantly windows 10 has problem loading and has to be restarted losing all apps then I have to reload the apps
Three Stars  This is bulls*** the mirocsoft 265 office expires so I try do it the day before and doesn't even work at all I have to buy it
Wouldn't boot up, wouldn't shut down. Had to send back.
Not "practically indestructiblle" as Lenovo claims.  There must be a manufacturer defect.  Light and fast, but the plastic frame is cheap, not built not "practically indestructible" as they claim on their website.  We've had this laptop for 2 months and there is a 2 inch crack on the outer right upper corner of the lid.  This computer has been taken care of , with no drops or other accidents, and am can't think of how this crack developed other than that is the corner we touch to pull down the lid when we close the computer.  There has to be some type of manufacturer defect for this to happen.  We called tech support and they will not cover this crack under warranty.  So much for standing behind their "practically indestructible"  "military-grade" components.
Run Away!  This is by FAR the worst computer if not the worst computing device I've ever touched.  It's slow. It's buggy. The interface is clumsy and tortuous. It crashes programs.  I've never had to send a computer back to the manufacturer for repairs before...that is, until I owned this ASUS. It came back to me with a $150 bill and it STILL sucks. Run away! Run away!  Save yourself pain, suffering and mental anguish...get a Mac.
Don't buy this laptop  The combination of Lenovo and Microsoft Windows 8 is terrible. This thing has so many annoy issues there are just too many to go into. This is my third laptop and I used (retired) computers at work extensively. This is the worst machine I've ever encountered. Do yourself a favor and buy a different brand. Wanted to give Lenovo a try, big mistake.  Update-in less than 3 months the body of this laptop is falling apart. The screws on the bottom were constantly falling out. Now the right corner of the body is separating and it appears the threads of the nearest screw have stripped. So now when you open the top the body separates near the right hinge. Please save yourself the anxiety of owning this piece of junk, buy anything else.
Computer done after only three months!!!!!!!  Just received this computer on February 28.  It was really slow but eventually got a little better.  Yesterdat, June 9, the screen went black.  I shut it down for the night.  Today I got the screen back then without notice the screen went black and it hasn't come back on.  I'm writing on my tablet and could not be angrier.  Then I find out the return policy is only 30 days, when it was workin fine.  I have no recourse but to spend my own money to fix it and I'm hoping it can be fixed.  Beyond Tech is the seller....beware! .
I wouldn't recommend.  After updating drivers and reinstallations, I still have issues with the sound & video... I wouldn't recommend.
Excellent buy in 2016, new updated ASUS laptop, with one paper cut of a problem  This is a great computer for the price. It is thin, light, stylish. It has an intel processor which is comparable to the i3. The new style of USB port and the SSD/Flash Memory drive really seal the deal that this is a new cutting edge budget laptop. The desktop comes completely clean, not filled with shortcuts for programs you'll never use and there is very little if any bloatware. There is no CD drive, but these days for the most part you shouldn't need one (everything is becoming digital download).  The keyboard is fantastic, I love the feel of it, and it feels nice to type on. Except for one major thing I cannot get over. I hate to deduct 3 stars for this, but it is something that needs to work properly on a productivity laptop, especially if you are a college student writing papers. The spacebar needs to be hit directly in the center and cannot be hit softly. It is as if the same key size was used for the spacebar as all the other alphabet keys, so that you must hit the space bar right in the spot where the key is located underneath. This means you cannot hit the spacebar on the left side, or the right side, but only directly in the center. I had read a review of another person having an issue with the spacebar on his Asus laptop of a different type. I am pretty disappointed I seem to have the same spacebar problem. It is possible to get the spacebar to work by striking it anywhere, but it has to be hit harder than I usually type. Every other key can be pressed gently and softly and it works perfectly, the space bar is the only key that requires a particular way in which it must be hit. This problem may seem minor, and it may seem harsh to deduct 3 stars over it, but when it is something like the spacebar that is used so frequently in almost any task performed on the laptop, it is a real bummer and constant reminder of something that is not working properly that should. I am not sure if they are using used parts in new laptops, or if it is a design flaw, or if mine and a few others just aren't working correctly.  I spent a lot of time shopping for a budget laptop and I was very excited for this new machine, but in the end basic things like the spacebar need to work as they do normally on any other machine, and like the other keys on the keyboard. Whenever I hit the spacebar I don't want to think about if I am going to hit it in just the right way or not.  As long as I hit it like all the other keys it should work, no thinking, just typing.  If you google "Asus laptop spacebar problem" you will find videos and information on people with the exact problem I am having. The problem existed right out of the box, like the other people I have found with the same problem.
Expected more from Dell  The delivery, packaging was all spot on. The laptop was good looking, Nice design but a tad heavy. Everything worked well for a few weeks but afterwards I started hearing sounds from inside the laptop and it was not the fan, the display driver crashed everytime out of no where. Then there came the performance issues. I was lucky it happened within 30 days so I was able to return it.
Not the worth the money  I thought it would do more for the money I paid. This product is not user friendly like apple.
POOR  HEAVY, CHUNKY, UGLY DESIGN, IT STOPPED TURNING ON AFTER JUST 2 WEEKS.
Terrible life. 17 months and it is GONE  Purchased 7/19/16; mother board DIED 12/8/17. Terrible life. 17 months and it is GONE!
Poor Customer Service  If you purchase this computer because you think it will qualify for the Windows 7 Upgrade Option you are mistaken!! I purchased it, and subsequently returned it, because it does not qualify for the option. I received written confirmation from Microsoft and verbal confirmation from Amazon that it would qualify, but Gateway did not want to play ball. I tried calling Gateway and was told that the T-68 models do not qualify. There is no conscionable reason for it not to qualify other than that Gateway does not see the need to provide minimum customer service to their customers. I do not recommend purchasing from Gateway. Also, for those of you that are bothered by this - customer service representatives at Gateway do not speak English as a first language!  I admit the computer works fine. Cons: Screen resolution is max 1200 X 800ish. I would have hoped for better. The speakers are weak and not the clearest. The CD/DVD drive is a little flimsy.
Do NOT Buy This Please  Ok first let me say that I bought this in May, and for the six months I was happy (even mildly so with Windows 8). But it has become an extremely expensive paperweight. Out of the blue, it will not start up properly, rendering the entire computer inoperable. I had never downloaded anything other than Office and I don't do any possibly harmful web surfing, so this is not a malware issue. It is an issue with the hardware, specifically the processor, according to the error message. I have also found MANY others with the same issue in some online forums. Upon sifting through the tireless maze that HP calls "Customer Support and Warranty Claims" I was finally able to put in a claim but was told the next day this product is not supported!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My only options are the online tech chat, which is laughable at best. So I am about to toss this in the trash, I have bought a MacBook Air and will never look back. If you're stuck on Windows (as I was until now) look at another brand and save yourself some future hassle and disappointment
Si laptop era usada  No me agrado que parece haber sido utilizada la laptop, algunas partes estn desgastadas.
it didn't work sent it back.
Worst gaming laptop I've ever owned.  I've never had so many problems with a laptop. This is the last MSI I buy. Normally I go with ASUS - but I got a bit burnt on my last ASUS 17 inch since it throttle agressively and I figured I'd try MSI. Bad, bad mistake. The charge port is trash, absolute trash. Had to replace that at cost with a local repair shop, because MSI RMA service can take 1-3 months, which is absolutely insane. The bluetooth died one day. No solution. Third: the screen has discooloration for no reason all around it. There is a SUPER obnoxious "share video kek!!!ol" button that cannot be disabled. I'm tempted to disassemble the f-ing keyboard to take the button out entirely. The keyboard "colors" are cool but sometimes when closing the lid it truggers that button then it starts cycling rainbow colors for no reason - very annoying, and god for bid I hit the wrong button and it tries to STREAM VIDEO KEK!  The only pro is that it's VERY easy to disassemble to clean the fan ports, which do clog up VERY fast... that's basically necessary with this model with the fan/heatsink design.  If I could go back in time, I'd pay an extra $500 for an ASUS or HP than this P. O. S. :)
Wireless stop working  Wireless stop working. Chatting online with HP, he said it will cost about $300 if warranty is expired. HP has not recalled for this model but others of HP pavillion some has been recalled. Wish more people have the same problem on this model and we can issue this to HP.
DO NOT BUY!!  DO NOT BUY!! Piece of crap was a bootleg pc and never worked!!!! DO NOT BUY!!
Great lap top but very short life span.
review for purchasing a refurbished one.... this has not worked correctly since we purchased it and now with in the year the hard drive has failed. read all reviews.  i did read some that there was a problem with some of the updates, and There was.
returned it
I don't know why my PC came in such a bad shape, it might not be always, but sincerely I wouldn't buy it if I were you.  From the beginning, it had like a strange stuttering every few seconds in the screen, I updated the drivers like 10 times, reinstalled everything, but nothing seemed to work. But I didn't have enough time to do something about it, and the problem wasn't that bad, so I just ignored it and continued to use it in college works and things like that, nothing heavy. Then the speakers started to sound awful, and now I just can't keep it. The real problem here is that I live in Costa Rica, and there's no shipping back to Costa Ria, so it'll have to go from here to repair and then make a stop at my friend's house who lives in texas, and then i'll have to pay the shipment back here to Costa Rica, it's just awful; and the worst part is that I'll be needing my PC to work on college things all that time. Also, I checked on dell's webpage and it appears that shipping was made on October 07, 2016. And I bought it beginning this year, it's just wrong, don't buy it.
Cheap laptop  Son received for a Christmas present and 6 hours after receiving it the laptop stop working, called Amazon and not much help other than returning it and receive a refun in 3 to 14 days joy joy joy.
No operating system.  Turned on, no chrome os! How can it be tested before sold if there is no operating system on the machine?!
Freezing, audio problems.  It was awesome when I first bought it.  But just two years later, I have to suffer its constant propensity to freeze up; I have to wait for it to work out whatever the hell it needs to in order to continue web-surfing.  And now, the audio is having problems.  Don't buy one of these.
Good used price deal but description was Win 7 Pro and received Win 8.1 Pro. Returned it as I wanted Win7. Not sure how they keep software version sorted when pulling item. They should have Config Version Stickers visible on outside of box and removable version sticker on laptop itself. Disappointed as I was expecting to get started tinkering with laptop. Pain in the ass have to deal with delayed delivery and refund dance. All the technology in the world and we can't make simple label fixes that end up costing everyone more time/$$ in the long run with the "inconvenience."
I don't want to jump thru hoop's to return tho I wish to .It shuts down by its self with a full charge or charging HP please help if you want to Thank you, Sammy
Bluetooth and wifi issues when used simultaneously. Keyboard could have more colors.
Worst support ever for a lemon  Worst computer I ever bought, a complete lemon.  After having it for three weeks, it blue screened with memory and video card problems.  I sent it back to Asus to be repaired (they would not replace it).  Asus did not return it to me FOR FOUR WEEKS, USING UPS GROUND SHIPPING to return it.  UPS Ground somehow took three weeks itself.   After receiving it back, within another month it started blue screening repeatedly again.  Upon calling Asus support again, they told me to open a ticket and send it back to them, again.  When I told them I use it for work (in software development) and couldn't afford to be without it for four weeks again, they had no response.   Buy anything but this.  Zero stars.   One last note.  As I was writing this review on my Zenbook, it blue screened again.
It runs fine and functions  Meh.  The screen on this is very dark, and visible only if you're directly in front of it.  My daughter uses it, but I'd probably go insane if it were mine.  It runs fine and functions, and she is content to use it.  But if you're buying it for an adult, I'd pass.
Hard drive went out after 2 months  I bought this machine 2 months ago from acer's website. My hard drive went out last night and now I have to send it in to acer at my own expense to have it repaired. I have read more reviews on acer and found many people having trouble with customer service. I am just hoping they will honor my warranty as I have read reviews that their warranty is basically non existent.
I relied on HP brand and bought this notebook, but it was not a good choice. He came with a scratch on the screen that appears every time the screen is white background. I live in Brazil and I can not return. Disappointing.
Anger sharks are swimming! Steer clear of this one.  Steer clear if you can't deal well with frustration.  Trackpad is awful and bluetooth is sometimes there, sometimes not. Requires restart often to get the machine to operate properly.  Not a fan at all.
Worked ok for a year  Obviously  many people here have problems with wi-fi connection on this computer after 6 months of using. So do i, after re installing  drivers and trying to solve this problem, i gave up as the problem is computer itself, now i just have to wait until it dies and buy a new NOT HP laptop. The wi-fi goes on and off, so sometimes i have to connect to the ethernet cable directly, might as well have a desktop. All other 'cool' feature like backlit keyboard don't even matter anymore. Very disappointing, good thing i bought it on sale for 550$. Do not waste your  money!
Just don't  This laptop sucks. It's really slow. Constantly freezes. It's basicaly useless!
First one had trouble booting up. I had to reset to factory settings after having set it up. Replacement won't run on battery. I'm getting a refund.
Didn't Work!  Microsoft Office is not pre-installed as indicated by the product description and the DVD/CDROM did not work. Maybe the last part was a good thing, because it would have been weeks, maybe months before I would have had to use the DVD drive.
Disappointing  This machine met all expectations for thin and light but it started to fail on functionality, especially when we found it couldn't connect to a printer without that printer being found in the cloud and the printer is too old apparently( at only 2 years!) to operate that way.  Also we couldn't run Skype on it.  Apparently there is some work-around but it is too complex for us to implement.  We will keep it for activities that don't require printing or Skype but we are disappointed with this purchase.
computer constantly crashes  This computer constantly crashes when just trying to update windows the computer its self is good but I believe the one received by deal fisher is defective please send a new one
Plug in a cell phone in the USB port and it crashes??!!  This was a replacement for an HP DM1-z which was faulty and returned to HP. The Aspire was a bit faster but graphics were a little slower. I have experienced occasional crashes and blue screens for no apparent reason. I finally got all my software installed, plugged in my Motorola Droid and the computer froze. Pulled the battery and tried an HTC Droid...same thing. It will not even get paste the Acer boot screen if a cell phone is plugged into a USB port.  Acer tech support is a bad joke. They refused to provide me with any support because it was a possible software problem. (Bios). They said I could pay for tech support...I said CYA! Acer. It goes back to my vendor tomorrow. Shame on you Acer! I would not take an Acer product if it was handed to me after this experience.
great til it breaks  first off, amazon only gives you 30 days to return this product, so if anything happens after that, goo luck replacing it.  second, the 'warranty' on this compute doesn't cover any sort of damages or replacements. the screen cracked while i was opening the chromebook, which was irritating enough. i called customer service to ask how to go about fixing it and was told that the 1 year limited warranty only covered replacement of missing parts. when i aske how much it costs to fix the screen, i was surprised to find that it was $199 plus tax, so essentially the same price hat was paid fo the computer in the first place. how does that make any sense? so not only can i not return it, but its not even worth fixing it. i hope it can at least be recycled b/c the last thing i want to do is contribute to the terrible e-waster pandemic.  it works great, espcially for the pric, and the audio is fantstico, but if you forsee a drop or crack, get something sturdier and with a better warranty. i've had it for a month and a half
Terrible product!!!  Warranty is for 1 year. One month after the one year mark the damn thing crashed and the hard drive died. Called Sony customer service to see if they can help. They offered charging me $300 to fix it. How convenient it is to die right after warranty expires. I only use this laptop for web search and MS Office. Last time I will buy a Sony product!!! I've never had a laptop breakdown so quickly.
not worth it  Want to return it
Sucks  Update will take all the storage then the pc is useless. Crap i wish i can return it.
Bad Technical Support  This is not a recommendable product. The global support is very deficient, my laptop has problems with the Wi-Fi and I still waiting for the technical support answer since two weeks ago. If you can do it, choose other brand or model.
It has twice the pixels as my desktop PC however it feels like less desktop real estate available  There is something "weird" about the graphics card / display of this laptop. It has twice the pixels as my desktop PC however it feels like less desktop real estate available. Icons were not proportionate and i had to manipulate windows font and icon settings in the control panel to try to get them closer to normal. It even messes up Firefox and Adobe Flash Player. Elements within a Flash applet are shrunk to half the size while the applet over all size (outline) is full size. So it creates a full sized box where the applet is, but the controls, graphics, buttons, etc are half size only filling part of the applet box leaving a large blacked out area. The icons in the start menu are 1/3 normal size. Its just all "weird".  However, if you don't care about the size of desktop and start menu icons, nor about flash applets, everything else about the laptop is great. I love the size and feel. Its slim, sleek, sexy. Touch screen works fine, although i don't believe laptops need to be touch screen. I took it outside on a sunny afternoon and could still read the screen. Not as bright mind you but still visible. Battery seems to be good, no complaints from me.
Good Computer, But Breaks Too Easily  While I generally love this computer when it's working, the problem with it is that it often ISN'T working. My computer broke in less than a year of owning it and customer support was TERRIBLE. They wanted to charge me $2/minute to talk with them!  Plus, the laptop was packaged with the utterly useless and rather annoying empowerment technology that seemed to do nothing but slow down the computer.  Save your money and find a brand that creates a laptop less prone to breaking and is more willing to help you if your computer does break.
Crippled processor  Let me explain up front I am probably not the most typical laptop user. If your goal is to use a word processor and some spreadsheets this laptop is probably fine but you could do as well with a less expensive alternative. I travel and I need multiple operating systems available so I use virtual machines. I got this laptop for that purpose because of the AMD A10 processor which is powerful enough and has hardware virtualization extensions built in, plus theres plenty of hard drive space for multiple virtual machines to be installed. I installed Virtualbox and got an error that the AMD-V extensions were turned off in the BIOS. This is not uncommon with a new machine, normally you just go to the BIOS and turn them on. I could not find such settings in the BIOS. I called Toshiba support and spent 2 hours on the phone with them telling me to try various things before they admitted the virtualization extensions could not be turned on with no explanation as to why (but obviously its been left out of the BIOS). Additionally by the time I hung up with support the laptop would no longer boot Windows. The support experience was a mixed bag. I was passed around to various techs during the call. To their credit they were pleasant and well spoken. However, they do not seem to have any technical knowledge beyond the is it turned on point, even when I was bumped up to level 2 support they were grasping at straws. There were multiple attempts to snow me by telling me various stories like: 1. Windows can not run virtual machines (technically true but I was using Virtualbox so False); 2. I need a Pro version of Windows to run virtual machines (False); 3. Windows would turn on the hardware extensions but only if it was a Pro version (laughably false); 4. One tech asked me why I would want to turn on these extensions after I had already explained about running virtual machines; 5. One tech put me on hold and came back asking me what kind of virtual projector I was trying to install (no comment at all on this one). In the end the final person I spoke with told me, in a not very pleasant tone, that the laptop does not support turning on any hardware extensions in the processor. So Im returning the laptop (thank you Newegg for making that easy).  Pros: Very good configuration of HDD, RAM and processor for the price. Lighted keyboard. Bright screen. Support is easy to reach with no long waits. Cons: Only partial support for the AMD A10 processor which leaves it crippled. The shiny screen makes a considerable amount of reflected glare (probably a personal preference). Support was either clueless or just trying to snow me. In either case it shouldnt have taken 2 hours to come to the conclusion that the BIOS does not support the full capabilities of the AMD processor. I did not check but Im assuming there are numerous other hardware settings that are unavailable in the BIOS. Even the Advanced tab in the BIOS had minimal settings available.  Conclusion: I don't think Toshiba should sell a laptop without disclosing up front that they do not fully support the processor capabilities. I can not think of any reason, technical or marketing, that would justify crippling the processor this way. The drawn out support call and the considerable misinformation they tried to give me leaves little respect for support in general. Having quick access to support is great but if they cant help you its useless. I would not recommend this machine to anyone and I do not intend to consider Toshiba in the future.
Broken Hinge. The plastic part that the hinge attached was thin, and broken easily. Now I see many people had the similar problems with ASUS laptop.
Unfortunately I had a bad experience with Eagle Express because the laptop came with a defect. Since I noticed the defect, I sent a lot of emails with doubts to Eagle Express that are not clear enough on Amazon.com and even after they have received the faulty computer, they not answered me absolutely nothing. I was very frustrated, even more because I have no computer and I'm needing a as fast as possible.
Just Say No!  Bottom line? ANY sub $300 Windows laptop will blow this Chromebook out of the water. Period.
midle of keyboard has pop up .. is that only i received one or all product have same problem?
Recovery Issues  I had a lot of trouble upgrading from XP Home that came bundled with my FRV37 to XP Professional. I had to do a fresh installation of XP Pro that formatted my machine. This also resulted in loosing all of the preloaded software. I just ordered for a set of Recovery DVD's from sony for $35. I fail to understand why Sony wants to save on recovery CDs... Customers beware!!! Do not try updrading the machine to XP Professional. Sony does not support it.
So slow. It freezes often. Cant do basic functions.
Waste of time  It worked great until I couldn't charge the battery. At that point it became pretty much useless. I researched a few fixes, most relating to a Microsoft battery driver; didn't work. Followed the fix and still had the same problem. As I needed this for field work and didn't have the time to mess around, I was forced to buy a second notebook. Be assured it wasn't a Lenovo.
Worth the price?????  If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything....  On the plus side, great battery life, light, and OS that is pretty OK.  On the really negative side, died 8 days after warranty expired.  No power, no nothing. Off to apple repair. Locked into RAM and everything else.  Very little is user accessible. VERY EXPENSIVE TO BUY AND OWN.  Think long and hard before you invest.  UPDATE:  I took my Mac to the local apple store.  They fixed it under the warranty even though it was 8 days out.  Thanks Apple for doing the right thing.
These reviews are bologna  If you read through the reviews for all of the other Sony Vaio's you'll see that they each have 4 out of five stars and say exactly the same thing for each one. It' obvious someone is being paid to leave positive reviews here...next time be more creative!
Touch typist misery  There is much to like about this laptop. Here's why I want to throw it out the window every time I use it. I am a touch typist. The touchcpad on this laptop is too big. The heels of my thumbs touch it while I type, so my computer is always doing surprising things as I type, like moving the cursor around, deleting sentences and paragraphs, and other aggravating things. I go from 80 words / minute to about 10 after having to constantly fix what I've already typed. I hate my laptop. Also, my laptop is terrible with holding onto an Internet connection. I spend lots of time now working in the lunch room because I can maintain an Internet connection there. My office is now just a place to hang my coat. (My netbook, old laptop, and iPad have none of the connection issues this laptop has -- in the office, at home, in hotels, in coffee shops.) BTW, I have a Dell 15" XPS laptop. What exactly other identification numbers to with it, I have no idea. In regard to the problem noted above, I have had to fix this review four times while typing. I think I will put duct tape over the touchpad to see if that fixes the problem. I'm serious.
Owned the thing for just over a 1 year and the hinges broke off, the Bluetooth connection never worked correctly, and the wifi doesn't work. It is a POS. If you see in the picture I had to take the screen off, and it says no wifi connections, it also gives me an audio driver issue to the point the computer doesn't play sound. I have done factory resets and everything and still nothing works. Currently using this as a desktop.
Slow.  Had to take virus protector off and add another. It's a pain
Completely overrated.  I've had this product for about a week now. I have no idea how this thing has gotten the mostly positive reviews that it's gotten on this site. I understand that it only costs 250, but the thing feels like a cheap toy. It's made of plastic, the screen is terrible and it slower that I thought it would be given the processor that is in it. Even surfing normal websites can bog the thing down. Watching videos/movies is not as smooth at it should be. The keyboard is not bad, but it looks to be made for hobbits...it's too small.  Even though it only costs 249.00 I simply can not justify having this product. I'd be willing to spend a couple of hundred bucks more to get something that is quality. If I simply need to surf the web then I will use my smart phone and use my computer at home or at the office.
Awful experience Terrible support from HP  This was a 350 dollar mistake below is what I sent to HP support on this.  When I did the online support I still had 13 days left on the warranty they were rude and unhelpful not to mention they misunderstood what I was typing. This design would fail if the ethernet port was used for very long because it's made of soft plastic and the hold clip wear out fairly quickly. I'm guessing that HP figured most people don't use the ethernet hard connection much anymore which is true but this HP came with a cheap wireless card that didn't have very good throughput. I've only plugged into the ethernet port maybe 20 times the cable I used maybe had a hundred uses on several devices beside the HP computer. When I told them I've used the cable maybe one hundred times they immediately voided the warranty and said it was from abuse or at least eluded to that and it almost seemed like because I used the ethernet port it voided the warranty. This was unacceptable resolution so I called to talk to a agent that didn't speak english very well. At the end of this conversation it was agreed that HP would honor the warranty and a box would be sent out to send the computer back. This hasn't happened. I've bought HP computers for years but this was the first time I bought an internet special from best buy unseen. This was a mistake on my part because the quality of this unit is sub standard. This is the cheapest HP I've ever bought and figure at this price point you can't get anything that is constructed with decent quality standards. Because of how HP handled this situation I will no longer buy HP but I'm sure that doesn't matter to HP because you still have plenty of customers for now. I'm sure you get plenty of complaints but I will just go away after I file a compliant with the BBB and go with one of the many other brands of computers available.
unfortunately this laptop came with a keypad trouble stuck where the letter J, so it is often in an instant the touch pad does not work, and problems with my company sent me Liberty Express get me after 4 months of being purchased, and the guarantee only covers in USA and I am from Venezuela. I've always had Dell Laptop brand and have fascinated me, but this is the exception. I hope I can help the Supplier
Asus advertisers that its water resistant. UNTRUE!!  I purchased this a yr ago, 5/2017 ,water splashed on it. Not spilled. Its no longer working, they told me its cover BUT NOT FOR WATER !!!  The estimated cost would be $240.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS CHROMEBOOK
need a recall - wireless stops working  I've had a tx for about two years and, a few days ago, its wireless adapter stopped working (first it became intermittent and then it stopped for good). I tried everything HP recommended: updated the BIOS, reinstalled drivers and - in complete despair - even run a "hard reset", returning the device to its original state. Then I googled a bit and found many other Pavilion owners with exact the same problem. For instance, take a look at this article [...] Things can always get worse and, when I contacted HP, they refused to provide me any assistance because I bought my laptop overseas (in Chile) - although the guy who sold it to me assured me that there would be no such restriction. So now I'm gonna have to take my laptop to an unauthorized repair center.
Great for a while but apparently disposable  This Chromebook worked really well for 379 days, which happened to be 14 days after the warranty expired.  On day 379 it stopped responding, stopped charging, stopped everything.  Save yourself some trouble and some money and purchase a higher quality computer.  The microUSB power connection seems particularly problematic, but I cannot definitely say that was the fatal issue with this machine.
This laptop is junk. The power button stopped working a few months in and was returned to Dell. It came back in exactly the same state and now hardly stays turned on.  The case is made cheaply and the battery barely sits snug in the compartment which I assume is part of the problem with it powering off.
LOUSY!
Apple Macbook Review  I did not realize it was such an old outdated model.  I paid too much for it.  I should have gotten advice from my son when I selected this product.  I knew nothing about Apple Products and I thought I was getting a good deal on it.  My son had gotten a good deal on a later model Macbook for about $300 dollars more at the commissary at his base so I thought I was getting a good deal on an up to date model like his.  When he saw it, he told me that this was one of the oldest Macbooks that they made.
Display screen went out about 2 months after warranty ended.  Had to order new one and replace myself witch cost me about $85 dollars.  Other than that the performance has been ok.
Piece of ****  Bought it about about a year ago and the battery won't charge anymore. Bought a third party charger to replace it and the charger worked for a week and now that won't charge it either.
Do not purchase an Alienware M14x R2!!!  I've been a Dell customer for over 10 years. Purchased an Alienware M14x R2 February 2013 to replace my old Alienware M11x. I loved everything about it... until a month ago. Less than 6 months after spending close to $1,700 on a top of the line gaming computer, which was extremely well taken care, it broke. During late June/early July I noticed that the left hinge was getting stuck and making a popping sound whenever the laptop was closed and/or opened. Two weeks after the noise/problem began, the left hinge popped out of place and split the case (around the screen) apart. The laptop still worked fine, however, I decided to call Dell customer service and get it fixed. It is after all a six month old laptop, that is still under warranty until 2015. Apparently I was wrong. Yes, it's under warranty. But after customer support checked it, they informed me that the repair is not covered under the warranty that I have (apparently I needed the complete customer subscription). I asked what could cause a hinge on a laptop, which is less than 6 months old, to break and was told that it was MY fault. That I mishandled the laptop and that I have to pay for them to fix it. I was also informed that there have been no complaints (at all) on the M14x hinges, however, a quick search on Google will show that this is not the case. There are hundreds of other complaints, which Dell has chosen to ignore. This is the first time that I've had problems with Dell customer service. I never expected to pay top dollar for a "quality" laptop and have it break so quickly from normal wear and tear. Do yourself a favor and do a quick search on "Alienware M14x hinge" and decided for yourself. I'm personally never again purchasing from Dell. I rather take my money and business to a retailer that listens to their customers and sells a quality product.
but probably the worst part is the connection strength  No dvd player, but probably the worst part is the connection strength. I've had two of these so far and the connection hasn't worked past a certain distance in my house. I have to be within 15 yards of my router and if I even think about taking it 30 yards the connection will simply not connect. The other laptops I've had have absolutely no trouble connecting to wifi from that distance.
Arrived Broken  Arrived on time packaging was good. The machine was DOA. MSI support was helpful but in the end it still arrived broken. Screen is dead and won't power on. Returning this unit. :(
Dissapointed  I have yet to recieve this item - so right now i am totally dissapointed. i was told that i would recieve this item by 7th NOvember  2011
Wrongly Advertised  Item name is wrong. This is the early 2011 model not the summer 2012 model. Intel HD graphics 3000 not 4000. When I turned it on and plugged in my flashdrive the USB port was not working.
Disappointed  It stopped working a year after I purchased it. Got it repaired and it is not working anymore.
Microphone unacceptable  I got this laptop so I could use Dragon Naturally Speaking as well as use Skype for audio/video conference calls. The microphone doesn't work when I plug in my headset and it's too faint when I use the front microphone, so I have to type on the conference calls and I can't use Dragon Naturally Speaking, both of which are unacceptable. In addition, when I type sometimes only a portion of the letters actually type out.
Review for Toshiba as a whole  Toshiba makes incredibly unreliable parts which fail often (this is an across the board issue on most of their products). This is especially troublesome as they try to charge you for tech support. They also do not include recovery media in their package to save the $0.01 it costs them to turn a disk. Instead they actually section off your hard drive to store the windows recovery information. This would be a good idea if their hard drives weren't notorious for being the part that dies. They will also charge you $30.00 for the recovery disk so make sure to make a recovery dvd. (I'd point out this technically means you are paying for the recovery media).
It was made for touchscreen. And it was frustrating trying to navigate it smoothly with the mouse pad... it was kind of a hassle. A little flimsy, I prefer my old trusty Acer Aspire one..
Awful service on broken screen  The latch to the screen broke after about two months and Sony made it so difficult to get it fixed. I spent weeks (not hours) trying to get it fixed under warranty. Sony did everything they could to avoid fixing the laptop.  I understand that products break but good after service is important. I will never buy a Sony product again after all of the headache and work that I had to do to get this product fixed
Not for gamers, barely for regular users  bought this about 8 months ago from walmart the 1st 3 weeks the computer ran fine and i had no issues other than i noticed it got hot fairly easily(standard acer issue) and the keyboard was stiff here and there. within the next month i decided to play some games...., when i mean games i mean skyrim and halflife2 not chess. anyway it played them fine but 1hour in to either game and the system went black from overheating, i figured it was because of using it on my lap(still don't get how you're not supposed to use a laptop on your lap)tried it on a desk and it still overheated. i decided to use a cooling mat but to no avail it was too weak and i said to hell with if i pulled an old wind dance window fan and put it under it, luckly it works...kinda the things a bit ugly lol. anyway after i "fixed" that issue i noticed that a few keys were jamming constantly, this is an engineering flaw produced by a moron, this keyboard is one of the worst ive seen, it is a raised system on standard a standard styled plastic spring with no dust guard and plenty of space for hair wires/cables/crumbs and whatever to fall into it, only way to clean it without removing the keys would be alot of canned air, when looking closer at the springs they may look standard but they are much cheaper and very fragile, they also come apart easily causing jammed keys, which if forced will break and bend the springs.... obviously not good and rather frustrating. the next issue that i still have is ive filled the hd about 180gb so far and its started to lagg horribly during load up, ive even uninstalled and prevented unnecessary programs from running on startup but its not working, im asuming the hd is going bad i have yet to finish my first year so atm im waiting for it to finally die and if it doesnt then im going to tear it apart and build a liquid cooling system for it along with get it a much more reliable hd hopefully built better than the current anyway thats my 2 cents if you still wanna buy it i don't suggest any decent quality games on it. also on another note buy a pc from someone that alows a 90day return policy not walmart....
Exciting at first, but worrying Keyboard, Touchpad, USB Port issues - Laptop returned and will look for different brands  Thousands of other reviews on this so I'll keep it brief.  Annoyances for me were -- 1) Sticking key on keyboard. Only one, but worrying how easily it can happen. 2) Keyboard layout generally awkward, esp arrow keys.  Flat keys, seemingly more-spaced-out than I'm used to. Have to watch carefully for every key press, and in subdued light very difficult to see.  I had to add a paper strip along the top to identify the special keys (speaker volume, Prt Scrn etc) more clearly. 3) Track Pad.  I should have researched Asus computers before buying - now realize this is their great Achilles Heel - very troublesome, over sensitive, have to disable all the 'multifinger swipe functions' and still the cursor can bounce around the screen. 4) 'Mouse buttons' (in touchpad) VERY 'clicky' (noisy) - gets annoying playing a game sitting next to someone (and even to myself).  They are also very spaced apart, hard to reach right-click while holding down ctrl key for example. 5) USB ports seem 'iffy' - had to jiggle my memory sticks around sometimes to get connected, (didn't have that in my Dell). 6) Win 10 is a pain in many ways. I know this isn't an Asus fault but the combination was enough for me to decide to return it within 30 days (pain-free, thanks Amazon!) and go back to my old Dell D820 with WinXP and Win7!!
Get something better  Purchased on 23 June. Broke on 17 August. Spend the little extra and save yourself the heartache.
Slow and bloated  VERY slow for a brand new computer. Tons of intrusive apps I don't need installed. Looks nice and good interface but the performance is really terrible.
Terrible touchpad  Laptop is fast however the touchpad is so terrible it's worthless as a mobile laptop. The sensitivity of the touchpad is unreliable and the buttons are unimaginable hard to press down and keep down. Great specs for the price but unworth it in the end. Keep looking unless you would never ever use the touchpad.
Way too many problems.  What a frustrating experience this has been. I received this laptop for Christmas and right out of the box was impressed by the features and look. I have never used an ASUS before and was admittedly a little skeptical, but all of the reviews seemed positive so I took the plunge. Aside from getting used to Windows 8.1, which isn't the fault of Asus, I was initially satisfied with the performance. It certainly didn't run as quickly as I expected it to (actually nowhere near my expectations), but still a major upgrade over my 6 year old HP I was previously using.  Then the problems started. After about two weeks the touch screen stopped working. I'm semi tech savvy so I poked around a bit trying to resolve the issue and trying to avoid restoring my CPU. What I ultimately realized was that the drivers had somehow disappeared completely (not even accessible from Device Manager). After not finding a solution on my own, I made a call to ASUS tech support. To their credit, the response time was quick and the representative seemed genuinely interested in resolving my issue.  Unfortunately after trying a couple minor fixes they informed me I would need to run a system restore. Well, it wasn't the end of the world since I had only had the laptop for a couple of weeks and didn't have years worth of software on it, but still annoying. The good news is that once the restore had finished the touch screen was once again working. I figured it was just a glitch and continued on enjoying my new gift.  Next, after reinstalling almost all of the software I had lost due to the system restore, my computer randomly shut down while I was in the middle of reinstalling one of the last programs. I had it unplugged for roughly 15 minutes after having it charge all morning so I knew it couldn't be that the battery was dead as I have used it unplugged for significant lengths previously... but sure enough when I plugged it back in and booted it back up the battery was showing at 0%. To make matters worse, now even though I had it plugged in to the wall the computer was giving me the notification that the battery could not be recognized. I figured that somehow I must not have had the CPU plugged in previously during the morning like I thought and that the battery was so low that it needed time to charge, thus the error. I decided to leave it plugged in for a few hours and came back expecting a nice full batter but to my surprise my battery was still showing 0% and the computer still could not recognize that it even had a battery connected. The second I unplug the machine it turns off, because it thinks there is no battery, and since the battery is internal, I cant even check to make sure the connections are secure without opening it up, which of course likely voids any warranties. I tried running another restore, and once again lost all of the programs that I had just installed for a second time, but this did not resolve the issue and it looks like I just lost everything for nothing.  So, this is where I stand now. I've had two pretty major issues in less than a month and one of which I still have no resolution for effectively making my laptop a desktop CPU which must always be plugged in to be on. I definitely am not going to take the time to reinstall every thing for a third time, and feel I will be much better off going with a brand I am more confident in.  It seems like a lot of others haven't had any major issues, so maybe I just got a lemon, but the functionality definitely doesnt match up with all of the promised features I was expecting out of this one.
not what I expected for 800.00. Charges real slow. the enter pad is real stiff  I can't get newer programs on app.  how old is this. so not pleased it supposed to have voice over and that didn't work. it took 4 hrs to try and set it up. how old is this computer? I need help.
Battery went bad just weeks after the warranty expired  Battery went bad just weeks after the warranty expired. You cannot remove the battery so you can not buy one and replace it.
I like this machine  I like this machine, but as I feared the model sent to me had 2GB or RAM, not 4GB as advertised and as the vendor assured me in advance of the order via email.  Nice little computer, compact and sturdy, but with a subpar screen.  If I had received the 4GB model I would've kept it, but since it was only 2GB I returned it, and the lackluster screen has me looking around for a possible better Chromebook alternative before I re-order this.  Still no clearcut winner there though.

PROCEED WITH CAUTION BEFORE PURCHASING  If you want a computer that breaks internally a year after purchase, go ahead and buy an ASUS laptop. The lithium battery expanded in my laptop causing the computer to split apart from the inside out, and when I sent it in because it was still under warranty they explained that because there was physical damage of the computer splitting apart it would be my responsibility to pay for repairs, if it is even repairable. ASUS what if this battery had exploded and burned down my home, what would I need to do then, would an RMA fix my home too?
Quality control issues offset by great support  I purchased my 13.3 inch MacBook Pro on January 25, 2010.  As of today the following components have failed 1) logic board (motherboard), 2) hard drive, and 3) wireless card.  Now, you may wonder why I would give the product even a two star rating.  The answer is service.  In this regard, as the owner of several Apple products (one G4 Powerbook, one MacBook, two iPodTouches with a couple of 1G & 2G iPods thrown in the mix) I think it important for prospective purchasers to understand what they are getting when they purchase an Apple product.  Stated in slightly different terms; what is it that justifies paying the Apple "premium"?  First, great design.  Second, a very gook operating system.  Third, excellent product support widely available on a walk-in basis.  (I can't imagine what it would have been like to deal with these issues via tech support in another country and a repair depot in another state.)  Notice that reliability is not on my list.  It would be nice if it were but I think the reality is that this particular notebook is neither more, nor less, reliable than the other top-tier notebook manufacturers.  Would I buy another?  Maybe.
This Notebook was supposed to have Windows 10 but it had a warning to active it.  When I went to  do that, it says that is was not installed and that I needed a product keyl.  I told the seller that and have not heard anything back.
Computer is awesome..  Computer is awesome...when it works. The computer wouldn't boot after only two months out of the box. Sent it to Dell customer support, who fixed the issue, and then sent it back to me. 2-3 weeks later I'm having the same issue again, won't boot. Now I have to call Dell customer support again and probably wait another two weeks to have the issue supposedly resolved. Probably will never purchase any Dell product ever again
didn[t work  didn[t work, had to return it, but my money was reimbursed with no problem
Was not able to upgrade and some features did not work?
Speaker System Breaks  Ive only had this laptop for a year and a half and the speaker system completely died, so I cant use it to listen to music or watch any tv or movies. While it is still functional for everything else, a laptop that doesnt play music or videos properly is pretty underwhelming.
bad buy  absolutely the worst computer i have ever purchased !!!!!!! it takes at least 5 minutes to load up when turned on,,cant stream or view any type of videos,,,besides the hard to navigate windows 8,,,,i went back to using what i thought was my crappy laptop with xp!!!
The laptop was not a working device.
Pretty useless...  Why does this computer have an HDMI output? I have no idea. Maybe if your only interest is the browse the web (and even then) this is a pretty useless computer. So, intel makes a few different types of integrated graphics (ex. intel hd 3000, intel hd 4000, etc). I own a laptop with intel HD 4000, which works very very well and can even play some decent older games (like skyrim). But, this comes with plain Intel HD (no number). I just wanted a media laptop to play movies (streaming and downloaded from amazon and such). I put this to play a 1080p and it just kept stuttering and stuttering, i looked it up and tried a few remedies such as setting the power to performance and setting graphics to max and all that, but it still stuttered. Streaming was worst. I figured anything would be able to play movies now a days, but i was very very wrong. I'm not sure what you would want this for, but i figure everybody probably wants to be able to play a movie, if that is your goal, look elsewhere, maybe if you are playing non-hd movies, but what is the fun in that?
... $2000 Paperweight  I bought this piece of junk a little over a year ago from the official website (order placed at the end of Nov. 2012), and in that past year let me recount my terrible experiences with this laptop.  Two weeks after I received the first generation Razer Blade, the hard drive came loose and I couldn't boot my computer. I didn't do anything to the laptop other than move it from my desk to my bed. Luckily, this was fixed by merely giving the bottom a good hard tap.  A week or so after that, I realized that the wireless card was faulty and would consistently drop packets. I tried this with 4-5 different routers in 3 different locations. The results were all the same. My friends, on their Lenovo/Asus/etc laptops, had no issues with the same wireless connection. This was the first time I sent my laptop back to them. It took over two weeks before they shipped it back. Luckily, I was on holiday, so this had no affects on my studies or anything.  Fast forward three months, and I get my first AC adapter failure. They sent me a replacement one after a week. That's a week in university without a laptop folks. The only access I had to the internet was my phone. Okay, I overlooked it.  Two months later, the switchblade interface stops working. I can't access synapse at all. Razer support tells me they'll get back to me and I quote, "We have forwarded the issue to our higher level technical specialist . They would be assisting you soon." They never got back to me. Whatever, I don't really need the Switchblade anyways.  November 2013. League of Legends season is ending, and I'm LITERALLY in the middle of my promo game to Platinum when all of a sudden, my laptop black screens and gets a red ring of death out of nowhere. It seems the adapter, once again, failed. This was right before my fall quarter midterms, and finals were soon to follow in two weeks time. I'm told to ship it back to them in the original boxing and whatnot, but unfortunately for me, the original packaging was back in my hometown (since I live in a different city for university). I send it back right before Thanksgiving (also right before my warranty ended). Suffice to say, I went through my midterms and finals without any access to the internet (again, save for my phone, which has pretty limited access). It was horrible. Not only was Razer Support curt and rude with their replies, they pretty much did NOTHING to help.  So I wait. And wait. Turns out, Razer sent my laptop back to my university address before I went home for Christmas break, but didn't email me that they did so, despite the fact they told me I would get updates. What kind of a company sends back a ~$2000 gaming laptop without notifying their customer that it's been shipped?!  I didn't get to my laptop until January 5th. I open it, excited that I can finally access the internet for the first time in a long while. I plug in the adapter. AND SURPRISE. THE ADAPTER ISN'T WORKING. They didn't fix anything at all. Seriously.  So I've contacted them again. And now they're sending me a new adapter. This will be my 4th adapter. I'm already expecting it to fail within a month. This is seriously frustrating and now, I don't have a warranty to fall back on either.
Overheats and Freezes, Fails and Locks up.  The title says everything.  Other reviews I have read explain my situation perfectly.  It overheats and freezes much too frequently.  I understand that an occasional lockup is to be expected, but this is ridiculous.  It happens at least once a day. The 1.4 GHz Athlon is great... when it actually runs up to speed.  I still like the AMD, but other hardware issues have plagued my Compaq. As we speak, my Compaq is in the hands of Best Buy.  Thankfully I purchased the warranty, because the power supply completely broke and needs repairs. Heed the warning and do not buy a Compaq.  Go Dell! Compaqs are cheap and unreliable.
spend more get more  Broke within 30 days
Amazing laptop, but always breaks down  Honestly, love this laptop. The keyboard is super comfortable, the touchpad is accurate, the touch screen is super effective, the overall speed and comfort is beyond satisfactory. The backlit keyboard is so cool, its a bit heavy but is a good replacement for your desktop and is simply a beauty in design. But why a two stars? Well this computer broke down three times since the second month of owning it. Dell finally fixed it well enough, but I'm always on the edge that it will break again and that I will have to keep sending it back to Dell. I'm worried it'll break again after my warranty ends and after that, it's going to be a waste. Don't buy this laptop, especially from any amazon carrier. Dell Inspiron simply isn't worthy the hassle it has given me since summer.  Maybe I got unlucky, but I would'n't risk it either. Dell is infamous for their dud products and their terrible, long customer service. They wouldn't even place the product. Sigh. 2 star for breaking product, 5 star for the laptop itself.
Dell Inspiron i7759 review  Purchased a Dell Inspiron i7559 end of Dec 2015.  I have had computer less than 5 months. Laptop was great at first.  After several months started getting blue screens frequently.  Decided to refresh Windows 10 but  first made a recovery thumb drive.  Refresh failed, another blue screen.  Tried to reinstall Win10 using recovery thumb drive, this also failed.  Called Dell support on 4/8/16, talked to them and explained what happened.  They said it was a software issue and was not covered by Dell warranty,  wanted to sell me extended  warranty for both software and hardware for little less than $300. Needless to say I'm not happy.  Also purchased Square Trade 3 year warranty when I purchased computer.  I tried filing a claim, but Square Trade rejected claim saying that computer is  still covered by Dell warranty.  What!!!  So what did I learn?  Don't buy a Dell and don't buy a Square Trade warranty.  Edit: 4/10/16 Created Windows 10 setup drive from Microsoft's web site.  "Create installation media for another PC", using "USB Flash Drive".  Dell Inspiron 7559 in question didn't respond to installation flash drive.  Tried the installation flash drive in another laptop and it loaded immediately??????
Operating system constantly crashes and developer mode limbo  I've had this chromebook for 2 months now and it has only been functional for almost one month. At first it would just give me error messages and not let me do the things I was accustomed to doing on my computer, which was annoying but I figured I just hadn't figured out how to operate it properly. Eventually it shut down and said the operating system was not accessible and I'd have to reboot my entire system for recovery. I was in the middle of a hectic week of online classes so I had no time to deal with this. Finally, I had time to download another operating system for it on my girlfriend's computer and try to reboot my chromebook. It kept telling me that I was in developer mode and it wasn't verifying the operating system, but it wouldn't tell me how to get out of developer mode. I called Samsung's help and they were NO help. I did everything they told me to do and it still doesn't work. I've "recovered" my system (and lost all my papers and personal information on the device) multiple times now and it still won't work. The location of the supposed developer mode switch has no switch, it's just a dark opening and even when shining a flashlight down it, nothing can be seen.  I've had computers since the 80's and never had one that was this shoddy. I highly recommend getting anything other than a chromebook because I can't even get the company (Samsung)<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Samsung-Series-5-550-Chromebook-Wi-Fi/dp/B007Y8DJ22/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Samsung Series 5 550 Chromebook (Wi-Fi)</a>&nbsp;to say they will take it back and replace it when I've only owned it for 2 months and it should still be under warranty.
Very Good Computer - Terrible Track Pad  While I very much like the computer, the touch pad is a deal breaker. It is so sensitive that sometimes merely passing my hand over the pad opens a window. I know it sounds impossible, but it is true. I have downloaded the most recent driver and set the sensitivity setting to the lowest values. If you are willing to rely on an external usb mouse the computer will meet your needs. It is light, attractive, great battery life, and I find the screen to be fine.  I have upgraded to Windows 8 in the hope that might mitigate the problems with the touch pad, but no luck. As I bought the Series 9 to take with me when traveling, the use of an external mouse is not an option. Therefore, 2 stars is the best I can do on balance.
Motherboard died and cost to fix to high. Only used about a year.
Low Life expectancy  Unit died after 6 months.. Sent it out for Warranty
Fantastic laptop for the price  I bought this laptop after doing a lot of research both online and in a store. I wanted a laptop that was light, had windows 8 and a touchscreen. Most of the computers that fit all of my needs were way out of my price range and when I saw this computer I was hesitant but decided to make the purchase. I have not regretted it for a minute. The computer is lightweight, the screen is vibrant and very responsive the track pad is also very responsive. I Love windows 8 and the ability to totally customize the start screen. I did learn that Google Chrome does not work if you use it to pin tiles to your start screen. You need to use internet explorer. Google Chrome can be used to browse.  If you are looking for a lightweight computer that doesn't cost an arm and a leg I highly recommend this one.  Update. My affair with this computer ended sadly. It really started to slow down and the fan really got loud after about an hour of use. I ended up returning it. :(
Lenovo's Customer Service  The Trackpad and buttons are the laptop's only real disappointment from the hardware standpoint. Clicking on the buttons frequently produces no response, and the same can be said for the touch pad. They feel cheap. The worst problem is Lenovo's customer service. I called to get an explanation on the warranty which was supposed to be 1 year, but a Lenovo email to me said that it would expire in only 6 months! Lenovo's rep asked where I had purchased it. When I said "Amazon", he said, "well that explains it!" and went on to say that it was obviously a "refurbished" unit. I responded that I had been very careful to buy a NEW one! I then asked for another explanation, and he said that he had already given me the explanation. I then asked to speak to his manager. I was placed on hold and 3 minutes later he came back and stated that a manager was "not available". I asked him to have the manager call me, and I'm still waiting!
It was great until it fell 1 foot on to the carpet and then it never worked again. We only had it a few months. :(
too slow  very slow .. takes forever to load web pages.. very disappointed
didn't work
Screen Bleeds | Super bad experience - read it why  This is the first time I wanted to buy a TOSHIBA laptop after spending time on a lot of research & reading multiple reviews.  Summary: Returned the product 4 times in a few days due to same defect. Defect: Multiple screen bleeds on the monitor/display for all the cases. Super disappointed since I lost $180 after the 4th return (more than 30 days) even after the product had a major display defect.  Why I had to return multiple times? I ordered and received the item and found that the item has bleed marks on the monitor. It looks like white/yellow/light greenish halo on the edges(every time on the edges for me) visible only on black screen(when the display is on with a black background or full screen black image). The first 2 laptops had medium 3-4 inch sized halos. Added one photo of the same - the whitish mark at the corner of the display. In actual the mark is brighter than what you see here. Similar marks were visible in multiple places of the screen. I returned both of them. (Returned the 3rd one as well which came to me as a duplicate item.)  Later I ordered the newer version i.e.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Toshiba-Satellite-S55-C5364-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Core-i7-6500U-1-TB-Hard-Drive-12-GB-RAM/dp/B015806SXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Toshiba Satellite S55-C5364 15.6-Inch Laptop (Core i7-6500U, 1 TB Hard Drive, 12 GB RAM)</a>&nbsp;which had a much bigger mark on the screen. It looked super disturbing.  Am not sure how all these happened - probably manufacturing defect or shipping problem.  Every time I complained to Amazon Customer Care, they assured me that the next one will be defect free. But it never happened.  Overall, the laptop except the display, was OK. I would have kept it if the display was OK.  Built: Doesnt feel like a very strong laptop. I wouldnt take the laptop for long trips or rough use. The edges, which touches the lap, felt uncomfortable and pokey. (as someone else mentioned it too in a review).  Trackpad/Keyboard: Loved it. I am amazed that they were able to squeeze in a Number pad without crowding the whole thing at all. Impressive design in that case.  Performance: 12 GB RAM and a good processor - but didn't find the performance to be super fast/smooth. Not sure if it is windows effect or not, but I could easily feel the lag between a click on the icon and when the application opens.  Hard disk: Archaic SATA HDD makes the start up even more slower. I think it is high time to at least include a hybrid instead.  Battery life: 4 cell battery for a laptop where people are expected to watch movies, play games, do high graphics works( e.g. photoshop/lr/aftereffects). Battery goes down super fast.  Heat/Noise: It's noisy and gets heated up quite a bit even while watching a movie(the laptop being on a flat surface with enough room to vent).  Speaker sound: Really loved it.  In the past I never faced issue with the laptop display OR may be I never looked at them so carefully.  Overall I am super disappointed since I invested so much time to plan/order/use/understand the defect/speak to customer care/return for the item and in the end I lost 180 bucks for a manufacturer defect. Totally UNACCEPTABLE. I really had higher hopes from amazon/toshiba.
Dell Support won't give refunds and their technical support is terrible Despite showing off a 4GB Graphics Card  Stopped working in under a year. Dell Support won't give refunds and their technical support is terrible  Despite showing off a 4GB Graphics Card, it is extremely low end, and the processor is only 2 cores. It says the CPU can be up to 3.1 GHz, but the fans can't cool fast enough to support higher than the default.
Very good value for the price!  I have had this laptop for two weeks now. It is very good for web browsing, watching movies, and playing games. I love the fact that I can expand the memory and storage space, more laptops need to do this!  PROS: Beautiful screen, full 1080p HD. Expandable RAM and storage, I will be adding a 1tb SSD later on. Full numpad included in the keyboard, you don't see that too often. Not too heavy for a 15" laptop.  CONS The trackpad is usable but can be inconsistent. Hopefully this will be improved with new drivers. The matte rubber coating attracts a lot of fingerprints.  Unfortunately, an issue developed where the screen would stop working after a few minutes. It would go black with a flickering strip along the top. Amazon is sending me a replacement, and I will update my review after some more time with that.  UPDATE: Unfortunately, the replacement I received would not detect any drives that I install in the extra drive bay. This one will be returned as well. I am disappointed, because when it works, this is a fantastic laptop with excellent performance and a great price.
Buyer Beware  My thinkpad came with the wrong keyboard, not the one advertised, and the corners of the keyboard were coming off.
This is a piece of crap, but I suppose you get what you pay for. I was in desperate need of a laptop after my old one would no longer turn on and bought this as a substitute. I should've waited and saved up for a better quality laptop because this one completely stopped working after a year.
Wifi Adapter Issue  Issue with the WiFi Adapter . WiFi gets disconnected after few minutes of use.
CRASHED IN EIGHT MONTHS AFTER PURCHASED!!!  Just image we bought this piece of junk hoping to get our monies worth. It worked for eight months and crashed!!! The warranty for this product was approxiamately 1 to 2 months. That says a lot about this product. Good luck to those people who bought this product and it went beyond eight months. Amazon labeled this product as new! The customer service label or sticker found below the laptop was tampered with. Nice one Amazon.
customer service is the worst  Ordered a Y550 with Win7 from Lenovo as it had good reviews, it was shipped with Vista; I returned it for re-imaging and they sent my system to someone else and sent me nothing. Now, two months later I still have nothing and all Lenovo customer service can say is "we'll call you back this week" - but they NEVER do! I'll never order anything from Lenovo again, what a total joke. With customer service like this, I know PT Barnum is alive and well... sucker!  So here I am on Amazon looking for another laptop and reading reviews to find out who really has customer service... I think I'll order my next system from Amazon, hopefully I can avoid problems like this in the future
Hopefully - the new one will serve for good: |)  SSD has unexpectedly crashed in 4 months and NO intnl warranty was provided. Hopefully - the new one will serve for good :|)
Heavy and clunky  I didn't think the cool factor would matter to me, but it does.  This may be a quality computer but it is so heavy and clunky, I don't like to use it.
It is getting very hot and the battery has been damaged less than 6 months.
Different from described  This laptop sucks, it is horrible gaming. And they only give you about 800 gb and the cpu can only run to 2.0. The battery life is very bad, it lasts about 2.5 hours instead of 8 hrs.
My first windows 8 and waiting for windows 10 so different from my favorite..XP I am using windows 7 for my business for the time being.  This is something to learn the new programs on. Having a tough screen is nice with a little machine and having is detachable is great especially for playing games while relaxing. Not sure how it would work for business computer though. Now a little over a year old and battery is no longer keeping a charge!!

Check it out closely  The disk drive didn't work so I  sent it back. If it had been all in working order then I would have given it 5 stars.  It is  really pretty in red.
$700 repair even with warranty  I just spent $700 for a repair on my Macbook Air that has a warranty.  It was only the track pad that wasn't working.  First story was that the repair was covered under my warranty.  Three days later the story was that  there was water damage and I would have to pay. Given the issues with compatibility, the premium price, and the issues with the warranty, I have to consider something else for my next computer.  Apple is good for user ease, synchronizing with other Apple devices, but it is behind the curve in technology and features and overpriced. iWorks is not as good as Word/Excel.  I have to duplicate everything that I share so that my documents and spreadsheets can be opened by my friends and colleagues. My next computer will likely not be an Apple.
Will no longer purchase from Amazon.com  I purchased this computer and was really excited to recieve it. I played with this chromebook at Best Buy and loved it, but saw an amazing deal on Amazon so I figured it would be well worth the wait. Unfortunately when I recieved the package, I found my laptop to be in horrible condition. Before I even flipped the computer open I could see obvious scratches all over the top of the computer. After further investigation, I saw oily fingerprints on the mousepad, and scratches on the screen. When I logged onto the computer, I was asked to provide a "password." If this was a so-called "new" computer, why would I be asked to provide a password? There was a user account set up, with the previous owners name and personal email clearly shown. This lax treatment of personal information is unacceptable, and the quality of the product shipped to me is embarrassing. I plan to never purchase from Amazon again, and plan on warning all friends to proceed with caution.  The only positive experience I had was with a customer relations agent named "Vijay," who proved to be understanding and quite helpful.
Ok Laptop. What can you expect for the money. Mouse pad recently broke on it. First one I ordered shipped with an already defective mouse pad. If you use an external mouse no big deal, however it is extremely disappointing that it is an issue.
watch out for Toshiba  Toshiba is known for computers that fail and the worst possible customer service. They have settled at least one class action lawsuit in the billions. We bought a Toshiba not knowing about their horrible record and it overheated. They have had it back to be serviced three times (and it was only six months old) but it still won't work. In fact when we got it back this time it won't even boot up.  Do research on the net before buying a Toshiba!
BUYER BEWARE  I can not speak to the supplier. I purchased my same make and model through Toshiba direct. What I can tell you is my product arrived with a dangerous defect. The housing itself is not ground. What this means is, when the computer is plugged into a wall, it sends an electric current through the casing where you rest your hands. My husband and I physically measured this with an ohms meter.  Customer service was awful. Hours upon hours being put on hold and transferred ended in me sending the computer back only to receive it back after 10 days with a note that said... and I quote..." All voltage and current measurements are within international specifications. No trouble found. They measured input and output, without addressing the lack of ground at all! 3 hours more, being jumped from phone number to phone number, person to person, ended in being assigned a case number to await a call back, but not before being argued with over the fact that a senior tech specialist took the measurements on the input and output and no problem was found. THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM!  2 days since my last wasted breath with this company and still no return phone call. Save your blood pressure. Pick another brand.
Why did I buy this?  Worst laptop I have ever used. I have never in my life wasted my money like this. I would have been better off flushing $300 down the toilet. The first day I got it, it was already bugging out, turning itself off/on, freezing, lagging. Buyers, BEWARE!
Won't. Hold charge till then it was find. Sent it back.
Wouldn't recommend  Seller gave decent customer service and agreed to refund when asked about it, but like the other bad reviews the product itself is terrible. Problems upon arrival were just like everyone said: battery doesn't work and is very slow.
Worked wonderfully until the power port broke away internally from the frame. And surprise, surprise, there doesn't seem to be a way to exchange it. POS. Buyer beware.
Was not brand new as advertised, received it with someone else's info and it broke in 3 months.  Was forced to ship to MFG for repair (paid by me to ship) and it broke again.
Dont buy  Not worth it ,really sluggish. Returned it right away
bad screen blinking, lenovo will not repair my laptop. i hope support see my comment and contact me. screen is bad.
great system if it worked out of the box  Got the pink system in for my wife's birthday, just in time.  Only problem is after less than an hours use the screen blanked out.  After the mandatory hour on the phone with tech support the system is considered DOA, frustration.  Amazon will replace it for me much faster than ASUS.  Cons System is unusable  Pros ASUS tech support was accessable and helpful Amazon will replace the unit and handle all shipping.
motherboard going out  Technician said the Motherboard was going out. Returned it...cost a lot in shipping for a defective machine.
A good computer for 1200 - Look somewhere else  I bought my Toshiba Satellite less than 3 months ago. The damn piece of junk already broke for the third time w/ THE SAME issue - faulty hard drive that keeps crashing. The first time I had to drive an hour and 1/2 to the CSS repair center, the tech told me it was "unusual" for a new laptop to have such a problem. The hard drive was replaced and I got the lap top back in a week or so.  August 19, 2008 - the Laptop is received from repair and powered on. August 23, 2008 - the Laptop breakes..AGAIN.  When I dish out a nice lump of money for a product, I expect it to last me LONGER than a month...anyone else?  I call the Toshiba support, they tell me to ship it to them, claiming their techs have better equipment and training and will fix the issue, no prob. I send the thing and get it back in about a week or two. Finally, I power it on (this past Monday) and in a few days(on wed.)GUESS WHAT??! SAME PROBLEM!! They didn't fix SQUAT! The hard drive croaked again!! The system.dll is yet again "missing or corrupt", windows won't start, and the computer boots straight into a blank, black screen.  Called them, told them how it was, didn't hold any temper back, and got transferred to the Customer Relations Center where I spoke to Jose, the *&#()hole (pardon me). I asked Jose if I could be transferred to a supervisor, not to be a pain, I just wanted to speak to someone who would be the last option and get straight to the point. This piece of ^#*@ tells me (and I quote): "I won't let the issue escalate beyond me. So you will have to speak to me"...  Huh? But I don't want to speak to YOU...I want to speak to a supervisor. I want to explain this problem to someone who CAN do something about it. But Jose wouldn't have it. When confronted with my assumption that it pretty improbable for a hard drive to be faulty, with dead spots THREE times in a row, Jose snobbishly stated: "We don't expect our customers to know anything about proper functioning of hardware. Only our techs would know that." aka. your too stupid to know anything about that . When it came down to my options I got the good, 'ol run-around: "Mam', you have two options. You can either take your laptop to a repair center. Or you can send it in to our repair depot." Hmmm..sounds familiar. OH WAIT! Because I already did that! And the problem was still not resolved!!!  Given the fact that this "customer relations manager" failed to assist, and plainly just told me to f -off, I decided to call back. The results? The customer support rep(which, despite the same bullcrap, was a bit more properly mannered) promised that everything will be taken care of...  ..once I send the laptop in for repair.. ...again...  Stating that he will write up a "full repot" on this case and make sure that the techs run all the proper test, Eric assured me that they will do everything in their power so that I "will never experience the same problem again". Ok Eric. I got your word for it...and your employee ID. So you better be right. The laptop will ship out tomorrow and should be back for my evaluation in a week or so.  Before you buy this junk I highly recommend reading customer review and complaints posted all over internet. Good luck.
Advertised as supporting Intel WiDi but it does not,  Spent a few hours trying to configure WiDi...all dead ends, Contacted Samsung: "Smith:  I see that the laptop model number NP350E7C-A01US you have provided does not have WiDi feature."  WiDi support is all over Amazon's product description.  After waiting for the product and wasting time, now I have to wait 48 hours for the seller to "consider" my return request.  Ok, I did make some progress with learning Windows 8. Not a COMPLETE waste of time.
We bought this laptop and it didn't power on. We called customer service and they offered to send us a new hard drive and walk us through installation. Ummm, no, not on the first day. Really disappointing.
Disappointed  Disappointed with this product! Laptop worked for a few weeks then there was a green tint on the screen. Im in the process of getting a refund!
its too small, less then the size of a laptap.its images are awful
since i never got this item i do not know what expertations i can have.  i never got this item. I do not know how to rate this product. I am sorry, i hope to have more luck next time and give you a good rating.
It works  It's cheap. Since this is mac it works. In my case Refurbished was meaning - not the best battery which is sending million errors into systen logs and not the best HDD with problems, but anyway - hdd problems not a big deal, lion will not be updated on this mac, almost, it  works. Battery allows work about 1 hour - not bad for absulutely noname battery. Power supply - the same like battery I even do not know who manufactured it - definetely not Apple or some known Apple replacement, just works. How long time it will work - i do not know, basically power supply is not very hi tech staff so hope it will work. Yes, i've ovepayed a little bit, but i wanted black color so.... It's not bad, it works, it's unix, less expensive than new, doing work what suppose to be done. But if you have a lilltle bit more money, but newer mac without issues I have now.
Not happy  Got this for my 11 year old for Christmas.  Have had all sorts of strange problems with it...it makes a high pitched whirring sound randomly and very often.  Also it totally froze up where we had to completely reset it and lost different files that we had.  All this in under two months time...bummer.  Originally I was told that ASUS is a great company, but this has been much less than impressive for us.
yuck  Working on google chrome exclusively became a real pain and made it extremely limited in scope.  I wish they made something in this size with Windows 8
Video: Put in headphones as the sound is pretty low [...]  The laptop in itself is pretty good. My problem comes in when I have a game (league of legends mostly) open and try to do anything else on the computer such as open the internet. Any sound playing gets slow and very distorted and electronic/static sounding and everything lags for about 5-10 seconds. It is difficult to explain I'll admit. This has also happened a few times mid-game and is very frustrating. I do not know if this is a driver issue or hardware. Things I have done in an attempt to fix this include: -Disabling the additional sound drivers -Updating all drivers (NVidia, sound, etc) -reinstalling sound drivers (although that still would explain the lag that comes along with the sound becoming distorted) -Closing any unneeded background programs (not much considering it's brand new) -Uninstalling the antivirus I put on there (someone online said it may work. it didn't)  I am currently unaware of how to fix this issue. If anyone has any knowledge of how to fix this it would be much appreciated. If not, unfortunately I will have to return this laptop as this is unacceptable. If the issue gets resolved I will re-rate but as of now 2 stars is where it stands.  I will record the issue after work and attach a video
This computer was a piece of crap.  It started shutting off and turning  back on by itself practically from day one.  Now the sound doesn't work.
better luck next time.  I had problems out of the box and returned the item.
Fails at basic functions  I bought this as a gift for my husband, who wanted a basic small laptop purely for writing purposes. It sounded ideal. First of all the software is poorly thought out. It is hardly intuitive. To simply type out a document you have to be connected to wi-fi, there isn't any option to do it off line that we could find. Also coupled with a backspace key that sticks FREQUENTLY, the instant save feature in google docs makes writing infuriating. Any progress my husband made was randomly deleted and then instantly saved in its deleted state! We have had it for a week and now are going to return it. Amazon wants us to delete all personal information; how do you delete all personal information when it is intrinsic to the chromebook functionality? We are simply going to log off everything, (a new email account, wi-fi and pandora is all we have used)and hope that we don't run into any problems with Amazon. Stay away from all Chromebooks, don't let the cheap price lure you in.
Pure Crap!  This computer is horrible, It's slow and I cant even enjoy facebook on it. I sent it in and paid $15 to ship it and wasted my money to send it because it came back to me with the same issues! Then customer support calls back asking how is everything going I tell them that it still has the same issues and they tell me to sit closer to me router! ha! they are hilarious! I have two dell laptops both by the way are 5 plus years old and work perfectly fine away from the router on wifi. The xbox works fine on the wifi and all of the cell phones that come in my home! But this hp laptop is the only thing that has a problem. Please save your money and do not buy this laptop get a Dell or Toshiba! Do not buy an HP laptop! you may get a good one you may not...... I wish I could get my money back!
Horrible Laptop, Will never buy one of these again!  I hate this laptop!! Have had it only 2 years and it never seems to work right. First year I had to replace the hard rive, and second year the fan went out. I am a college student I need a reliable laptop and this isn't the one for someone who is in college!!
kept freezing up it was refurbished though
Not our luck(?)  I had purchased many laptops through out the years, including Dell, HP, Toshiba and Acer laptops, for small office use. This HP notebook was recommended to us based on its decent spec and attractive pricing. The first unit received made loud noises when the hard drive was running. We decided to get a replacement through Amazon just in case. Amazon shipped out a brand new replacement unit first while allowing us to return the defected unit (great service, Amazon!). The second unit received worked well for about 45 days only! We started to receive battery low warnings when the laptop is being plugged with power adapter. 2 days after the battery low warning, the laptop simply cannot be powered up. Since we have the same kind of HP power adapter in office (reminder, this is not the kind of self-troubleshoot process a home/personal user may get to do), we gave it a try and the machine can boot up. Perhaps it's just our bad luck, I had never have a laptop giving us so much headache within such s short period of time. If we were still within the allowed return period, I would not hesitate to return the order and look for another model.
Really a poor laptop even for this price  Really a poor laptop even for this price. Bad experience. Extramly slow!!!!!!! Don't know what to do with it. Really regret for buying this garbage.
Flimsy hinges, flimsier returns policy!  I bought one of these Aug 1, 2014 and the right hinge broke after only 17 days! I sent it in for repair through the merchant that I bought it from, hoping Lenovo fixes it without charging me! Buyer be ware!  Sept 5th, update. My retailer sent this to Lenovo, they repaired it in less than a week. Got to give the devil his due so it's only fair to report that the repair was expedited and free of charge. It is worrisome that another reviewer indicates same hinge issue after 3 more months and he got the door (with good hinges) closed in his face by Lenovo.
cheap build  No CD/DVD. Not that cheap after all. very cheap build. the keyboard feels like it is going to come apart.
If you're looking to use the 10-key, don't buy this laptop  If you're looking for an inexpensive laptop that has a 10-key, this might be it, but if you plan on using the 10-key, I don't recommend this laptop.  The keyboard layout has four additional buttons at the top right, which are a "calc" button, rewind, play/pause, and fast-forward.  Because these keys are there, the Home, PgUp, End, and PgDn buttons are on the 10-key pad.  To use them, you have to turn off NumLock, which makes the keyboard really ineffective.  I don't know who designed this keyboard or how they could have thought this was a good idea, but this makes the 10-key completely worthless to me.
Blank screen with purple lines  After 6 months of use- screen started to flicker. Now is completely black with purple lines.
DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP.  I've had this laptop for a year and a half now. Let me tell you. It works great for a year. After that, it becomes a complete garbage. I've had cheaper laptops and caused less troubles over the years. It broke 2 times for me. 1st time was when this laptop wasn't even 1 year old. I had the warranty so I had it covered. Problem was simple. Computer just blacked out on me and never turned back on again. I had to call them, but it took them more than a month to fix my laptop. I needed my laptop asap and try to fasten the process for my business, but they never let me. I asked what the problem was on my laptop, and they say it was the power line inside of the laptop got messed up. I am VERY certain that I used this laptop as careful as possible in all circumstances. There was NO WAY I could have messed up the power like that. I know enough about laptops that I wouldn't do such thing to my laptop that is brand new. 2nd time is right now. The warranty got ended and I have to bear with the problem at the moment. The problem is, it keeps getting shut off for no FXXXing Reason. I tried to find the reason why, but it just turns off on me every now and then whenever it's in use. I tried formatting it, cleaning the laptop, and it doesnt seem to fix the problem. I'd like to send it to get it fixed again, but its gonna take another 2 months to fix it, so I'm just bearing with this problem.  As a whole, don't buy this laptop or brand. I gave this brand a chance, but it does me no good, so I'm NEVER buying a product from this company EVER again. Just try other brand or laptop. this laptop is not worth the price and time that you have to pay.
never again  Maybe it is the combination of windows 8 and Sony.  This is the worst laptop I've ever owned.  Very frustrating operating system. Have an HP with win 7 and it works flawless.  This does not has sound through the HDMI connection.  The help page says it is the TV.  My hp with win 7 plays to the TV no problem.  The help... what help read the files.  If I could return it I would.....  Most of the fustration is with Windows 8.  Without the mouse is is diffucult to select multpule files, drag and drop into other files.  Using the screen, the touch pad to right click and a keyboard is ackward.  Also short of miss the ablity to window view applications to copy and paste between.  Update 10-21-2013 after searching on the web discovered a solution to the sound problem consisting of reinstalling a intel sound driver.  It worked!! Thinking of the many hours of trouble shooting to resolve, still a fustrating experiance overall.
After first update to Windows 10 there is no storage left  I got the product enrolled. Set up my account, loaded the HP printer and then tried to load MCAfee but it wouldn't work. I tried to see what the problem was but wasn't able to solve quickly. Since I wasn't comfortable that it was adequately secured I didn't allow the family to use it and set it aside. When I logged back in later I found that HP was recommending an update to Windows 10. I tried to load it but is said my drive was full. I looked and Windows says the drive is 28GB and that 20GB are already full. I tried to clean the "Bloatware" but was only able to clean out a few temp files. I still needed 7.8 GB and had just less than that. I therefore haven't stored any of my own files, can't take the first update to Windows 10 or load McAfee because the entire "32 GB" is completely used up. This was supposed to be for web browsing and for kid to access their homework on the web. I also don't have the space to load MS Office for students. However, I can't even keep my computer up to date or load McAffee. I do not recommend this product at all and would give zero stars if this website allowed it.
2011 macbook pros are know to have gpu problems. As I'm sure the seller is aware. Only a matter of time. Avoid 2011 models.
If I could give negative stars I would.  This computer broke within a week and asus customer service was garbage.  Gave me the run around and now I am out of a laptop.  Save your money and buy anything but an ASUS cause their customer service in a joke.
Do not buy an ASUS laptop  The hinge mechanism is faulty workmanship. I bought the laptop in August 2013. The hinge broke and because it is molded to the LCD, ASUS is expecting me to pay $165 as well as shipping ($30.00) for the repair. ASUS will not stand by its warranty even though the hinge initially broke after my owning it only 2 weeks. I have never written a negative review before. However, my frustration with ASUS is extremely high. Repeated emails from a local computer repair man, who is officially sanctioned by ASUS for repairs, have not resulted in anything. He, also, has decided to break all ties with ASUS after this incident.
I don't recommend buying it for school work  Too slow, I don't recommend buying it for school work
Tempted to Return it  I got this computer as a solution to not wanting a large lap top any more but also wanting a tablet.  I am not a fan of the new windows home screen, but was able to work off the desktop just fine.  The computer does too many updates and randomly kicks you out of what you are doing, to run and update and restart (sometimes freezing in the process).  This is a brand new computer and should not have so many bugs and glitches.  I honestly only use it to house my photos and music, otherwise this would drive me crazy if I had to use it for school or work!
Horrible
with terrible sensitivity and feels like a brick  Absolute poop. ASUS does not deliver as the performance is miraculously slow. Thanks to asus for overloading its laptop with spam and unneeded programs.  In addition, ASUS has still not fixed its celebrated keypad. it still functions poorly, with terrible sensitivity and feels like a brick.  The battery is atrocious, cannot survive more than 2 hours after charge. Yes ASUS it will last longer if I do absolutely nothing on the laptop, but if you decided to run even one or two programs, and god forbid surf the web, the battery flops faster than an Adam Sandler movie.  I have loads of complaints, but not enough steam to continue. I will NEVER purchase another ASUS laptop again. period.
I would give it zero stars if that were an option. This laptop has been in my closet since the time of purchase because WiFi won't connect. "Google" the product name and model number and "WiFi" problems to see for yourself. I have contacted Samsung several times but they only offer repair if I send it back to them, wait for repair, etc. Should be eligible for a refund... More worthless than a piece of cardboard... Do not purchase this unless you enjoy sitting in front of your laptop and continually restarting in a failed attempt to connect to a WiFi signal.
Do yourself a favor and find a different Chromebook  We bought this for our daughter as required for high school.  It had great reviews and had a good price.  She has used this for less than 2 months, and it is kept in a neoprene pouch between classes and when not in use.  Last week, a defect started to appear on the upper left portion of the screen, that has now progressed to a third of the screen blocked out and unusable.  There was not an impact or damage to cause this.  It is essentially non-working at this point.  I called ASUS to check about the warranty.  I was told that I had to pay the shipping to send it back, it would be gone at least 7-10 business days, and the manufacturer would deem if it was "manufacturer defect or user damage."  If it was deemed damaged, we would be responsible for all repairs. After the phone conversation, I have no confidence that this company would take responsibility for it's defective product. I will not pay the money for shipping just for them then say it was damaged, when in fact it wasn't.  Please, save yourself $200 and buy another product by another manufacturer.  You might be lucky and get one that works, but then again, you may not and you will just be out $200 like we are.
Another steaming heap by Dell...  I bought this to treat myself to something nice about 3 years ago. I have a business grade Dell as well which works nicely, but I would advise all to stay far, FAR away from consumer level dell products - whether low or high end. They just don't work, period.  It takes about 3 minutes to boot in Windows 7 professional, even after clean install. Then it takes another 5 minutes for all the programs to get fully loaded up; very laggy during this time. It's like an arthritic grandpa trying to get out of bed. Sometimes I just have to restart the whole thing b/c it starts lagging so heavily I can't do crap without the stupid clock icon coming and spinning or programs timing out.  I've 16 gb ram BTW, so I don't know what the heck is wrong with Dell's MOBO/CPU architecture that causes all these issues.  Battery, like someone else said, runs down in less than a year. It's also poorly seated, so anytime you jiggle the laptop a little bit wrong, the whole thing just turns off.  Congrats dell, you've succeeded in introducing another steaming heap to the market.
Turned me off of Toshiba and only got worse  I had the computer for one month and the screen malfunctioned.  I sent it to Toshiba for them to repair it under warranty. Then about two to three weeks later I receive it back, with a copy of the warranty and a note saying the repairs are not covered but without stating the reason.  What they did with it for three weeks is anyone's guess as I heard nothing from the company. After more hours on the phone with the company, it appears that any issues with the screen are assumed to be the customer's fault and Toshiba calls you a liar if you try to convince them otherwise.  For comparison, I had an Asus whose screen malfunctioned after 11 months and they replaced it no questions asked.  The computer itself is a fine machine but if you happen to get a lemon, you will get no love from Toshiba.  So thanks to their policies, I will not look to purchase any Toshiba products in the future.  Update: After receiving it back from their repair facility, the computer would not charge or turn on when plugged in.  Weeks more with the Toshiba repair facility await. What a horrible product
Not sure what I got.  I ordered Dec 18th for classes that were to begin in Jan.  It was sold as a new product so I expected everything to be working and included. I just opened it yesterday. There was a upc sticker covering the original box upc. Also lots of permanant markings crossing out numbers printed on the box. Not sure if this is important. Seems odd for something major like an electronic device. After starting it I got a blank blue screen and could not do anything. I checked the return policy. I realized I had bought from a third party. No return policy is listed for Pepe Electronics. No way to email Pepe Electronics. I left it charging over night. The next morning I took the laptop to be diagnosed and when the tech turned the computer on it was working. So, maybe it just needed the programs updated. I'm leary just because there was no warning that it might happen and I did not have any security for my purchase if something was wrong. A Return policy should be clearly posted. Is Pepe Electronics is reputable or not?  I will post updates. I may change my star rating after using it and finding it to work up to expectations.
Please do not buy this laptop  I have had this laptop for less than 1 year now. It had problems the day I brought it home from Fry's Electronics. I used it for 1 month and the past 10 months I have been speaking with customer service and tech support. I have sent my laptop in to the Sony servicing center countless times and they still have not fixed the problems. Each time I get my laptop back, it still has the issues it had when I sent it in. Please do not buy this laptop. Sony customer service and tech support is the worst support that I have ever received with an electronics company. I thought Sony was superior to other laptop brands, but even Dell was better than this. The only problem I had with my dell laptop was a factory recall, which they fixed immediately. Please do not waste your money on this laptop. Beautiful finish and great specs, but it quality does not match its appearance.
trash  This laptop computer stopped working about a month after I bought it. I will never buy apple products again. I don't know if it was just the one that I got but I am quite disapointed.
Waste of money, disappointing and frustrating  You get what you pay for, especially in a computer. I have driver updating software, and every single driver in this computer was deemed "very old" by this software...out of the box!  Computer has to be plugged in all the time, battery only lasts about 15 minutes on its own. Put in max amount of memory, and still extremely slow internet. I suspect "very old" outdated components were used for this machine. Might be okay for a first computer for a 10 year old, or a first computer for a 70 year old. Everyone else, step up and buy a better machine
Not so Ruggedized!!!  My 14 year old son received this as a gift from his grandmother a little over a month ago for him to start high school. He dropped it on our wood floors (normal drop) and now the screen is cracked!!! So much for the rubber edges to protect it from "normal" drops. Of course the warranty doesn't cover it. (Big supersize...NOT ) They want to charge me $60 for diagnostic (don't need that. The screen is CRACKED) and then another $119.99 (estimate cost) to fix it. REALLY!!! DON'T ADVERTISE with a Video and written THAT THIS CHROME BOOK IS RUGGEDIZED AND CAN WITH STAND NORMAL DROPS!!!!
Computer refuses to perform updates. Currently spending more for repair than I paid for netbook.
Was great for a fw months then blew the fan  Was great for a fw months then blew the fan. If you get this definitely get an extended warranty. Personally I won't ever buy HP again. I know I`m crazy but I think a laptop should last longer than 8 months.
Laptop is a dud!  Charger won't charge past 50% and screen randomly turns off  As the title says this HP product is another one that I have tried and tried again to work with. This HP laptop overheats way too much for its size and can cause severe burn on a child's face/hands. HP's products are not only defective but they are quite dangerous. As I said the laptop can only hold a charge for about 1 hour before needing to get plugged back in. Now I bought a laptop so I won't be tied down by cords and strings. This HP is worse than my desktop in that regard.  Also even if you leave the laptop plugged in all night it never goes back 50%.  When I called HP support the tech guy said I must have not drained the battery when I got the laptop.  I JUST GOT THE FRICKEN LAPTOP 2 weeks ago!! Also when I asked them about the screen they said that they were having quite a few people complain about that and it must have been that during shipping the laptop got bounced around so much the wires were all basically twisted and tangled and that they couldn't do anything about it.  HP makes duds as you can tell and this laptop is one of them.  Buy it and feel free to waste your own money.  ID
Lead chinaee  Smell like lead I thur it away it was the worst laptop I have every gotten. Get an apple laptop
not the greatest. crashes frequently  not the greatest. crashes frequently. glitches and messes with the wifi in the whole house. screen is too small. doesn't stream well, not even netflix. i feel like crying every time they tell me that i can't return it. what a waste of 200$
WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER  WINDOWS 10 KILLED MY MACHINE.  It started with not being able to connect to the internet. Four hours of Dell Tech support remoting in  and IT'S DEAD.  They sent a replacement that was DOA out of the box. I've spent at least 10 hours with customer service and have had no computer at home for 2 weeks. Customer service is a nightmare. Everyone transfers you to someone else and no one fixes the problem. I have currently filed a BBB complaint because I am left with 2 coasters that used to be laptops.  Buy a MAC ! It's worth the extra money.  I'm shocked this is still available on Amazon. Dell never di fix my machine and sent me a nasty little note saying they would no longer honor any warranty.  NEVER BUY DELL.
Asus does not support its products or customers  I used to buy Asus productsd all the time. I recently bought a Zenbook. Great computer, until the power socket went bad. It took two weeks for them to get back to me with an RMA number. Had to pay for shipping, then the service center sent me an email saying they wanted me to pay for shipping back. Got it back, but had other problems.  6 weeks later, I have been able to use it for less than two of them. Their only answer is "Call and get an RMA and send it back for repair. They won't refund or replace it or send me a temporary to use. I will never buy Asus again.
USB drives never worked since the mother board was damaged.  I didn't fire it up in time for the warranty to lapse.  Total scam.
Good when it Performs well, which is RARE  The MacBook Pro performs well when it's actually working, however their are countless small issues with the laptop. Here are just a few of the issues I've had (that could not be solved after 10+ phone calls to Apple, and 3 genius bar appointments):  1) Connection Timeout - when multiple people are connected to Wi-Fi my MacBook was unable to connect at all. My brothers Samsung laptop had no issues connecting which leads me to believe his CHEAPER Samsung has a better Wi-Fi receptor. 2) I lost a ton of my files at one point. Luckily all of my important business information was backed-up multiple places, but I lost about 10 pages of an extremely important project the day before it was due. As you can assume, I wasn't too happy about having to rewrite all of that since it was backed-up at the time. 3) Goes to sleep automatically. I need to talk on the phone for business calls and use my MacBook simultaneously and whenever my phone was connected to a call within 3-5 feet of my Mac it would go to sleep automatically.  The list could go on and on and on and on! It's really a pretty powerful computer when its working properly, but enjoy those rare times that it is! I understand no laptop is perfect and they all have flaws, so I'll list a few things this computer does better than most competition: 1) Great battery life. Not much to say here other than the battery life is awesome, and seems to be at least 30% better than most others. 2) Quick processor. I purchased the performance upgrade (faster ghz processor, more RAM, memory, etc) and I must say the performance is impressive for a Dual Core. It seems to keep up with your average Quad Core processor, however a high-quality Quad Core will make this MacBook look foolish (and you can get extremely high-quality Quad Cores MUCH cheaper than a $1500 MacBook).  I think everyone should decide for themselves, but - in my opinion - the cons of this computer greatly outweigh the pros. Save the money and buy a cheaper laptop that will perform just as well and hopefully come without the many flaws of the MacBook. I paid $1500 for the upgraded 13" MacBook Pro, and my brother paid $1200 for his Samsung which is much more impressive than my MacBook. Although the battery life on the MacBook is flawless, I (like many others) have constant access to chargers and outlets so the battery life really isn't necessary.  BOTTOM LINE: This computer IS NOT worth the money. You are paying a massive premium for the brand name and the quality simply DOES NOT represent the price tag. I've been extremely impressed with what Samsung offers for the money; other than battery life an equally prices Samsung will do everything better than this Mac.
Laptop did not work well, Keyboard and Backlight a real pain.  I'm really disappointed & upset with the product and the seller, i bought it in USA and sent it to my fam house, then i moved it to my country, Guatemala, unfortunately, the computer was not working well, the keyboard & the backlight did not work, I tried several ways and nothing, finally i had to pay an expert to fix the problem, he installed several patches/tools, that's not fair,  I paid $150!
Don't Buy Unless You will never need support  For the first few months, I loved it.  Exactly what I needed.  I planned to take it on a trip overseas. Everything worked fine until this morning.  I turned it on, could hear the disks running, but no screen display. Black.  Took almost an hour to find the correct page on the support site.  It gave only lame, worthless suggestions.  When they didn't help, I was instructed to contact a local support service provider.  There are none in California.  There are four or five in the US but only on the East Coast and all of them only accept "walk in" customers.  I leave on my trip in 30 days.  Bottom line, I am out of luck.  Unless you are a professional who can deal with these kinds of problems on your own, I suggest you stay away from ASUS products all together.  I hate to bad mouth a manufacturer like this and, if by some miracle I am able to resolve this problem, I will edit this review. Until or unless that happens I will count ASUS as one of the criminally irresponsible and exploitive companies bloating the world economy.
Constantly goes into "not responding mode" I have very good WiFi, Look for something else with better reviews
Do not purchase this laptop, it is circa early 2000's and far too expensive (even for new laptops)  This is far too expensive for any laptop, even brand new and this laptop is circa early 2000's.  Please do not purchase this
MacBook Horrible Conditon - BUYER BEWARE!!  The screen had dead pixels, also had large scratches on the screen as well. The MacBook body was coming apart, bent around the edges, scratches all over. Multiple ports did not work as well. The computer is basically not usable, I feel sorry for whoever else buys this laptop. I immediately returned it upon opening it.
Hard Driive Problems  Not a good laptop, ASUS gives too many problems. The operating system stopped working because of the hard drive. The hard drive ended up not working after 5 months of use and I needed to send  it in to get the part replaced.
There were issues with screen flicker when I received the laptop. I had to first download and install the latest driver software to fix this before I could actually use the laptop.
Not a fan  I bought this to travel with, because I didn't want to take my macbook too far away from home. This laptop looks cheap, is way to small, too slow and difficult to use.
It worthes $100  I knew the company made too much profit one it, but still could not help buy got one at $390 at this beginning of the year after reading all the positive reviews. 1. Bad technical support. Emailed two questions, no answer. 2. Card reader constantly has error when it is hot in summer. 3. Less powerful cpu (actual speed 600MHz). I added 2G memory. They are useless with such cpu. Cannot properly play the popular MKV format movie. 4. It is small, but it does not fit my pocket. I don't see much difference with a normal laptop when carrying it for travel. 5. The key board is too small. Those who has a PDA with mini key board knows it. 6. I am wondering whether all those positive reviews are from the true users.  Wish I had bought a much powerful laptop at the same price I paid for this one.
Computer comes with No hard drive, no power source.
I knew this would be an older computer, but thought it was refurbished enough to keep up with my kids.  Not so much.  It's physically heavy & they can't do their homework.
M17x R4 ultimately exchanged for different model  updated 12 Jan 2014  Great for gaming!  Use it for world of tanks, Arma II, Arma III.  On the high end graphics games, you'll hear the graphics card fan kick in, but not 'that' loud.  However, my experience wasn't that great as far as the hardware.  Could just be a coincidence and I'm one out of a hundred.  My first m17 was dead on arrival.  2nd laptop lasted 9 months.  I have gone through two on site tech visits and one depot repair with the second m17 and no luck getting it repaired  Dell has since exchanged the M17x R4 with an Alienware 18 (so far so good!).  You must take care of your warranty!!!!
NOT A Good deal for the money.  Received this for Christmas, so far so good. Changed mouse speed to my satisfaction and all seems well. Not a high end unit by no means but gets the job done.   Up date, Very troublesome thing. Only turns on once in a while even with full charge. Some times it can be days! Drains the battery when fully shut down. Have tried many different options in battery settings, tryied different ways of shutting it down, on and on and on!  Stay away from this prouduct as now I'm out $200.00 and all I have is a portable surface to write notes on!!!!
This computer is the biggest piece of garbage I have stumbled upon  If I could give this zero stars I would. This computer is the biggest piece of garbage I have stumbled upon. I knew that with it being so cheap, it wasn't going to be a long lasting computer, but I bought it for my 7 year old with hopes he could use it for simple websites, like nick jr. or youtube. Nope. This thing didn't even last a full two weeks before it started crashing. It won't even turn on at this point. DON'T waste your money.
Poor internet capability  Slow startup and poor internet capability. Fell apart as soon as the warrants expired.
A barely usable desktop replacement  I received this machine for review purposes - I would not have purchased it with my own money, having previously had a poor experience with a Toshiba Portege R500 about 10 years ago.  That having been said, this machine is a reasonable desktop replacement with a large hard drive, relatively fast processor, and a dedicated video  card.  It also has good speakers, a DVD drive, an SD slot, and some USB 3 ports.  The 15.6 inch screen has a relatively small half-inch bezel, a reasonable chiclet-style keyboard, and a nice big trackpad.  However, it has many issues: 1, Build quality is pretty bad - Plasticky, sharp edges, and a trackpad that feels like I'm about to press through it 2, Weight is significant - It's a 5 pound brick and really only good as a desktop replacement 3, Keyboard is only OK - The layout is OK but the keyboard is not backlit and the spacebar is a bit small.  The trackpad is too easy to swipe, moving the cursor to a completely different part of the screen, which gets really annoying when typing. 4, Hard drive is huge but slow - This machine has a slow-spinning 1 TB hard drive; it does not have the more desirable solid-state drive. 5, Included DVD drive is a waste of space 99.9% of the time - None of my other machines have an optical drive and I've never missed it. 6, Screen is old technology - The resolution is low (1366 x 768 isn't even 1080, let alone "4k") and is not touch sensitive.  The compromises aren't awful, but they do raise the question of who would want to buy this machine.  The high-end core i7 processor, dedicated graphics card, optical drive, and big hard drive might make this machine great for students who download movies and play a few games.  However, the resolution of the screen is not that great and it weighs too much to carry around.  In addition, the battery life is pretty lousy compared to the HP Elitebook that I use at work.  It's probably intended as a desktop-replacement, to be hooked up to a decent monitor and keyboard.  If that's what you're looking for, this may be a reasonable machine for your purposes.
Windows 10 is terrible  Cheap product. Windows 10 is terrible
Don't know if chrome book worked well since it arrived damaged!  I was so excited to get this computer. I know it's risky buying refurbished but I've usually had good luck, especially from amazon. But this had a bent case and two USB ports did not work. What a shame.
Horrible  Can't connect to the internet. Came with broken network adapter
I was so disappointed that this happened in the first place  Received this brand new computer in August 2016. By November 1st 2016 it stopped working. Power cord & battery would not work. Mailed it to sony, they had to fix FOUR defective things. Replacing parts, etc...I was so disappointed that this happened in the first place. This is the first time I've bought a sony laptop. The only good thing I can say is Sony did take care of the problems under warranty. My computer was gone for about 2 weeks during repair. We'll see how long it works well now since I've gotten it back home.
WORST LAPTOP, WORST EXPERIENCE. EVER.  Oh my God! I've had this computer two weeks and on half a dozen different occasions the screen would just go black. Sometimes the computer would just shut off and then I would have to turn it on again, after losing all of my work. Today... It simply would not turn on at all. No screen. No lights. Dead. Customer Support? Non existent. No live person on the phone. Just instructions to go online and deal with that yourself. A tremendous amount of work is lost forever. Thanks HP.
I'm disappointed that it hasn't held up  It's 2017 and after only 4 years of relatively light and stationary use, this computer has failed me. It's dust magnet, the keys stick, and the biggest issue is that the audio jack has stopped working for no reason. I want to reiterate that i used this lightly - no moving, banging, and only used indoors. I'm disappointed that it hasn't held up. The ram also wasn't enough - when all i did was have itunes and a browser open, it would freeze. Next time I'll go more powerful.
Constantly has dumb updates  Having a hard time liking this laptop...or mainly the software. I've had it for four months now. It constantly updates, which takes forever. Then when you have to restart it after the updates it takes forever. It once updated right in the middle of a movie I was watching and wouldn't let me adjust the time for the update or delay it. Don't get me wrong, "thanks" for staying up to date but come on. Also, about a month into having this laptop, it already froze on me. And I was only browsing the internet with like two tabs open. Then, when I restarted after it froze, it took forever to reboot. Just frustrating.
Not worth the headache!  I purchased 2 of the 11 inch screens. My Acer messed up 2 days after the Amazon warranty had expired. It tells you that they give enough data for updates for Windows 10 but that's a lie. I had nothing downloaded on my husband's or mine. I also had a 32 gb card for mine just in case I wanted to download Audible and Amazon.  Acer did not allow enough storage on these. If it doesn't have enough storage for updates it won't play. My laptop kept turning off and on. It couldn't update anymore because it had no room left. I went thru it to check to see what was downloaded so it could be uninstalled. I would not recommend this laptop unless Acer puts enough storage space for downloads. This is 2 laptops that were purchased in October 2015 that did the exact same thing.
Factory Default!  there was a review that the dell xps had some factory defaults, I didn't take it into consideration but it turnout I received mine with one too!! see the photo attached!!! The customer service was not helpful with this issue either!!! I don't what happen with Dell quality!!!
So disappointed !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  For people who trying to read this or buy this PC beawre- cuz my 3 three years old PC faster than this with all the new CPU i7  but its nothing plus the graphic its really bad when you trying to connect it on the HDMI or anything imagine the picture with Netflix its really bad - this PC for doing some office job like only checking your email- facebook-....ets nothing else  The screen moter its really bad qulity like so loose can't stand 90 degrees,  Its bad qulity PC and I'm return it .
Not what I expected!!!
I like Acer products  I like Acer products, they are reliable and inexpensive. Most of them have worked well for me. This laptop had a small defect: one of the USB ports didn't work right. I spent hours trying to transfer my data from my old computer to this one and failed each time. Then I tried to transfer one image from my old to the new computer using a trusted old flash drive and a brand new one. In each case the image broke up. I am assuming that the USB port is to blame but honestly, it could be a number of different causes to blame. I am returning this computer and getting a new one, probably an Acer. So, this is an unusual case in my experience.
Seems cheap  I've only used it once and I already hate it.  The keyboard keeps typing random 8s so I have to keep back spacing.  It's brand new and it seems like a cheap piece of junk.  I think it's going back unless I can get a solution to this problem.  I do a lot of typing so constantly having to delete the 8s is getting on my nerves.  I had to delete 8s five times while typing this review.  Don't waste your money
Very flimsy  I wish I could give this zero stars. I have had so many random problems with the operating system and after owning for 2 years the hinges have both snapped. Do NOT waste your money here.
Didn't last very long  I got this for my daughter primarily because of the pink color which was somewhat foolish.  Well, it didn't last too long and so for a replacement I read reviews, etc.  If you can get this item really cheap as a supplement it would be okay but wouldn't recommend.
I had an older Dell which I loved. I really hate this updated version  I had an older Dell which I loved.  I really hate this updated version.  It doesn't run as well as my other computer
Too slow to be really functional  The battery life is only about 2 hours and the RAM cannot keep up with multitasking very well. I have had difficulty on several occasion connecting to WiFi for whatever reason. The connection speed between web pages is very slow which makes it inefficient for someone looking for a portable way to complete college coursework. I am not sure I would even recommend it for a young adult since their expectations of computer equipment are even higher than the average adult. I would return it and get my money back if I could do so.
After one month I start having lots of problems connecting to wifi and the laptop starts to turn off due to some issue while I'm doing some work on which makes lose everything I was doin and then I had to start all over again
it does not have 1TB HDD SCAM.
Anyway I'm very happy with it  It's vry fast with the Intel Celeron Processor. Can withstand anything you throw at it. -Unfortunatelly it's a little bit larger and heavyer than I was expecting. -It is Slow at processing raw photos and video files and the fan starts spinning full speed, but then calms down,  you almost  don't hear it even in a very calm evironment.  Anyway I'm very happy with it. EDIT After one and a half year, the battery died. Now it's useless.
I spent about $1300 on my Hewlett-Packard - HP Pavilion dv7 a couple years ago. It has beats audio and bluray player so yes, an HD display.  Within a 2 or 3 months I had to return it for service because the HDMI port was dead. They had to replace the motherboard.  From that time on the internet was quirky.  Several times I called and went through various protocols to rectify the issue. Tried different drivers. It would creep along from as slow as 1 to 3 mbps at my house with 50 mpps service and at times it would jump up to 20 mbps. Turns out HP failed to reinstall the antenna for the bluetooth or adapter.  I figured that out when I took it to a service person when the hard drive crashed about 6 months ago.  They corrected that but I have noticed that my cat5 internet connection does not work at all any more. It used to be sporadic. About 9 months ago I noticed it kept heating up so I would make sure to turn it off when not in use and disconnect the battery. It still works but there is a noticeable bulge in my laptop case. :/  It still heats up from time to time so I just keep blowing out the vents and turning it off when it does. When it works, it's great but this laptop has truthfully been a nightmare for me.  Maybe I got the runt and it is an exception but I cannot recommend this product. P.S. The HDMI wireless adapter which I purchased separately but with my Laptop from HP works great,(Allows me to display my content on my TV wirelessly so we can use it as a streaming movie player with Netflix and Vudu and to share online pages or content with family or others, and allows me to play Bluray discs because I use it as a blueray player).
the computer is to cheep looking and i don't like it for the price i paid for it  the computer is to cheep looking and i don't like it for the price i paid for it. The cover already broke. its to flimzy. But its still working. I guess i have to see how long its gonna last. Im hoping it last for a year.
Amazing except critical battery bug  This is a fantastic computer, except for the fact that 6 months after I bought it the battery just stopped working and it will only turn on when plugged in.  The battery is full, but if you unplug the power cord it immediately dies.  Working with Toshiba support to get it repaired/replaced as it's under warranty.
It says 12 hour battery life but once its fully charged i get only 5hrs and 35 min. In addition the speakers doesnt work right when i got it(about one hour in watching youtube videos). Theres also numerous complaints about the audio failing. [...]. and this site as well [...]. I don't know what these reviews from other people are saying. Its either one they are working for them or two they got a lucky laptop.
I WILL NEVER BUY A LENOVO AGAIN!!!!!  Big piece of crap I have owned. I have had to call three times since I received this product in Feburary. On second call they had me mail it in to replace the hard drive. Received it back and a week later it was experiencing issues. Called them and told it not covered under warranty as it sounds like a software issue.
computer no good unless Windows can be activated  Could not activate Windows, invalid product number, emailed company and got a BS answer, computer no good unless Windows can be activated. I don't recommend buying from this company.
My MacBook turned out to be a LEMON!!  I am an IT product manager for a large nationwide AV technology company. I specify and recommend IT products to our many locations. I will no longer recommend Apple products based on my own personal experience. This laptop has given me nothing but issues over the 1+ year I owned it. I won't go over the minute details, but basically it was in for repairs at least 5-6 times to replace the battery, hard drive, random reboot, discoloration on the plastic, SuperDrive, etc.  The last issue I had was just this week. The screen began to flicker constantly and I was about to take it to my local Apple store when my wife accidently spilled water on the keyboard. As I said before, the logic board (motherboard) was already defective before the spillage. Because of the water damage, even though I have AppleCare, the repair is not covered--Apple wants close to $1000 for parts/labor to repair a system that at this point, it's not even worth that anymore. I can't believe the Mac "genius" even suggested repairing it when a new unit costs that much.  I have always been a big Apple fan for many years and have owned many of their products. I have bought and recommended Power Macs G4/G5, MacBooks/Pro, iMacs, CinemaDisplays, MacPros, you name it! Many of our locations complain about the premium price that our company pays for an Apple product as opposed to a Dell system. After the way I've been treated by Apple, I no longer feel that the premium price for a Mac system is worth it.
Heated up and crashed repeatedly so had to return
VERY<VERY<VERY  Bad Sight
Stopped working at all after having it 6 months. Pretty sure it's a Dell mother board issue not about to pay for a new one since the warranty was up
THIS IS RATING IS FOR ACER'S CUSTOMER SERVICES and EXPIRED WARRANTY  Something good about this laptop after my 1st time use: (1)I am buying this as an emergency use for my parents. I had one day shipping and it delivered on time. Five Starts (2) As it says 3lbs, pretty light and a very handy size. Five Starts (3)fast charging Something I am not happy with: SLOWWWWWWW!! To be clear, I know what is " fast "  mean since I have four devices at my home: 2 laptops (one Alianware and one Mac Air)and 2 desktops (two Dells with self upgraded hardware ) But this laptop is for my parents... i guess it is fine.  OKAY, YOU SHOULD READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY ANY ANY ANY ACER'S PRODUCTS:  WHY did I give its customer services one star?  What happened: I bought this ultra book and found out it doesn't have a build-in CD reader/writer. I have an old one so I plugged it in and realized somehow the laptop did not recognize it. At the time I wasn't sure about the reasons (was the reader already broken or was the system's set up problem? ) so I did some google researching and called the customer services.  1) it's NOT FREE to ask any question / help to any technicians . I remember I was told to pay about $20 (or more) to ask for JUST ONE help. what is interesting, is you will be hardly to find the price on its website.  2) I was surprisingly known  (MAYBE I AM THE ONLY ONE) that this NEW laptop I bought came with an EXPIRED  warranty (really? even today is my first day to own it).  "The serial Number entered is not eligible for extended warranty coverage. Please confirm serial number entered or contact Customer Support"  (Hello! )  3)RUDE INDIAN REPRESENTATIVE ..Sorry,  I am not an Indian hater or what.. just because I was warned by that Indian guy that I shall not try to fix anything by myself because I could possibly make the things more complicate. (question: why and how can I make the problem more complicate if I just going to buy a new portable CD reader? where on the earth he got this conclusion and judged on me? ) I told him I will pay for a help later if I find out it's not the problem with my old CD reader. He just kept saying I am not knowing what I am doing. SO I was angry because he did not understand me and tried to make me think I am stupid.  Finally, I went to the bestbuy which is one block away from my home and got a new portable cd reader, cost me 35 dollars. and it works fine. I am glad I didn't pay that 20 dollars first which would make me to be a real Idiot!  One last thing to add,  when I received the package, it has a tag with 316.00 and on it says Wal Mart....  thank you for reading my comment. I might have some attitude showed but I have tried to be fair  ( I was still angry when I typed about all this).
Non-stop problems since I purchased it just 8 months ago. I've had to repair the screen twice because it randomly keeps glitching. It crashes at least three times a week and restarts with completely different settings. I've had to replace the charger twice. I got it for $200 and even that wasn't a deal. Do NOT purchase.
Received and Returned the same day  I tried it and was disappointed. You get what you pay for is the cliche thing to say but my experience is I got the computer one day and returned it the same day. iTunes wouldnt load and the App Store didn't work and Gmail didn't work, but safari worked. I spent the extra $300 on a quality Apple computer and I felt a lot better.
Poor quality with absolutely no warranty support.  Purchased 6 mo ago and worked fine until a week ago, now essentially bricked.  Takes 10 min to boot, 5 minutes waiting after clicking on anything.  DVD drive no longer recognized.  Restored OS with no change.  Customer support from ASUS is non-existent.  Warranty card says to got to website to get customer service phone number for RMA but that process is simply not there.  There's just the ability to email tech support that nobody replies to.  Avoid ASUS like the plague.
I don't like it
Same, WiFI Fail, motherboard fail  I just saw one pup up on craigslist for sale and decided to look here first before I bought ANOTHER one. My wife bought hers and right at the year mark the WiFi failed. We took it to a shop who said the motherboard was going out and they could prolong it with a wireless adapter. We used that fot a little while and it finally failed. We still use the paptop, but with a ethernet cable plugged into it. For some reason it stays a lot cooler like this and does not crash anymore. I considered getting it repaired with a new MB and then I saw this one pop up on craigslist. Now that I have seen these reviews I will just cut my losses.
Wifi doesn't work  I bought this laptop about a year ago, but after upgrading it to Windows 10, it's wifi stopped working, and still doesn't. I am currently looking for a new laptop.
Like others had said  Like others had said, it didn't come with Office365 as advertised. That was fine if Asus was willing to provide the code later on. I went on Asus website and filled out their request form for the passcode. Now it has been a month and Asus hasn't send anything. Calked their customer service. They were not willing to help. Told me to go ask microsoft when it is their responsibility. Beside poor customer support the laptop is okay for the price. Make sure you get Office 365 if you buy.
Not happy  Not happy with this one to compliated to figure my others were easier
Broke after 5 months of light use.  Really enjoyed using this laptop. Unfortunately, it broke after 5 months of light use (the screen has gone permanently white). I am also unable to return the product as the warranty is only good for less than 2 months. Very, very disappointed. Would not buy again.
Keyboard malfunction  I received this item half of my keys did not work trying to prepare for school and can't get work done since I have to send it back
Crappy computer.  Definitely not worth the price, i don't know if it was just this computer i bought, or if all the inspiron 15 5000 series suck. When i try to open the internet, half the time it won't open.  When i try to do simple tasks, like open file explorer it literally takes 5 minutes... that is supposed to take a split second.
Not what I expected.  It's an okay laptop. I've had it for a month now and it's still slow. It takes forever to open a window or even to operate simple tasks.
Hard disk died after 10 months and when we took Mac to Apple authorized service center, they told us that we can't repair it under the warranty as it was not an original apple hard disk. We have never opened Mac.
3 Months old and broken  I bought this 3 months ago and the motherboard is already broken. Whatever it is that regulates the flow of electricity went bad already. I can't find out where the warranty information is. Awesome.
Screen went crazy and stopped working after 6 months.
the machine is fantastic and 5 stars as everyone else has commented on  Giving 1 star to get your attention (related to 100 MB 4G LTE), the machine is fantastic and 5 stars as everyone else has commented on. The 1 star is for 2 specific capabilities that we paid a premium for: 1) the fact that the 'included monthly 100mb of data' is actually a trial period and not a monthly 100MB as stated in the description and 2) the modem is HARDWARE LOCKED to Verizon (and likely, but not confirmed, T-Mobile). After spending a couple of hours researching and chatting with google support, this was confirmed; there is no way to 'unlock' the modem from Verizon (or T-Mobile) as you can with other phones and tablets, the lock is part of the modem itself and there is no command line to enable ATT or international sims.  Outside of the cellular modem lockdown, this is an excellent machine, although a bit pricey (pun intended).
I absolute hate this  laptop. Do not buy it!
Died before it's time.  It lasted 13 months (one month longer than the warranty) and now needs a new motherboard.  I'm reluctant to buy a $300 replacement part for a $400 computer.
Broke 6 months later  Was fine, now it just won'the turn on, out of the clear blue.
Product was delivered on time and never worked.  Absolute junk.
If you want a laptop to be a constant headache and last less than one year then buy this one.  Constant problems. Keyboard went out after one year!!!!!
False advertising.  Upon initial inspection just out of the box there is no disc tray! Being able to burn CDs was one of my deciding factors for purchasing this computer, and it clearly doesn't have that capability.  Edit: Less than a week after it arrived I turn it on a receive a screen telling me that the battery permanently failed and needs to be replaced. If I could rate 0 stars I would. Needless to say I am returning this computer.
Worst computer I've ever used  Worst computer I've ever used.  Takes forever to download anything or open any file.  Won't hold an internet connection.  I will never buy another Acer product.
The computer itself may be a good one I wouldnt know  I never reicieved this item from Stacking Paper. The computer itself may be a good one I wouldnt know.. sorry
Terrible  I purchased this computer for my daughter for college it basically has not worked since we purchased it.  When I called Dell they basically said I could send it in to be repaired for a $259.00 or so because it is insure for a year but not for what they think is the problem.  REALLY I ended having an IT friend fix it and she went back to school and again not working now telling her she has no hard drive on a brand new computer.  Very annoying and Dell not the best to work with
chromebook  Cheap, slow..you get what you pay for.  I sent it back.  Did not like at all. Love the chrome cloud thing, but computer sucked.
This laptop is unforgivably slow when booting up. It can take up to 10 minutes for windows to turn on and for all background applications (e.g. dropbox, skype, etc) to fully open. Given this laptop's stated processing power, its performance is miserable. The laptop is reasonably prices and if its all you can afford and need a laptop, this will ultimately do the trick for you. But if you can afford an extra 150 to 200 dollars, then definitely avoid this laptop.
Fair Warning Before Buying!  my laptop outlived it's two year warranty before it became unusable. The firmware on my motherboard was corrupted somehow and would cause my computer to crash unexpectedly after only a few minutes of use. Reformatting would only solve the problem for about 30-45 minutes before the same problem would surface. I took it in to a highly rated professional who couldn't figure it out, and even had another client come in with the same issue on the same laptop, except they had three of them, all with the same problem. It is a great looking laptop with a huge display and ran great while it worked, but it's a time bomb with a two year fuse. I will be replacing the motherboard in order to salvage the rest of the machine, purchase at your own risk. I bought mine five years ago so hopefully the problem has been fixed.
SSD don't work  In less than 4 months of use, my 24 GSSD HD does not work !!!!!!!!!!!and my computer is not starting.
Hope it doesn't crash.  I bought one of these for gaming and coding, which crashed before I was even able to complete the online registration.  After that, each attempt to restart the computer resulted in it powering itself off before booting.  I was more than willing to allow for the possibility that it was just a fluke and requested a replacement which Amazon helped me with in a friendly, time efficient manner.  After having the new machine for less than 3 days, it pulled the same stunt.  I hit the power button, heard the fan start and the drive spin for just a second before the power indicator went off.  This made me rather sad because it really is an attractive unit and the specs suggest a lot of potential, but ultimately I found this machine unreliable...at best.
Flawed thermal design  First of all, this laptop is a BEAST, it is really cheap compared to other laptops with similar processing power, however there is 1 huge problem.  The chassis of this laptop was designed for 2x 650M VGA and because of this the 2x 750M are having heat issues due to the higher voltage and clock speeds. The built in main 750M is okay for most models (however many are factory defective and does not have thermal paste applied properly), however the Ultrabay VGA may be a deal breaker for many people.  The 650M in the Ultrabay can operate on relative acceptable temps (max 176F-185F), however the higher clocked 750M (and also the 755M) with higher core voltage will reach 208F in a matter of minutes and starts to throttle with GPU intensive games, like Crysis 3, Bioshock Infinite, Witcher 2, etc.  The reason for this is that the Ultrabay in this model was designed for 650M, which means: a) The fan is too small b) Technically there is almost no point where the fan could take in air, there is only a small hole at the bottom of the laptop c) There is an aluminium casing inside, surrounding the Ultrabay slot which will eventually overheat and retain the heat  I have to note that even though the Ultrabay VGA reaches throttle temperature, the ultrabay fan will not start to work on maximum RPM, currently the only way to use the fans on maximum RPM is to use the dust removal service in the Lenovo software. Running the fans on maximum would help the ultrabay vga, but Lenovo does not allow it, probably because the laptop would be too loud and people would complain because of that.  Repasting the ultrabay vga will not do anything. A notebook cooler can help to lower the cpu and built in VGA temp, but it will not help the Ultrabay VGA, it only makes it reach throttle temp slower.  In short: A beast of a laptop regarding speed, however the Ultrabay slot is not designed to hold a 750M/755M and the VGA inside it will overheat with any game that utilize 99% of the VGA.  It is okay with games like Skyrim and X-Com EU, but Crysis 3, Bioshock Infinite, Witcher 2, etc will fry the Ultrabay. Please keep this in mind when you purchase.
Worst computer I have ever purchased  Worst computer I have ever purchased. Always slow, when I press the start button it will not turn on but makes a clicking noise.
