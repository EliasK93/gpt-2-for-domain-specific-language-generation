Disappointed...but not surprised  I read a few reviews that were poor and stated that the machine could not updates Windows 8, but most of the reviews were positive and this seemed to be the best bang for the buck in my son's price range so we ordered it and hoped for the best. He was ecstatic to have his first laptop all to himself. We got it set up and did all the updates. Now it doesn't work. It says..."Failed to updated Windows. Reverting updates. Do not turn off computer" and just gets stuck there. Has anyone successfully resolved this issue? I'm sending it back to Amazon tomorrow but I'm still deciding whether to order the same computer and hope for a better result or order something else. It seemed like a fine computer otherwise.
Sending it back  What a disappointment. Machine is terribly slow (my computer guy says this is probably because it is a refurb). Specs say battery power up to 4.25 hours, but fully charged it tells you it is only good for 2.5 and I think that is better than it really gets. Keyboard has strange uncomfortable spacing and touch pad is difficult to use. All in all, much less machine than the 4 year old HP laptop it was supposed to replace. It is going back.
Windows has expired when it says it comes with it  I just received my computer and it say that windows has expired when in the details it said it was good???
Started day one of my new laptop with issues powering on, or staying on for more than a few minutes, days of trouble-shooting and it will only operate in certain power saver modes. Now, well it works, sort of, can't really load videos or games reliably, at least if you aren't willing to wait forever and refresh often. Tons of troubleshooting and no real help. Also, make sure you read the warranty and amazon return policy. You cannot exchange, bought it for a deal, now, while it should have out-performed my desktop it crawls at a slower pace than my 2008 laptop and well, I am stuck with it.
Laptop won't open, Hoorah... =.= Forget booting up, power button doesn't even work...
A piece of junk . Period!
Awful product matched by awful customer service!  Awful. Awful. Awful. So painfully slow. Will not even use it. Hate it. And Dell's customer services matches this horrible product with terrible customer service. Have been transferred to 17 people trying to resolve an issue and have spend 6 hours so far. Still no help and no resolution. So upset!
Not DOA but on full life support  I bought this for a friend whose key requirement was portability, not performance. Even with performance in the back seat, I elected to go with a Celeron based machine as I was concerned an Atom based one lacked the minimum horsepower to make a user happy. The computer showed up with the usual prompt Amazon delivery and seemed in good condition on arrival. That's the last of the "good" statements you'll see. During the initial power up, the machine autonomously shut down. I hadn't paid too much attention up until that time as my friend was certainly capable of running through the new user initialization screens. After a second shutdown, I became more involved. It made it through to the desktop on the third try and I assumed it was some sort of learning curve issue until it instantly closed out of Windows 8 while doing essentially nothing. At this time, it wouldn't even boot properly and shutdown before hitting the windows screen. The second attempt brought up a screen asking about whether to try correcting Windows. Figuring there was certainly something wrong, it seemed reasonable to say, "Yes" and it went though it's correction routines. We were then able to get it to boot properly. Again I made the assumption the problems were Windows based and transient in nature. After downloading Skype, I was talking to my son when the machine shut off, instantly. Like the other times, this wasn't an orderly shutdown but rather as if someone had just pulled the plug (yes, this is a laptop but you get the drift. For what it's worth, the configuration for the first couple of boot attempts were on the battery which was fully charged but after that, I  plugged the machine in to ensure there wasn't some sort of battery issue). We did another start and this time it stayed up for about 15 minutes. Two more shutdowns and I hit the Amazon return button.  I wanted to like this machine because if it had worked, it would have been an ideal machine for its intended use. The screen was certainly adequate and while the keyboard was small for my hands, I'm sure a person could get used to touch typing on it. Two USB ports allowed me to hook a portable DVD drive to it and it read and installed software fine. Unfortunately, there was a quality (or design) problem. I did an internet search for Windows 8 autonomous shutdowns and didn't find any results so it appears to be on the hardware side. When I ordered I was concerned about Acer quality and in this instance, it appears they cut one too many corners and lost a sale. It's difficult to objectively rate a computer that arrives with a hardware problem. Without the problem I encountered, it might be a great machine so giving a one star rating based on an obviously defective machine is a bit harsh. I'm sure this isn't the typical computer but I felt I couldn't rate it higher than two stars because even though it had potential, Acer quality control wasn't up to preventing defective machines from making it to end users and any buyer needs to be aware of this.
Disappointing.  Setup only took about 20 minutes. Not bad. Unfortunately, that was the only thing that was positive about this. I tried to go with the Windows 10 upgrade. After 3 hours, the download part had only progressed about 25%. I stopped the download, and went ahead with my regular light web browsing. Visiting different websites for homework was mediocre at best, and I had good Wireless strength. A couple of days later, I got back on it for more browsing, and even simple websites such as Google loaded at the speed of dial-up. Not to mention that the computer and its programs had went unresponsive several times. This evening, I started it back up. Boottime was excellent. I put in my password to my Microsoft account, and I sat watching the spinning dot-wheel thing, and all that I saw was "Welcome" for several minutes. It never booted into the start menu. I packed it up and have asked Amazon for a refund after only one week. A total waste of $300, but at least I'm getting it back. My tip to anyone who considers buying this is, don't be cheap. Spend a couple hundred extra, and you probably won't be disappointed. In this case, I definitely got what I paid for, and that is the most expensive paperweight.
Not what I expected.  The slide screen is constantly moving when you are trying to type something it is always going back to the home screen causing me to start all over again. It will jump to your pictures out of the blue . very unstable.
... excited because of its specs to only be very disappointed with the panel it comes with  I received the laptop today and was so excited because of its specs to only be very disappointed with the panel it comes with.  It seems very fast but it is unbelievable that for this amount of money, the panel has a lot of texturing/cloudiness when viewing whites and greys in it probably due to the touch screen.  I ordered an Asus Zenbook Pro UX501 weeks ago and returned it for the same reason.  I ordered an Asus Zenbook UX303ub from Amazon and it came from Upgrade Kings that has 20Gb of ram, a 512Gb ssd and 2Gb graphics card.  The processor in the Zenbook is only a dual core and the graphics card in it is nowhere near the performance of the 970m that comes in the Razer, but value wise, the Zenbook beats it hands down.  The Zenbook is opening applications faster than the Razer which isn't that important but that shouldn't happen either. And what amazes me is for so much less money, the panel on the Zenbook is way better than the Razer which is why I am holding on to the Zenbook.  What a deal breaker...Razer needs to get their act together and upgrade their panels as I have read they are a couple of years old now.  I am sending it back tomorrow and waiting for the Macbook Pro to come out in the fall because I can count on them to have an incredible panel....my 15" 2015 Macbook pro with lower screen resolution was much better than the one that comes in the Razer and spent close to the amount of money on my MBP that I did on the Razer.  Nobody makes panels as well as Apple..not even Dell.  I just don't get what the big deal is with the Razer now and will probably never consider one again.
Not to happy  It worked for like a week an started messing up and freezing. Wouldn't even let me on the internet. I didn't do nothing to it but try to use it. I was a little disappointed.
Hard drive problems  I got one of these to take on a trip, during which the machine limped along with a specific problem -- after a random amount of time running, anywhere from 30 seconds to about an hour, it would freeze and reboot. This would always happen with the hard drive light stuck on, making me think the problem was with the hard drive. When I got back, I returned it to Amazon for a replacement. That came quickly and at first seemed fine. Great in fact. I liked the keyboard, I like Windows 7, the machine feels pretty nippy. It wakes up very quickly and is really small and lightweight. Then after two days it too developed a hard drive problem. This time it wouldn't boot at all. I returned it to Amazon for a full refund. Amazon's processing of returns was great. In my experience, the unreliable hard drives Toshiba uses sabotage this otherwise excellent product.  One more gripe, though this isn't specific to the Toshiba Mini - Windows 7 starter edition, which is the operating system that comes with this laptop, doesn't let you set your own desktop background. The desktop you get has a big Microsoft Windows logo. The software is intentionally nobbled so you can't change it. I find that pretty offensive.
DO NOT BUY IT.  Had it since late 2014. Quite a powerful machine, loved most of it except the seemingly flimsy build. It ran very smoothly, exceptionally well actually, till about 2 days ago when it just went off and won't come back on again. This is despite checking the charger and the battery which seem to be OK. A bit of research over the internet shows that the motherboards for the HP Envy line of laptops have a knack for malfunctioning or plain going dead with the only option being replacement (this is a gamble).  I've had laptops that have lasted over 5 years with no problems. This one, while quite powerful, has lasted me less than 2 years, and it has left me quite disappointed. I would therefore not recommend it for purchase, unless one has a less than 2 year turn over goal for their machines.
Good for a few weeks. Then goes dead.  This computer worked for a few weeks. But slowed down and stopped working last week. I tried to use the recovery system. But that only made it worse. I had to purchase a copy of windows to get this computer to start working
Don't use amazon for this computer  <div id="video-block-R1ZU786HGEI3AF" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/917nIfItmNS.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CBug6fidS.png" class="video-slate-img-url">&nbsp;Wish it would be negative 5 stars. I'm writing a bad review because of Amazon not the computer itself. When I received my computer the picture was going in and out and the best way to describe it is an epileptic nightmare. I take it to geek squad and they tell me that it was a problem with the motherboard. So how exactly is a brand new computer system already have problems and now I have to return it.
Terrible product  I bought an averatec computer and within 4 months it crashed. The customer service reps are not helpful in the least bit, I believe they haven't a clue about computers. I would not recommend this product to anyone who wants a reliable computer.
this laptop lacks a cd/dvd drive  No where is it listed that this machine did NOT come with a cd/dvd drive.  I wouldn't have purchased it if I has known that.
and it has trouble finding wifi when other laptops are just fine. Avoid  The bloatware removal is absolutely mandatory to make it work. Sadly, it does not meet the hardware requirement to install Windows 10. Also, the wireless card does not work well, and it has trouble finding wifi when other laptops are just fine. Avoid.
Windows 10 Home was pre-installed - but was not activated. Laptop would not update due to not being activated, may not be a legal copy of windows 10 provided with item.  Clean install required with new windows disc will be required to fix this issue. .  would not recommend purchasing from this seller due to this
Don't buy Lenovo  I very disappoint from this laptop. Its made from very cheap everything! Keyboard: The keyboard is not pleasant to work with. Anything that fall inside the keyboard even small dust, stop the key. Bezel: Many part of the bezel made from very cheap plastic. This is a laptop, and while traveling, the plastic breaks apart. Parts: After 4 months of using, the HD is dead! Service: the service is terrible as the laptop. 2 months to replace the HD! This is a true story!
Laptop arrived dead---never powered up :-(  The laptop never powered-up. Trying to get it resolved through a local authorized dealer.
Problem with the MousePad  I've had this computer for 6 months. The system works well, but the mousepad is a disaster and makes all use of it frustrating.  It's not responsive - I have to press the left-click button 1-3 times to get it to work.  It is also not an ergonomic key pad.  Think about this before you buy, the buttons are ineffective, and positioned for elf hands - I've never had hand strain in 15 years of computing until this HP! My wife's Dell is the opposite - easy buttons and ergonomic.  I only use my HP with a different mouse in the USB port.   It has shut down once or twice for no reason, and sometimes won't start without pressing the "reset" button, but otherwise it's been smooth riding with the system itself.
it's not a serious store
Would not recommend this to anyone  Didn't take a charge right out of the box, awful product. Would not recommend this to anyone. Stay away from this.
Crashed after three months  After installing Windows 8.1, the computers hard drive crashed and would not reboot. Dell is going to replace the hard drive or the whole thing for me, but I lost some of my work. It will take 7-10 business days to receive my replacement laptop. I like the Toshiba that I have had for years better than the Dell.
Acer Laptop Screen quit working Twice within First Year  The screen quit working after only 4 months.  They "fixed" it.  Then it quit working again after only 4 more months.  It costs you a ton of money and time to have to ship for repair poor quality products that break so quickly..  Think twice before buying an Acer.
Six months of Despair  This laptop, with the Microsoft operating system is awful!!!!  Pictures won't download, printer won't install, the screens flash on and off. Always restarts. Errors... Very upset, wish I could return it, but it is too late.
Avoid Until Dell Fixes Their Issues  The issue I have is that you have to restart your computer to have the internet browser working. After spending hours with Dell support they are not able to solve the problem. The laptop has the latest drivers and diagnostic checks. Seems like Dell released a bad product.
nice computer but it has issues.  Purchased December 2011.  Reviewed July 2012 This is a nice speedy computer, but there is an issue with the power connector on the PC.  Something went wrong and it fried the power adapter.  Bought a new power adapter and it fried that one too.  Now Asus has had it for over a week and no ETA for repairs to be complete.
Chrome is a toy, not serious business or even play  If you don't work & don't play hard - this "computer" (toy) is for you. But I feel sorry for you, folks. I'd rather swim in Tuxedo, than pretend that ChromeOS is a working OS, Chrome browser is a real WebBrowser, and Gmail can be employed for professional/business use.  I love Goodle for their core product - search Internet & Global Maps/Positioning, but to pretend Chrome toy is a business OS or serious home OS - is a fallacy. I am the one, by the way, who wrote to Google when it was still a few engineers within Yahoo's research division, back in 1996 or 1998 (been long time, don't remember exactly) to keep search's GUI simple versus bloated at that time and still now Yhaoo's interface, they listened, thanks, that's why Google is so sleek search-wise. But PLEASE don't tell me this ChromeBook or ChromeOS, Chrome Browser, Chrome this & that - is a serious product.  It is a toy. If you're a kid or 90 years old and only care for primitive "letterz & stuff..." - this tiy is for you.  YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOE.  If you pay for..... you get .... back (I can't type some words in a public domain)  For anyone with serious needs, please analyze what can industry do for you for $250-300, no much. If you want to be cheap, light, ultraportable, and STILL a "real" Netbook - a better deal is I got a $500 HP DM1Z with Windows7, Intel SSD 240MB enterprize edition or similar (?), AMD APU-based (not ARM) E-1800, the system runs for 9+hours on a single charge, weighs nothing, thin like Mac Air, not a full sized laptop but way better than ChromeBook. I ended up EVEN running Adobe Photoshop on it with not too bad results, its main strength is discrete-class video yet physically built into APU (CPU with Video). It costs mere $230 more than this toyful ChromeBook.  I mean, if you go for ChromeBook, why not pretend your Android SmartPhone is a laptop too - just connect external display via Miracast protocol, keyboard/mouse via WiFi and enjoy your "clever savings" - it saves a whopping $200 over a real laptop with Windows or Linux ============================================================================  UPDATE (10Feb2014): I WISH TO POINT OUT: The repeated mentioning of "Chromebook.. boots instantly" is no more instantly than my multiple machines with Intel SSD as boot device +AND (important) proper management of startup processes! On your Windows machine, do following: boot, wait 5 minutes, rightclick on taskbar-->TaskManager-->Processes, read bottom/statusbar, how many do you have running for all users? I bet a huge number!  My count is: 21 TWENTY ONE processes is all I allow to load. People complaining on Windows booting forever or say for 10 minutes, did not manage the rubbish they allow to loadup/startup, ya'll have those "useful" utilities loading from Adobe autoupdate to windows autoupdate to audio enhancements to lame AOL or another messenger and a pile of others taking precious processing time to load and maintain in memory RESIDENT. +PLUS Many of you complaining on Windows, allow Antiirus+AntiSpyware programs run at all times (real-time), but how come I've never been infected at home & yet no Antivirus/AntiSpyware is easting away CPU/memory/diskIO cycles here? My Windows machines boot like a solidstate device, well in fact they boot off Intel SSD's, but I emphasize it is NOT merely SSD or whatever bootdevice, it is the absence of myriad useless memory hogs loading at startup, which most of you allow.
SSDD  Do NOT buy this.  Mine worked well for a month or so and then all of a sudden started freezing and crashing multiple times per HOUR!!! I found out I was not alone.  I found all kinds of other people with the same problem or worse.  It is now 2 months old and I cannot return it.  I will talk with Acer. Just google Chromebook support page and have a good read at our expense.
Net Flix stopped Streaming, I tried to Return/Exchange but policy prohibits
horrible!  did not work.. wifi would not connect and could not update drivers from website because of a update.ccp 1203 error
Defective product, did not look new, bad packaging.  The battery was not charging. Computer had scratches and stains. The packaging boxes were filled with dirty old newspaper pieces and looked like junk. Had to return it back.
NO DVD drive  I was very disappointed to learn that this Asus laptop does not actually include a DVD drive, despite advertisements stating so, both by Asus and Amazon." There is NO DVD drive in this model
We were told it wasn't an issue and would work fine. That is great  We record this in and set this laptop up at a local computer store. We noticed right away the paper light didn't stay lit.  We were told it wasn't an issue and would work fine.  That is great, however, 7 months in and the power cord doesn't work, it can't be detected so now we can't charge the laptop. I can't find anyone to help with this either. Not happy with my purchase like this from amazon.  I would recommend going to a computer store where you can get the help needed, especially when it's under warranty.
Don't get it sucks.  This iRULU broke down after two times of turning it on, and now I cant return it because Its too late. Don't get it sucks.
Junk that worked great until it didn't  Failed motherboard about 1 month after warranty. Until then it was great, and I was amazed at the handwriting recognition capability of Windows on this product. Perhaps the new generation will be much more capable. This thing ran fairly hot (thermally) and I think the inability to manage that heat was the problem/
does not work  I took it to the Geek squad  at Best Buy,to transfer info from another mac,  they said it was faulty, they even sent it to their factory and didn't have the part to fix it,,so bought one fron eBay.
slow pc  Slowest PC I have ever owned. I gave it away and bought a good one.
It works but a let down from prior experience  Had it for some weeks now. Not impressed. I liked my old model of a ROG Asus that I bought as a refurb from newegg for the same price (I paid $979 for *this* model; the price now is ridiculous) a few years ago. Wanted an updated replacement that was also more portable for school (old ROG was a 17"). So while this laptop manages to work, it does a sloppy job. Has an oddly difficult time PLAYING SOUND. How does that even..? For example, I play a video on youtube and it takes a whole minute for the sound to turn on. I thought maybe it was just a weird little hiccup back when I began to use it, but no, it really is faulty like that. It also has a loud fan, not obnoxious, but why are the fans on full throttle when, again, all I'm doing is streaming a video?  I am also very unhappy with the software that was included. Windows 8 was a pain as it is (bearable now), but then there's also all the Asusware, half of which is mediocre. (Plus additional bloatware like McAfee). Also when you name your optical drive playing software as movie magic, or whatever, it makes it sound like a video editing program. And then nothing, NOTHING you do can re-install this, not even factory settings. You have to dl something else. Asus customer service will tell you they don't *have the ability to replace software from their own company*. Okay, that's not difficult, but better customer service please. Pay attention to what customers who don't stop at newegg say. We are customers as well.  Overall, I knew I was going to win some and lose some by shelling out money for a smaller laptop. But for a few dollars away from a grand, it feels like a rip off. I liked Asus so much prior to this experience. My old ROG still functions, but again, it's a 17" and the updated screen on *this* model does look great (except for when you open anything other than a browser or windows program, e.g. Steam app. Then, more likely it isn't optimized for the sharp crisp look that is the IPS display so it looks like crap). While it doesn't concern me ATM, you DO want that SSD. I'm not a computer geek by any means, but I do my research as a consumer, and it is disappointing that a) this is more expensive here on amazon as of date and b) this is one of the better options out there in terms of its overall features for the price range. I mean, it shouldn't be, but it is and that is frustrating.  Anyway, I should reiterate, this laptop works fine, except for that strange audio glitch (which, you know, is pathetic since they hype up the sound engineering). The screen is very sharp. The machine is very portable. Games run well (I did Bioshock for a bit. Can't say for newer games. I don't recommend that. I am a sporadic gamer. The games run well and looks good and that's good enough for me). I suppose you should buy it if the context is the same: want a pretty update, something that works, is portable and plays games. Don't if you can wait and keep saving for a better packaged deal.
Will fail on you  The trackpad stopped working in the middle of a work trip 35 days after I bought the machine.
-  The laptop promptly arrived, looked and felt fantastic and if it worked as it should have, I'd have given it 5 stars but sadly it's performance deteriorated within 8 months of purchase under normal use. Here was my experience with this computer  Pros: - The computer display is gorgeous and the native windows scaling works well. - The SLI performance is decent enough to run the Division at medium settings, 40fps, 1080p mode. Most games that support SLI work and play well when scaled down to 1080p at Max settings. - Ability to turn off SLI for games that don't support it. - A very respectable 2.5h battery life for a gaming computer. - The comptuer is insanely fast with generic tasks.  Cons: - The 3K resolution doesn't work well with gaming. Games that even support SLI struggle to run at a playable 30fps at native resolution on medium - high settings. I found myself constantly scaling back to 1080p fullscreen mode all the time to play games with any degree of smoothness. - WiFi connectivity is extremely poor and there is little that can fix it. Essentially this laptop recieves signals up to ~5m away from any wifi router I've used either at home, or university. The connection speed dropoff was exponential as well. All other devices on the same networks performed just fine. - The microphone is atrocious. Seriously, I tried recording a lecture with it and the recording quality has to be the poorest I have ever witnessed. The volume was minimal, and the quality was so poor that most words were indistinguishable. Yelling at the microphone produced acceptable results during gaming sessions but I lost my voice fairly quickly. - [personal issue] The screen arrived with slight white discoloration at the center from the start. The discoloration proceeded to become more intense over the course of several weeks. I didn't return to amazon because i didn't feel like they would take the issue seriously and charge me a restocking fee. - [personal issue] Three months after purchase. the screen developed a yellow tint and the windows key stopped working. There was no damage to the computer, it all just happened out of the blue.  Things to Consider: - Not all games support SLI card configuration. The dual 965m cards work well enough to run the latest games at max settings, 1080p, +30fps, but scaling things to the 3k resolution grinds fps down to a halt, even more so if the games don't support SLI. - Several editing programs like lighroom and sony vegas pro that have the potential to use GPU acceleration don't work well with SLI setups. Even turning SLI off and relying on one card doesn't help editing things much faster. As such I wouldn't recommend this model to those who wish to do serious media editing.  Overall: Assuming I received a poor unit of this model and that others perform much better, I believe that the strongest and the weakest aspect of this computer is the 3K screen. The computer functions best with gaming as media editing on it is rather slow. Unfortunately the 3K resolution is too much for the two SLI cards to handle under max-quality gaming conditions and users have to make the trade-off between full-resolution vs max quality settings with their games. That's a trade-off that just should not be present for top-tier systems like this one considering it costs well over $2,000.
Never worked....started  Very disappointed with this tablet....very, very Waste of time......lost confidence in Samsung. It was nicely packaged....that is about all folks. But as they say.......it is not whats on the outside that matters
I was so excited to get this for my son and when it came and we started to set it well that when the excitement left.... because the touch mouse on the key board doesn't function right. .. so we had to run to a store to get a working mouse ....not what I expected and now my son says it's extremely slow... and will not hold his school work which is the whole reason for the purchase ....
Unfortunately, 2 defective machines  I wanted to love this laptop--beautiful display, monster specs, great price, and ASUS's good reputation.  I bought this model May 25, 2012 and unfortunately, the machine started slowing down, freezing up, then getting Blue Screens for no apparent reason within 48 hours out of the box.  I contacted Amazon, and happily, was able to get a replacement within a couple of days.  Life with the brand new replacement model was going well for a couple weeks, until it too, started exhibiting the same issues as the first!  It was too much of a coincidence.  Sadly, I had to return the second one for a refund as I didn't want to press my luck on a third replacement.  Too bad because I truly enjoyed the machine (both of them) up until the moment it croaked.  The majority of positive reviews for this machine seem to reflect the fact that for the most part, people received a great computer--if it worked.  A small handful of users, unfortunately, may have received duds.  A sad truth about mass manufacturing nowadays, but it happens :-(  Kudos to Amazon though for superb customer support.
Avoid  This is by far the worst laptop I have ever owned.  The desk top is completely unintuitive, and you're constantly being interrupted by software updates.  It is almost impossible to work with a document from an external thumb drive. And I have experienced multiple crashes, including one that wiped out three hours worth of work on the eve of a critical presentation, despite my repeated clicks on the save button.
HORRIBLE WIFI CONNECTIVITY  When I first received this computer I was fairly impressed with it. It is a very sleek computer with a modern design. It runs great and the touchscreen is very nice, but I would not recommend this laptop until the WIFI issue has been fixed.  The laptop has the worst wifi range of any device I own. My kindle fire has a longer range than the vaio 14 laptop. If im outside of 15-20ft of my router the laptop has 1-2 bars of connection in the same place where my older computer has full connection. This is outrageous for such a new computer. Unless you plan on leaving the Ethernet cable plugged in at all times DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP
Color and weight are perfect. However  Color and weight are perfect. However, When I open it, there is scratch on screen. so It bothers me now and I don't know why though It is new. and product key is not available so it couldn't activate. I requested ASUS for help regarding product key problem. but I want to solve this problem from you. so please reply to me asap.
