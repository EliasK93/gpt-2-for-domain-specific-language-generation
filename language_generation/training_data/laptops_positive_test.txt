Purchased this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it thanks
This laptop gets hot but theres an easy fix. "Update" important update for bios!  I purchased a slightly different version of this laptop off of best buy the only difference with there being no ssd (and the screen being a tn panel). I love experimenting with technology so the first thing I did after updating this laptop was download cpuz. I immediately noticed that while playing ds3 that my cpu temps were rising straight to 80-90c range, I was not happy at all to see those temps especially while using a cooling pad!  Solution: Open Power Options either by clicking the icon in the All Control Panel Options menu or by double-clicking the Windows battery icon in your system tray. Select Change plan settings next to the power plan you are using (balanced, power saver, etc). Select Change advanced power settings And change the max cpu power output to 85 instead of 100. After several tests my cpu now stays well withen the range of 65-70c and the same for gpu which is very solid for a laptop. Dont think of this as a loss in fps cause after testing I actually gained fps because my cpu no longer throttles due to high temps.  Its safe to say this cpu way more then out matches this gpu and by lowering its max power output you really aren't restraining anything other then perhaps certain times while playing and having too much going on in game like perhaps starcraft and even then you should be well in the range of 60 fps with this beast. Also I noticed the screen was a little to bright for my eyes and lowered it down to less then 50% with it still being a little too bright and noticed another 2c drop in temp hope this helps!:)  Update:  read into BIOS update 300 which doesn't appear to come stock maxes out fan speed at around 75c keeping temps much cooler. Using it myself with max power enabled, this tip is helpful if you you refuse to to avoid lowering performance at all costs. I'd post a link to the update but can't seem to post links here.   [...]
excelente.
Great specification.  Great specification.
Laptop arrived in excellent shape ,so I got started right up with no problems. Boot time is fine; no annoying fan buzzes or humming noises; the battery holds a good charge; power cord is in good shape with no fraying; malware and spyware scans found no issues; all four USB ports work fine; I'm fully satisfied.
This is hands-down the best laptop I've ever had  This is hands-down the best laptop I've ever had, and I've had a bunch. This thing is fast and the battery is lasting upwards of 9 to 11 hours, depending on what I'm doing. It's so thin & light it feels like I'm carrying a tablet around...absolutely love it. I'm a software developer, and I love to max out the RAM and SSD on machines, so at first I was a bit apprehensive when I realized I could only get 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB HDD, but then again, it's not my main machine. I'm not storing movies and music on here, so there's plenty of room. I've got Windows 10 Pro on it now, and couldn't be happier. I rarely use the touch screen though, because I'm so used to the track-pad, which is also very good. As soon as I realized I could tap once with 2 fingers simultaneously to simulate a right-click, I don't even click the track-pad hard anymore, I'm just barely touching it. The back-lit keyboard is amazing too when I'm sitting in bed and don't want to disturb my wife. There are two brightness levels. Oh, and I am flying on this keyboard. I'm just as fast as I am on a regular PC keyboard. I did my research, almost bought a Mac, and decided on this. No regrets here. I'm in thin light laptop heaven.
very very nice..... amazon made this a pleasant purchase. thin and very light. great features and price.
Amazing  Amazing product for the money. Definitely worth every penny.
Muy bueno
Double Dex is the best  Best MacBook ever. I bought 2 macbooks. They look and work like new only thing is they are much cheaper which is a good thing. Double dex is a great MacBook place they are the best.
Always a winner  Since 2003, I have always purchased Dell products & I haven't been burned yet.  They last forever with very little maintenance.
Chromebook works great--just what I needed !!
great chromebook  I love chromebooks and I am using my new toshiba chromebook 2 to type this review. It is a perfect size and looks very stylish. Also super fast and can do everything I need
Excellent!
i hate it
Love this brand  Gorgeous laptop. I have no had it for over a year with no issues. My old Asus is still ticking after 7 years and my daughter now uses it. Love this brand.
How did I compute without it?  I have been a diehard Windows user since the 3.1 days and never imagined in my wildest dreams I would ever own a Mac computer.  Well, after seeing them firsthand when I used to work for CompUSA, I finally decided it was time to switch.  I am SO glad I did!  I had the IBook out of the box and online in 15 minutes!  It took Windows that long to boot up and start the configurator!  OS X is very easy to navigate around that, aside from a few growing pains, I have been able to navigate like a pro.  I do miss the scroll button on my mouse, though I can live without that.  I love the sleep mode!!!  When I first heard of it, I had my doubts knowing how it never worked on Windows machines, but after having my IBook almost a week, I haven't had the need to shut it fully off yet.  I close the lid and come right back where I was!  I know some people take this as a canned motto, but it just works!  I tell it to do something and it does it!  That's exactly what I expect out of my computer!  Battery life is excellent and the built in Airport Extreme is faster I think that hardwired broadband internet.  Purchase this notebook and you will not be disappointed!
Steal of a Deal  If you are very handy with laptops and software upgrades then this is the computer for you.  Complete the system restore back ups immediately (4hrs. and 3 DVDs).  Go to the U.S. Acer website and flash the BIOS 1.31 as of Feb. 2010.  Update the drivers for LAN, WIFI, and Chipset.  Be sure to select the correct operating system. Also there is one "Application" on the Acer website called Optical Drive Power Management. This can correct the problem of not recognizing the DVD drive.  I had an existing upgrade to Windows 7 64 bit Home Premium and installed it with no problems. Remove the bloatware and McAfee.  Use AVG and Google Chrome and it will run fast enough. I can play 720p high definition videos with no latency with the right codec.  Benefits: 1. Well constructed gun metal aluminum (light) 2. IMHO the surround sound speakers are excellent, rich, detailed but not powerful 3. Battery life with heavy usage 6+ hours on balanced power setting 4. Boots with 1 minute on Windows 7 64 bit 5. Multi task with Office 2007 and with multiple web browser tabs open 6. Touchpad is excellent especially for schooling if you like touchpads 7. Widescreen HD looks terrific - no dead pixels 8. Runs extremely cool.  Drawbacks: This is not Plug & Play and requires some tech sweat equity. Single Core & Vista operating system. Overall: This is a fabulous notebook for the money. $399 during a refurbished sale.
Love it!  This computer is extremely fast and does exactly what I need it to for school. Only downsides are you cannot print from it unless you email it to yourself and print from another computer, no disk drive, and couldn't get a memory stick to read on it. Other than that it does great. Never knew anything at all about a chromebook until I made this purchase but now I know. Works for school and internet browsing great
My coworkers have come to love these little ultrabooks! With the SSD and 8GB of RAM  My coworkers have come to love these little ultrabooks! With the SSD and 8GB of RAM, they're much faster than some of the new units we were getting from Dell for 3x the price. Also helps that these are still using the older E-Series docking stations since we're hesitant to move the office over to the new USB-C docking stations. Only a matter of time before we're forced into that though!
Great value!
The Best!  Defnitely the best laptop you can buy. It's almost perfect and hats saying a lot considering how great their products are already. They just keep getting better and better, but this machine is so great it will last me a long time before another upgrade. Bravo!
Really great for the price.  I really love my chromebook and it does everything I want it to do. What I really love is the battery life because it takes 30 minutes to fully charge and the battery lasts for 10 hours. I bought it back when it was 300.
Perfect Machine; Perfect Service  Great machine, easily able to be upgraded to Windows 7.  The gentlemen at JSW were extremely helpful.  When I received this product, the DVD player/burner was not working (it happens when you are shipping sensitive electronic equipment).  But one email later, and after a small review of what the issue was...they replaced the DVD player/burner with no further delay or questions.  The DVD player/burner for this model is easily removable with the touch of a button, it pulls right out and the new one they sent me plugged right in and worked perfectly.
Pretty Neat Little Laptop  I think most of the reviews below are accurate but I'd like to add some points -  1) The keyboard is really very good.  The keys are a nice size given the overall size of this device. 2) Make sure and use the Microsoft IE 11 browser in Metro mode when you can.  It's really an incredible browser that allows you to take full advantage of the touch screen.  If you designate any other browser as the default browser, you lose access to the metro version of IE.  My advice - let IE be the default browser.  You can still use other browsers, they just won't be the default. 3) Understand that if you run this machine with lots of windows open and programs running, it will slow it down considerably.  You can do it but with only 2gb of ram and the nature of this processor, don't expect it to act like a full fledged laptop. 4) The screen bents to the point that the laptop is almost flat.  This is a really nice touch since it makes it easier to use the machine on things like exercise equipment. 5) I've found the touchpad to be pretty darn good.  And while you lose some space with the left and right mouse clickers, they two have a nice feel to them. 6) The power cord is good and long and there is no "brick" in the middle of the cord.  Just a fairly small converter at the point where you plug it in. 7) I've been getting good wifi reception.  And since I take it with me to the gym where it can be a challenge sometimes to get good wifi, I have to say I'm impressed. 8) If you are going to go with a smaller device that only has a 3 cell battery, you need a processor that is truly an energy miser otherwise you are looking at 2 hours of battery life  The intel processor in this machine is rated at 4.3 watts.  It really helps on battery life.  So what isn't good.  Actually there isn't much to complain about.  You do have to get used to the slower processor.  It's speedy by tablet standards but not so much compared to larger laptops.  Netflix and Youtube do just fine.  Okay, this review wouldn't be complete without a comment about Windows 8/8.1.  People who don't like it, don't seem to understand it.  That is understandable since Microsoft launched it with virtually no touch screen computers.  Get to know the features behind Windows 8 with or without the touch screen.  There is a lot good here...including the apps that are starting to get developed for the OS.  I have several that I use everyday and really enjoy.  Consider loading the free program Classic Shell if you want the full start button effect.  I have done it on every Windows 8 machine I've had  It allows you easy access to your legacy Windows programs as well as your Win8 apps.  The overall build on this machine is nice and coupled with Windows 8 makes it a winner.  I've been pleasantly surprised.
It is awesome
Great Laptop!  I am very impressed with this laptop. I needed something quickly because my old Dell laptop wasn't functioning well. This arrived to me sooner than expected and seller was very good about responding to some initial questions that I had. Overall, I am loving this new laptop! It's brand new and much improved from my older version. I love the look and functionality of it. The screen is nice and big for easier viewing, yet not too big. Laptop is fairly light given it's size. Haven't tested all the functionality yet since I just received it not too long ago, but so far it's great!
so i love my chrome book it was a little funky at first cause i wasn't familiar with this keyboard set up but now like i said i love it its starts up so fast without all the extra stuff my pc needs load i can just turn it on and hop straight on the internet totally glad i got this
Third Dell 6X0 I purchased form the vendor. the D630 is a very rugged. Had to buy a PCCard adapter to use the SD card.
Great little laptop for park guides in Rwanda  Good value for a laptop. We donate these to national park guides in Rwanda so they can go to college with the appropriate tools.
Very useful
shipment to india  This laptop is absolutely outstanding but I want seller's contact info to know more about payment and shipment
++++AAAAA
My Apple Macbook Pro  So far so well, or I guess i should say I Love It!!! This is my first Mac and I will have one from now on. Thank you Amazon for all your support and value.
Rock Solid Laptop  Pros: 1) Fast boot 2) Powerful graphics 3) Whisper quiet 4) Stays cool 5) Rock solid and dependable performance. 6) Upgrade accessibility is very good (easily and quickly converted 1 gig to 1 gig SSD) how to videos easily found on YouTube.  Cons: 1) The pre-installed Game First III software was causing me major connectivity issues playing GTA V Online, which plays beautifully on this laptop since uninstalling it.  (very high and ultra graphics easily achieved BTW) 2) My only beefs are the extra buttons, they are located right above the ESC key, just a personal peave, i like my ESC key to be the corner.  Now i risk launching the video streaming just due to habit, would have been better off centered. 3) Can't say I've used the steam button at all since I usually have it running on my taskbar and the full screen default is just way to big, i feel like I have to stand back to view it. 4) The ROG key is barely used as well, the application isn't all that expansive to warrant a dedicated button. 5) The red backlit panel is ok, but having a brighter color option or even color coding would have been a nice perk.  Overall i think the pros outweigh the cons, the pros are the important factors.  The only major issue was the game first III software, it really had me checking everything possible for my connectivity issues.  Been working flawlessly after removing it though.  Overall highly recommended.
Good quality MacBooks  Bought a used one, works just like a new one.
Great, but be weary  Most of what the other positive reviews say is correct.  There are a few cautions one needs to take though. Amazon's stock seems to have a large fail rate. The first one I bought had a corrupted recovery partition, so I got it exchanged. The second one had a scratch on the screen. The third and fourth had dead pixels. The fifth one seems to have no problem. I would strongly recommend buying this laptop, but you ought to buy it from a physical store, as exchanging defective ones would be a lot easier.  All in all, it seems to be a great laptop, it is just going to take a while to embrace it given the past experiences.
My wife received it a few days days ago. She definitely loves it. It it solid with a slim design and suitable for ladies. She use it for entertainment, watching movies, playing online games, and browsing internet, always runs fast. It is worth the money you paid.
Great laptop. Runs super cool and you can't hear it all. 5/5 great deal for the price.
HP ENVY 15t Quad was worth the buy  Beautifully slim and response fast.  Really getting use to the 8.1 OS and beginning to like the functionality.  For the price much better than buying a comparable Apple.
Everything i needed
Runs fast and touchscreen is a nice touch! Thanks!
Can't ask for a more powerful computer for the money.  This is an absolutely fantastic machine. Rather than talking about the good points, however, I find it more useful to talk about what I don't like about it, even though I've given it 5 stars and would highly recommend it to anybody looking for a powerful machine at an affordable price.  I've only come across only a few issues with it thus far. Right out of the box, the track pad is trash. The mouse button in part of the track pad so it is almost impossible to click something without moving the pointer. Anyways, I found out that it isn't the trackpad, it's the driver. To fix this, I just uninstalled the current driver, installed the one from Synaptics, and set a "deadzone" on the mouse so the button is not considered part of the track pad. The new driver also gives the user better control so you can really tinker with the settings. Now, the trackpack is fantastic.   Another issue is that it runs pretty hot when playing games or movies. This isn't that intolerable, but if you live in a hot climate and plan on having it on your lap, I'd recommend a cooling pad.  Third, it is bulky as hell. I have a Targus bag for a 15.6" laptop and it's a squeeze to get this laptop in the bag. When you do get it in there, it's heavy as hell and really wears on your shoulder after awhile. The power block is literally the size of a brick, and pretty heavy also. If you're looking for portability, then this is not the laptop for you. Lucky for me, I don't plan on lugging it around with me too much so the size is something I was completely expecting with the amount of hardware inside of this machine.  Finally, the battery life is subpar. I found that you can increase it by shutting off the SLI and lowering the screen brightness, but even then you are only looking at less than 3.5 hours. This means you have to lug that power brick around with you if you are going to be using it away from home. It also means that you're gonna be screwed if you don't have an outlet nearby. If you're really hard up, you can purchase a 9-cell battery for it, which supposedly increases the life to ~4.5-5 hours.
It looks nice keyboard feels nice  It's an alright laptop. It looks nice keyboard feels nice, and I just use it to write down notes, and does what I want it to do. SURPRISINGLY it can run League of Legends at a good 40-50 frames with everything on low. SO that was p cool.
Small Wonder  After waiting for a third revision of the 12 inch PowerBook, I decided to get one. I decided on the 12 inch because of the very portable size and the lower price. In addition to the standard features I opted for 256 MB of RAM (for a total of 512 MB) and the larger, faster hard drive (80GB @ 5400 rpm). I just couldn't imagine 256 MB of RAM being adequate for my needs, and everyone says the 5400 rpm HD is so much faster than 4200 rpm, so that and an addional 20 GB of space made it a no brainer. Anyway, this is my first Mac. I'm in art school and that's all we use there, and it's all the industry uses, not to mention that Apple gave me an enormous credit line when all I wanted to do was buy an iPod.   This is a great machine. Everything about it is so elegant. A friend of mine has a Gateway laptop, and I find it offensive by comparison. Not only is it big and ugly and plastic with ports on every side of it, but it has horrible ergonomics (a weird keyboard with narrower keys that are not the standard size and a horrible set of mouse buttons) and a typical but still cheesy optical drive that you have to slide out and then snap the disc onto the spindle. I guess what this says is that I've become a Mac snob, but the PowerBook is just so beautiful and so much more thoughtfully designed, all the ports are on the left side, and there are no legacy ports that no uses anymore any way, and on the right is the snappy slot-loading SuperDrive, for which I can not even describe the satisfaction you get when you put in a disc and it sucks it out of your fingers, giving a soft mechanical sound afterward as it mounts it. Also great is the latch, it's magnetic so that the clasp only manifests when it's near the other half of the laptop when you go to close it, when you open it, it retracts back into its slot, so there is no little metal thing sticking out the top of the display. I have had no problems with it, and I'd also like to note that I have no problem with the keys dirtying or scuffing the display, when the PowerBook is closed there is no contact between the two, it looks like Apple increased the amount of space between the two, because I know in the past a lot of people have complained about this happening. None of this is to mention the Mac OS, but this isn't a review of that, although I will say that while both Mac OS and Windows have their strengths and weaknesses, the Mac OS does have a curious way of some how making you feel more engaged with whatever it is you are doing, and just feels and looks a lot nicer to boot.   There are a few things I don't like about the PowerBook. One is the speakers, although that is minor. They sound as good as you can expect them too, but the volume doesn't go as loud as you would expect. Second is that this thing can get very hot. If you just have it on your lap for awhile expect it to get uncomfortably warm eventually. If the PowerBook is very well ventilated I noticed heat doesn't become a problem, but if you are hanging out in bed or on the couch without some sort of table or something, and it's actually on the bed or even your lap, it can get pretty hot. I never really use this thing at a desk, because I can't stand sitting at one and that's why I wanted a notebook to begin with. I guess there isn't much Apple can do about it, maybe use faster fans or something, but as they are the fans are pretty quiet, where as, to bring up the Gateway, the fans on that thing are really intrusively loud, although it does stay a lot cooler.   Everything else is great. I love that it is cased in aluminum. It feels and looks great, and when you tell people it's aluminum they are always impressed. The battery lasts a good while and, if you flip the PowerBook over there is a little button you can press that will cause a row of LCDs next to it to light up and reveal the remaining charge. These lights also blink to indicate the charge status while the PowerBook is charging. There are great features to use when the 'Book is closed and you don't want to open it and wake it just to check the battery status. Also nice is how the plug itself, where it plugs into the machine, has a led that glows orange if it is charging and green if the the battery is full.   Anyway, the keyboard has full sized keys, and after you get used to the inherently different dynamics of a laptop keyboard, it feels very nice. Unfortunately there is no option for the backlit keyboard like there is on the larger models. The trackpad is a trackpad, it's certainly a lot better than my friend's horrible Gateway one, which is actually smaller than the PowerBook's but is paired to a 15 inch screen (figure that one out!). On the whole the computer is really quite fast and responsive and just a pleasure to use with ZERO frustrating wait time for something small and stupid to respond or occur, which is so nice because i have ZERO patience, and the included Airport Extreme card is nice and saved me the expense of buying one separately. The reception seems pretty good, I was sitting in a park across the street from a hotel and had two bars showing, and was able to surf comfortably for an hour before I decided to leave. I can't comment on the Bluetooth as I don't own any Bluetooth devices yet.   The SuperDrive seems fast, although I haven't really burned much with it yet, mostly CD-RW back ups and a small backup to a DVD which didn't take as long as I thought it might if that counts for anything. I copied a couple music CDs and that went extremely quickly.   As for the screen, well, particularly if you put it side by side with the larger models it will seem small. But once I started using it, within 10 minutes I adapted completely to the size and it seems perfect now. Although I am an art student and do use a lot of graphic applications, the screen is adequate for me. Sometimes a higher resolution would be nice (it goes to 1024x768 max) but all that is really required is a little extra scrolling and zooming in and out in things like Photoshop than I am used to, and I have met people with 17 inchers who can't stand the size and weight when it comes time to take it with them somewhere, and I never have that problem because it's so small it fits in every bag perfectly and is very easy on the shoulders to carry. As for color and contrast they are of course great, it can wash out in the outdoors depending on the intensity of the sunlight, but any sort of color LCD will have that problem. If you are using it in even moderate shade you should be able to so comfortably, but If it's bright, direct sunlight though, forget it.   All in all I highly recommend this machine, it's such a joy in every way.
A very solid product.  I just received this computer a few hours ago.  Installation and personalization were incredibly easy to accomplish.  I was expecting trouble because of the new operating system (Windows 8.1) and my own lack of experience with this hardware manufacturer.  The actual setup process was incredibly smooth.  I bought this computer specifically to drive my new 3d printer.  I had trouble connecting the printer to my big Windows 7 desktop and decided to try a new and up to date system to dedicate to this process.  This computer turned out to be an excellent choice.  After only an hour or two I had the initial customization complete, installed the 3d printer interface software with no hitches and had the printer dancing to the tune of the new computer.  (I love it when a plan comes together!)
excelente
Decent mid range laptop for multiple activities  Good mid range laptop it can play most games at high to mid range quality and gives a pleasant experience. The speakers are also fairly loud.
High Performance Laptop  Great laptop for the price.  Gave to my daughter for her birthday.  She loves it and likes Windows 8 for the device interfaces
I love it!  It's a beauty... works like a charm..it booted up in seconds and synced my data right away. I couldn't be happier with it. This is my second Chromebook by the way.
