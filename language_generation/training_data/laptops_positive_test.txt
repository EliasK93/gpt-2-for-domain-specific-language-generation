Purchased this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it thanks
This laptop gets hot but theres an easy fix. "Update" important update for bios!  I purchased a slightly different version of this laptop off of best buy the only difference with there being no ssd (and the screen being a tn panel). I love experimenting with technology so the first thing I did after updating this laptop was download cpuz. I immediately noticed that while playing ds3 that my cpu temps were rising straight to 80-90c range, I was not happy at all to see those temps especially while using a cooling pad!  Solution: Open Power Options either by clicking the icon in the All Control Panel Options menu or by double-clicking the Windows battery icon in your system tray. Select Change plan settings next to the power plan you are using (balanced, power saver, etc). Select Change advanced power settings And change the max cpu power output to 85 instead of 100. After several tests my cpu now stays well withen the range of 65-70c and the same for gpu which is very solid for a laptop. Dont think of this as a loss in fps cause after testing I actually gained fps because my cpu no longer throttles due to high temps.  Its safe to say this cpu way more then out matches this gpu and by lowering its max power output you really aren't restraining anything other then perhaps certain times while playing and having too much going on in game like perhaps starcraft and even then you should be well in the range of 60 fps with this beast. Also I noticed the screen was a little to bright for my eyes and lowered it down to less then 50% with it still being a little too bright and noticed another 2c drop in temp hope this helps!:)  Update:  read into BIOS update 300 which doesn't appear to come stock maxes out fan speed at around 75c keeping temps much cooler. Using it myself with max power enabled, this tip is helpful if you you refuse to to avoid lowering performance at all costs. I'd post a link to the update but can't seem to post links here.   [...]
excelente.
Great specification.  Great specification.
Laptop arrived in excellent shape ,so I got started right up with no problems. Boot time is fine; no annoying fan buzzes or humming noises; the battery holds a good charge; power cord is in good shape with no fraying; malware and spyware scans found no issues; all four USB ports work fine; I'm fully satisfied.
This is hands-down the best laptop I've ever had  This is hands-down the best laptop I've ever had, and I've had a bunch. This thing is fast and the battery is lasting upwards of 9 to 11 hours, depending on what I'm doing. It's so thin & light it feels like I'm carrying a tablet around...absolutely love it. I'm a software developer, and I love to max out the RAM and SSD on machines, so at first I was a bit apprehensive when I realized I could only get 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB HDD, but then again, it's not my main machine. I'm not storing movies and music on here, so there's plenty of room. I've got Windows 10 Pro on it now, and couldn't be happier. I rarely use the touch screen though, because I'm so used to the track-pad, which is also very good. As soon as I realized I could tap once with 2 fingers simultaneously to simulate a right-click, I don't even click the track-pad hard anymore, I'm just barely touching it. The back-lit keyboard is amazing too when I'm sitting in bed and don't want to disturb my wife. There are two brightness levels. Oh, and I am flying on this keyboard. I'm just as fast as I am on a regular PC keyboard. I did my research, almost bought a Mac, and decided on this. No regrets here. I'm in thin light laptop heaven.
very very nice..... amazon made this a pleasant purchase. thin and very light. great features and price.
Amazing  Amazing product for the money. Definitely worth every penny.
Muy bueno
Double Dex is the best  Best MacBook ever. I bought 2 macbooks. They look and work like new only thing is they are much cheaper which is a good thing. Double dex is a great MacBook place they are the best.
Always a winner  Since 2003, I have always purchased Dell products & I haven't been burned yet.  They last forever with very little maintenance.
Chromebook works great--just what I needed !!
great chromebook  I love chromebooks and I am using my new toshiba chromebook 2 to type this review. It is a perfect size and looks very stylish. Also super fast and can do everything I need
Excellent!
i hate it
Love this brand  Gorgeous laptop. I have no had it for over a year with no issues. My old Asus is still ticking after 7 years and my daughter now uses it. Love this brand.
How did I compute without it?  I have been a diehard Windows user since the 3.1 days and never imagined in my wildest dreams I would ever own a Mac computer.  Well, after seeing them firsthand when I used to work for CompUSA, I finally decided it was time to switch.  I am SO glad I did!  I had the IBook out of the box and online in 15 minutes!  It took Windows that long to boot up and start the configurator!  OS X is very easy to navigate around that, aside from a few growing pains, I have been able to navigate like a pro.  I do miss the scroll button on my mouse, though I can live without that.  I love the sleep mode!!!  When I first heard of it, I had my doubts knowing how it never worked on Windows machines, but after having my IBook almost a week, I haven't had the need to shut it fully off yet.  I close the lid and come right back where I was!  I know some people take this as a canned motto, but it just works!  I tell it to do something and it does it!  That's exactly what I expect out of my computer!  Battery life is excellent and the built in Airport Extreme is faster I think that hardwired broadband internet.  Purchase this notebook and you will not be disappointed!
Steal of a Deal  If you are very handy with laptops and software upgrades then this is the computer for you.  Complete the system restore back ups immediately (4hrs. and 3 DVDs).  Go to the U.S. Acer website and flash the BIOS 1.31 as of Feb. 2010.  Update the drivers for LAN, WIFI, and Chipset.  Be sure to select the correct operating system. Also there is one "Application" on the Acer website called Optical Drive Power Management. This can correct the problem of not recognizing the DVD drive.  I had an existing upgrade to Windows 7 64 bit Home Premium and installed it with no problems. Remove the bloatware and McAfee.  Use AVG and Google Chrome and it will run fast enough. I can play 720p high definition videos with no latency with the right codec.  Benefits: 1. Well constructed gun metal aluminum (light) 2. IMHO the surround sound speakers are excellent, rich, detailed but not powerful 3. Battery life with heavy usage 6+ hours on balanced power setting 4. Boots with 1 minute on Windows 7 64 bit 5. Multi task with Office 2007 and with multiple web browser tabs open 6. Touchpad is excellent especially for schooling if you like touchpads 7. Widescreen HD looks terrific - no dead pixels 8. Runs extremely cool.  Drawbacks: This is not Plug & Play and requires some tech sweat equity. Single Core & Vista operating system. Overall: This is a fabulous notebook for the money. $399 during a refurbished sale.
Love it!  This computer is extremely fast and does exactly what I need it to for school. Only downsides are you cannot print from it unless you email it to yourself and print from another computer, no disk drive, and couldn't get a memory stick to read on it. Other than that it does great. Never knew anything at all about a chromebook until I made this purchase but now I know. Works for school and internet browsing great
My coworkers have come to love these little ultrabooks! With the SSD and 8GB of RAM  My coworkers have come to love these little ultrabooks! With the SSD and 8GB of RAM, they're much faster than some of the new units we were getting from Dell for 3x the price. Also helps that these are still using the older E-Series docking stations since we're hesitant to move the office over to the new USB-C docking stations. Only a matter of time before we're forced into that though!
Great value!
The Best!  Defnitely the best laptop you can buy. It's almost perfect and hats saying a lot considering how great their products are already. They just keep getting better and better, but this machine is so great it will last me a long time before another upgrade. Bravo!
Really great for the price.  I really love my chromebook and it does everything I want it to do. What I really love is the battery life because it takes 30 minutes to fully charge and the battery lasts for 10 hours. I bought it back when it was 300.
Perfect Machine; Perfect Service  Great machine, easily able to be upgraded to Windows 7.  The gentlemen at JSW were extremely helpful.  When I received this product, the DVD player/burner was not working (it happens when you are shipping sensitive electronic equipment).  But one email later, and after a small review of what the issue was...they replaced the DVD player/burner with no further delay or questions.  The DVD player/burner for this model is easily removable with the touch of a button, it pulls right out and the new one they sent me plugged right in and worked perfectly.
Pretty Neat Little Laptop  I think most of the reviews below are accurate but I'd like to add some points -  1) The keyboard is really very good.  The keys are a nice size given the overall size of this device. 2) Make sure and use the Microsoft IE 11 browser in Metro mode when you can.  It's really an incredible browser that allows you to take full advantage of the touch screen.  If you designate any other browser as the default browser, you lose access to the metro version of IE.  My advice - let IE be the default browser.  You can still use other browsers, they just won't be the default. 3) Understand that if you run this machine with lots of windows open and programs running, it will slow it down considerably.  You can do it but with only 2gb of ram and the nature of this processor, don't expect it to act like a full fledged laptop. 4) The screen bents to the point that the laptop is almost flat.  This is a really nice touch since it makes it easier to use the machine on things like exercise equipment. 5) I've found the touchpad to be pretty darn good.  And while you lose some space with the left and right mouse clickers, they two have a nice feel to them. 6) The power cord is good and long and there is no "brick" in the middle of the cord.  Just a fairly small converter at the point where you plug it in. 7) I've been getting good wifi reception.  And since I take it with me to the gym where it can be a challenge sometimes to get good wifi, I have to say I'm impressed. 8) If you are going to go with a smaller device that only has a 3 cell battery, you need a processor that is truly an energy miser otherwise you are looking at 2 hours of battery life  The intel processor in this machine is rated at 4.3 watts.  It really helps on battery life.  So what isn't good.  Actually there isn't much to complain about.  You do have to get used to the slower processor.  It's speedy by tablet standards but not so much compared to larger laptops.  Netflix and Youtube do just fine.  Okay, this review wouldn't be complete without a comment about Windows 8/8.1.  People who don't like it, don't seem to understand it.  That is understandable since Microsoft launched it with virtually no touch screen computers.  Get to know the features behind Windows 8 with or without the touch screen.  There is a lot good here...including the apps that are starting to get developed for the OS.  I have several that I use everyday and really enjoy.  Consider loading the free program Classic Shell if you want the full start button effect.  I have done it on every Windows 8 machine I've had  It allows you easy access to your legacy Windows programs as well as your Win8 apps.  The overall build on this machine is nice and coupled with Windows 8 makes it a winner.  I've been pleasantly surprised.
It is awesome
Great Laptop!  I am very impressed with this laptop. I needed something quickly because my old Dell laptop wasn't functioning well. This arrived to me sooner than expected and seller was very good about responding to some initial questions that I had. Overall, I am loving this new laptop! It's brand new and much improved from my older version. I love the look and functionality of it. The screen is nice and big for easier viewing, yet not too big. Laptop is fairly light given it's size. Haven't tested all the functionality yet since I just received it not too long ago, but so far it's great!
so i love my chrome book it was a little funky at first cause i wasn't familiar with this keyboard set up but now like i said i love it its starts up so fast without all the extra stuff my pc needs load i can just turn it on and hop straight on the internet totally glad i got this
Third Dell 6X0 I purchased form the vendor. the D630 is a very rugged. Had to buy a PCCard adapter to use the SD card.
Great little laptop for park guides in Rwanda  Good value for a laptop. We donate these to national park guides in Rwanda so they can go to college with the appropriate tools.
Very useful
shipment to india  This laptop is absolutely outstanding but I want seller's contact info to know more about payment and shipment
++++AAAAA
My Apple Macbook Pro  So far so well, or I guess i should say I Love It!!! This is my first Mac and I will have one from now on. Thank you Amazon for all your support and value.
Rock Solid Laptop  Pros: 1) Fast boot 2) Powerful graphics 3) Whisper quiet 4) Stays cool 5) Rock solid and dependable performance. 6) Upgrade accessibility is very good (easily and quickly converted 1 gig to 1 gig SSD) how to videos easily found on YouTube.  Cons: 1) The pre-installed Game First III software was causing me major connectivity issues playing GTA V Online, which plays beautifully on this laptop since uninstalling it.  (very high and ultra graphics easily achieved BTW) 2) My only beefs are the extra buttons, they are located right above the ESC key, just a personal peave, i like my ESC key to be the corner.  Now i risk launching the video streaming just due to habit, would have been better off centered. 3) Can't say I've used the steam button at all since I usually have it running on my taskbar and the full screen default is just way to big, i feel like I have to stand back to view it. 4) The ROG key is barely used as well, the application isn't all that expansive to warrant a dedicated button. 5) The red backlit panel is ok, but having a brighter color option or even color coding would have been a nice perk.  Overall i think the pros outweigh the cons, the pros are the important factors.  The only major issue was the game first III software, it really had me checking everything possible for my connectivity issues.  Been working flawlessly after removing it though.  Overall highly recommended.
Good quality MacBooks  Bought a used one, works just like a new one.
Great, but be weary  Most of what the other positive reviews say is correct.  There are a few cautions one needs to take though. Amazon's stock seems to have a large fail rate. The first one I bought had a corrupted recovery partition, so I got it exchanged. The second one had a scratch on the screen. The third and fourth had dead pixels. The fifth one seems to have no problem. I would strongly recommend buying this laptop, but you ought to buy it from a physical store, as exchanging defective ones would be a lot easier.  All in all, it seems to be a great laptop, it is just going to take a while to embrace it given the past experiences.
My wife received it a few days days ago. She definitely loves it. It it solid with a slim design and suitable for ladies. She use it for entertainment, watching movies, playing online games, and browsing internet, always runs fast. It is worth the money you paid.
Great laptop. Runs super cool and you can't hear it all. 5/5 great deal for the price.
HP ENVY 15t Quad was worth the buy  Beautifully slim and response fast.  Really getting use to the 8.1 OS and beginning to like the functionality.  For the price much better than buying a comparable Apple.
Everything i needed
Runs fast and touchscreen is a nice touch! Thanks!
Can't ask for a more powerful computer for the money.  This is an absolutely fantastic machine. Rather than talking about the good points, however, I find it more useful to talk about what I don't like about it, even though I've given it 5 stars and would highly recommend it to anybody looking for a powerful machine at an affordable price.  I've only come across only a few issues with it thus far. Right out of the box, the track pad is trash. The mouse button in part of the track pad so it is almost impossible to click something without moving the pointer. Anyways, I found out that it isn't the trackpad, it's the driver. To fix this, I just uninstalled the current driver, installed the one from Synaptics, and set a "deadzone" on the mouse so the button is not considered part of the track pad. The new driver also gives the user better control so you can really tinker with the settings. Now, the trackpack is fantastic.   Another issue is that it runs pretty hot when playing games or movies. This isn't that intolerable, but if you live in a hot climate and plan on having it on your lap, I'd recommend a cooling pad.  Third, it is bulky as hell. I have a Targus bag for a 15.6" laptop and it's a squeeze to get this laptop in the bag. When you do get it in there, it's heavy as hell and really wears on your shoulder after awhile. The power block is literally the size of a brick, and pretty heavy also. If you're looking for portability, then this is not the laptop for you. Lucky for me, I don't plan on lugging it around with me too much so the size is something I was completely expecting with the amount of hardware inside of this machine.  Finally, the battery life is subpar. I found that you can increase it by shutting off the SLI and lowering the screen brightness, but even then you are only looking at less than 3.5 hours. This means you have to lug that power brick around with you if you are going to be using it away from home. It also means that you're gonna be screwed if you don't have an outlet nearby. If you're really hard up, you can purchase a 9-cell battery for it, which supposedly increases the life to ~4.5-5 hours.
It looks nice keyboard feels nice  It's an alright laptop. It looks nice keyboard feels nice, and I just use it to write down notes, and does what I want it to do. SURPRISINGLY it can run League of Legends at a good 40-50 frames with everything on low. SO that was p cool.
Small Wonder  After waiting for a third revision of the 12 inch PowerBook, I decided to get one. I decided on the 12 inch because of the very portable size and the lower price. In addition to the standard features I opted for 256 MB of RAM (for a total of 512 MB) and the larger, faster hard drive (80GB @ 5400 rpm). I just couldn't imagine 256 MB of RAM being adequate for my needs, and everyone says the 5400 rpm HD is so much faster than 4200 rpm, so that and an addional 20 GB of space made it a no brainer. Anyway, this is my first Mac. I'm in art school and that's all we use there, and it's all the industry uses, not to mention that Apple gave me an enormous credit line when all I wanted to do was buy an iPod.   This is a great machine. Everything about it is so elegant. A friend of mine has a Gateway laptop, and I find it offensive by comparison. Not only is it big and ugly and plastic with ports on every side of it, but it has horrible ergonomics (a weird keyboard with narrower keys that are not the standard size and a horrible set of mouse buttons) and a typical but still cheesy optical drive that you have to slide out and then snap the disc onto the spindle. I guess what this says is that I've become a Mac snob, but the PowerBook is just so beautiful and so much more thoughtfully designed, all the ports are on the left side, and there are no legacy ports that no uses anymore any way, and on the right is the snappy slot-loading SuperDrive, for which I can not even describe the satisfaction you get when you put in a disc and it sucks it out of your fingers, giving a soft mechanical sound afterward as it mounts it. Also great is the latch, it's magnetic so that the clasp only manifests when it's near the other half of the laptop when you go to close it, when you open it, it retracts back into its slot, so there is no little metal thing sticking out the top of the display. I have had no problems with it, and I'd also like to note that I have no problem with the keys dirtying or scuffing the display, when the PowerBook is closed there is no contact between the two, it looks like Apple increased the amount of space between the two, because I know in the past a lot of people have complained about this happening. None of this is to mention the Mac OS, but this isn't a review of that, although I will say that while both Mac OS and Windows have their strengths and weaknesses, the Mac OS does have a curious way of some how making you feel more engaged with whatever it is you are doing, and just feels and looks a lot nicer to boot.   There are a few things I don't like about the PowerBook. One is the speakers, although that is minor. They sound as good as you can expect them too, but the volume doesn't go as loud as you would expect. Second is that this thing can get very hot. If you just have it on your lap for awhile expect it to get uncomfortably warm eventually. If the PowerBook is very well ventilated I noticed heat doesn't become a problem, but if you are hanging out in bed or on the couch without some sort of table or something, and it's actually on the bed or even your lap, it can get pretty hot. I never really use this thing at a desk, because I can't stand sitting at one and that's why I wanted a notebook to begin with. I guess there isn't much Apple can do about it, maybe use faster fans or something, but as they are the fans are pretty quiet, where as, to bring up the Gateway, the fans on that thing are really intrusively loud, although it does stay a lot cooler.   Everything else is great. I love that it is cased in aluminum. It feels and looks great, and when you tell people it's aluminum they are always impressed. The battery lasts a good while and, if you flip the PowerBook over there is a little button you can press that will cause a row of LCDs next to it to light up and reveal the remaining charge. These lights also blink to indicate the charge status while the PowerBook is charging. There are great features to use when the 'Book is closed and you don't want to open it and wake it just to check the battery status. Also nice is how the plug itself, where it plugs into the machine, has a led that glows orange if it is charging and green if the the battery is full.   Anyway, the keyboard has full sized keys, and after you get used to the inherently different dynamics of a laptop keyboard, it feels very nice. Unfortunately there is no option for the backlit keyboard like there is on the larger models. The trackpad is a trackpad, it's certainly a lot better than my friend's horrible Gateway one, which is actually smaller than the PowerBook's but is paired to a 15 inch screen (figure that one out!). On the whole the computer is really quite fast and responsive and just a pleasure to use with ZERO frustrating wait time for something small and stupid to respond or occur, which is so nice because i have ZERO patience, and the included Airport Extreme card is nice and saved me the expense of buying one separately. The reception seems pretty good, I was sitting in a park across the street from a hotel and had two bars showing, and was able to surf comfortably for an hour before I decided to leave. I can't comment on the Bluetooth as I don't own any Bluetooth devices yet.   The SuperDrive seems fast, although I haven't really burned much with it yet, mostly CD-RW back ups and a small backup to a DVD which didn't take as long as I thought it might if that counts for anything. I copied a couple music CDs and that went extremely quickly.   As for the screen, well, particularly if you put it side by side with the larger models it will seem small. But once I started using it, within 10 minutes I adapted completely to the size and it seems perfect now. Although I am an art student and do use a lot of graphic applications, the screen is adequate for me. Sometimes a higher resolution would be nice (it goes to 1024x768 max) but all that is really required is a little extra scrolling and zooming in and out in things like Photoshop than I am used to, and I have met people with 17 inchers who can't stand the size and weight when it comes time to take it with them somewhere, and I never have that problem because it's so small it fits in every bag perfectly and is very easy on the shoulders to carry. As for color and contrast they are of course great, it can wash out in the outdoors depending on the intensity of the sunlight, but any sort of color LCD will have that problem. If you are using it in even moderate shade you should be able to so comfortably, but If it's bright, direct sunlight though, forget it.   All in all I highly recommend this machine, it's such a joy in every way.
A very solid product.  I just received this computer a few hours ago.  Installation and personalization were incredibly easy to accomplish.  I was expecting trouble because of the new operating system (Windows 8.1) and my own lack of experience with this hardware manufacturer.  The actual setup process was incredibly smooth.  I bought this computer specifically to drive my new 3d printer.  I had trouble connecting the printer to my big Windows 7 desktop and decided to try a new and up to date system to dedicate to this process.  This computer turned out to be an excellent choice.  After only an hour or two I had the initial customization complete, installed the 3d printer interface software with no hitches and had the printer dancing to the tune of the new computer.  (I love it when a plan comes together!)
excelente
Decent mid range laptop for multiple activities  Good mid range laptop it can play most games at high to mid range quality and gives a pleasant experience. The speakers are also fairly loud.
High Performance Laptop  Great laptop for the price.  Gave to my daughter for her birthday.  She loves it and likes Windows 8 for the device interfaces
I love it!  It's a beauty... works like a charm..it booted up in seconds and synced my data right away. I couldn't be happier with it. This is my second Chromebook by the way.
It was as nice as they said and has worked great for the last 2 years.
Working fine  I've had this machine since May 2016, it's working fine!
Is an amazing pc.  Is an amazing pc .... like an all around and everyday use laptop. I could super recommend it. It has a nice metal finish.
Great Laptop for the Price  You can't beat this laptop in terms of price - for the price you won't get a better deal on the market.  It has everything you could ask for, yes maybe it could have more video RAM but it's adequate.  The only thing I wish it had was the intellipoint mouse which I prefer over the touchpad one.  But other than that fabulous laptop and a great price.
like the plastit  very very quadro powerfull. like the plastit, the screen, the red light on keyboard. userfriendly. never had such a machine recommend to everyone the best. video performance super. using for photo editing
As advertised
GREAT LAPTOP  This laptop is PERFECT and for the price its a landslide!!!! I have read other reviews, not sure why your keyboard's backspace is there, mine is in the correct position. Mousepad is perfect, everything works extra smooth, laptop is like-silent, does not run very hot :)  Very happy I found this laptop, very cheap for the specs, much much much better than expected overall ...  For this laptop too, I run programs and do as much as it can, making it run the max it can, 24/7, does perfect job. Everything runs smoothly even running almost to max.  Very Very Very Extremely happy with this laptop and I highly highly extremely recommend it.  ----After a month or more of having this laptop, still working perfectly, with it being on almost 24/7, being used almost as much as it possibly can(Almost 100% CPU and 100% RAM, would never let it rest at 100% ...)all of the time because of me and my companies business.  Doing perfect so far.  Iv read other complaints about laggy cursor, the only time that ever happens is if your running your processor at the max it can be at, which you shouldnt anyways.
Outstanding Chromebook  I broke the power connector on my previous Chromebook by tripping over the power cord -- my fault.  Anyway, I have always been a fan of ASUS; I own many other ASUS products and as expected, this one is awesome.
Quick delivery  My granddaughter loves it. Great features
Exactly what I was looking for and at a great price.
Touch-Screen 15.6 HP from BestBuy  I bought my laptop from Best Buy, and I haven't come across a problem yet. I bought mine on the fourth and it's working tremendously. The bundle I bought was $490 all together. That price included a bag, spray for the touch screen 6-month free internet security, and a USB.
The machine is too expensive, considering that it's last year's processor.  I got just what I needed in this machine.  I wanted a small but high-resolution screen, multi-touch, a wacom stylus, a decent keyboard, more powerful processor than an Atom, big enough SSD for my needs, and reasonable battery life. It delivers on all those points. The detaching tablet is the best part of it all for me! I can work on a very powerful laptop if I need that power but can also play Fruit Ninja or Angry Birds on it's tablet mode with a touch screen! On my down time of course :)  I have had this machine for almost a month now. I waited to review it because I wanted the opportunity to really experience it's full capacity.  I am glad I purchased this, though a bit disappointed that it did not come with a Haswell processor, but then again I was already aware of it. I just can not understand why Lenovo would not upgrade to Haswell, being that the processor has been out for a while now. Come ON, Lenovo GET with the program! The fan runs most of the time when in Laptop mode. It's a relatively quiet fan, but again if they had updated this machine to Haswell by now, maybe it could run without the fan when not doing extensive work. I suppose I could HAVE waited for the Haswell version, but I needed a new laptop NOW so when I saw this one come down in price from like $1,400, I jumped on it, but like the title of my review says, I still feel that this machine is too expensive, considering that it's last year's processor.  Over all, I am both happy and satisfied with this purchase. This machine feels very solid to me, not like others I have played with and are wobbly or plasticky looking and just feel like it's gonna break in your hands. Heck, even the keyboard feels really nice! Not like the Surface that feels like you're tapping on a piece of cardboard :) My final words: If you can afford it, and you want something solid GO for it.
Bought it for my son and it was totally worth the value. Thank you
I am so pleased with my new computer!
13" MacBook Pro retina  Upgraded from MacBook Air. Couldn't believe how faster this is! Had a big problem placing my order due to time constraints ,but Shelli with customer service did a fantastic job! She not only solved the order problems,she personally made sure I received it sooned than I had hoped for! Many Kudos to Shelli!
MacBook  I love this MacBook. It was easy to setup & connect my printer to. This is the first MacBook I have ever purchased,  I wish I had purchased sooner.
Good laptop  Very good battery life. Great price for a nice laptop. This will serve well for those who needs a dedicated internet laptop without the clutter of windows. Super fast booting and shutdown. Only took a couple of minutes to setup.
Better than a Surface Pro 3  Best affordable tablet/laptop available! It has everything you need for a computer. For the price, it is way better than a Surface Pro 3. Lightweight, sturdy keyboard/hard drive, and smaller size for travel. I shopped around for months trying to find a computer with apps (smartphone/tablet apps), detachable or movable keyboard to turn it into a tablet, and able to run any software I want (i.e. iTunes). No laptop is able to run the same apps as your smartphone or regular tablet. Windows 8 is great. You do not have to pay extra for Microsoft office! The regular ASUS Transformer Book T100 does not include a 500 GB hard drive built into the keyboard. This one has a hard drive built right into the keyboard, so you do not need to carry an external hard drive to use your software. 32 GB is plenty for the tablet part. This is the smartest purchase for a computer I have ever made.
Better than expected  So far so good, ive been testing it for a few days and runs everything smoothly, nice temps, its also quiet.... im able to play borderlands 2 at 720p everything maxed out at 40-60 fps, i haven't tested BF3 yet but i figured it shouldnt have any problems, in conclusion the 640m is a very capable gpu backed up by an incredible  ivy i5 processor the build quality seems quite solid, usb 3.0 ports are pretty much appreciated.. on another hand the screen doesnt have a good view angle so it could be a pain if you don't watch it right in front  bottom line, very good laptop for the price, if you don't need a huge gaming laptop but still want to play some decent games get this one!
great size. fast. good value. recommend it for students
My 80 year old mom loves this.  I bought this for my 80 year old mother when the desktop I had given her several years ago died.  She wanted something she could use sitting at the kitchen table or sitting on the couch.  I was worried there would be a learning curve for her to get used to the smaller screen and just using this but there was not at all. She took right to it although we did have to go over the logon and log off several times. Due to it being a Chromebook you have to sign in and sign out of google...just cant power off.  It was super easy to get set up for her and she really enjoys it. She only uses it to check her email , facebook and to order from Peapod so this works just perfect and at a very good price.
Great computer works like a charm!
works like a charm..i love it
love the size & looks of it  Just got it yesterday..know nothing about Windows 8 but hopin to  learn..love the size & looks of it..its all I  know so far...
Very satisfied!  I absolutely love it!
laptop  fast shipment, great product, was supposed to be 80 gigs hard drive but only 55 gigs, but other than that, it is great
Happy with my laptop :D  I'm very happy with this laptop so far.  I have had it for about a month now and so far all is well.  I love the backlit keyboard which makes typing so much easier in low light.  I can play some of my games on this as well as do my work.  It is very nice.  So far no issues.
I love it =)  Fantastic laptop!
This is an outstanding computer, actually I bought it for my wife and she really enjoys it. The first laptop we've owned and it's a good one. I will recommend it to my friends and family.
Easy to navigate
Wow  This laptop is amazing. The first thing I did was purchase an additional HD bracked from here: http://www.notebooksolutions.ca/zc/acer-original-bracket-ac53371-51589.html  This allowed me to put my SSD in without it rattling around. The next thing I did was nuke all windows partitions and install Ubuntu. Once I did that, it was a cracking laptop.
good computer  good computer
Very nice, portable and multifunctional but I am surprised it did not come with a stylus. Also, I thought the keyboard could light up in the background but this one doesn't. Am I missing something?
Designer/Gamer- After you work the qinks out....  After I cleared the bundle-ware, and updated drivers (be warned Nvidia drivers are not compatible with this model even when forcing them to work it has undesired results like screen flickering, hoping ASUS updates its modded drivers) after the card got overclocked everything looks great for games i got some clog points but I just think that's poor programming on the game developer end. The backlights work and if they don't; install the driver from the disk they give you. Some cases where u have no blue light and just back light or no backlight..this just means that the button is off and you turned the lights on manually, press left blue button then fn+f3 turns everything on. keystrokes skipping is when u accidentally hit the touch pad, and this hasn't happened to me yet. Maybe I'm just GOOD AT TYPING idk. As for cracky sound i did have this problem on arrival but it went away after all the windows updates and driver updates and when some of the creative bundle got unintsalled. Sound is magnificent for laptop speakers, and even better with headphones in. Things I like-  * Great viewing angles for this price range!* * Mat finish- easy to clean, no fingerprints, looks awesome closed, sometimes I feel it up... * Cooling- amazing never seen it go above 71C; this is a laptop that will last a long time * Had no blue screens- I had a freeze up that made me restart but it was cause I overclocked to high * Sound- <3 * Backlite keys and blue glow- <3 * Extra bay for another hard drive or SSDive/Also can upgrade ram- I heard theirs a hard to get to free open one too if you feeling spunky * Photoshop moves smooth with gigabite files- It almost made me cry seeing my 24 x 36 design presentation boards be edited without slow downs * Autocad/Revit/Autodesk anything- Works hardcore, rendering is faster not by too much but it is noticeable; 8 boxes instead of 2 thanks to the i7 processor (quicksilver rendering nice cause of gtx 460m) * The 677 starter memory is great for the price; great value - I feel almost unworthy of this laptop and the screen is beautiful, dl'd blue-ray quality videos, it may not have the blue-ray drive but it certinly can play them when they are on the computer *3.0 usb- <3 * Its nice to get top graphics on most video games and haphazardly putting everything on Ulra or Extreme feels nice..remember humans don't notice much difference in frames when its above about 32 fps  Things I disliked-  * Long annoying start up configuration - to get this beast working you have to know what your doing to get the most out of it otherwise with how it comes it will be sluggish, slow, and bundled. slightly dis appointing at unboxing with spoty back-lights, slow processing (always at 100%), cracky sound, and poor graphics. I recommend clean install of windows I didn't and it was very annoying but satisfying at completion. (if u clean install don't worry some of the needed drivers and bundleware is found on the CD it comes with where you can then choose what you want)  *crumbs get stuck around mouse pad cracks and clicking cracks  I researched this price range to death, notebookcheck.com is an amazing reference it sold me on this rather than the qosmio from toshiba. Not to mention this thing looks bad azz Hope this review helps people cause all the problems people point out about this beast, were essentially newb hits. BEST DESKTOP REPLACEMENT LAPTOP FOR THE PRICE. gameover
This computer is absolutely worth the money.  Thank you for taking the time to read these few statements. I am so glad I bought this machine.  First off it is built extremely well. The touch screen is very responsive as are the keyboard keys and touch pad. The touchpad gestures for scrolling work amazing. The beats audio subtle flare is a nice touch with the red trim around the keyboard, The speakers sound amazing and probably the best speakers I've ever heard on a laptop. The fingerprint scanner actually works really well and I can use it to sign into gmail, facebook, reddit, Pandora, etc. I even tested it being the skeptic I am, first with other fingers (it's set to my right pointer finger so you know which one to cut off to gain access) and then by having someone else put there fingers on there. No go! Only the one print on the one finger worked. The keyboard is a bit flexy when typing but I don't see this being a problem and I don't actually notice it at all when typing. This thing is actually pretty light and SUPER thin. It's definitely a very nice looking machine and it's been fun showing it off. WIndows 8 makes more sense with a touch screen and i'm getting used to it.  For you gamers like me, so far so good. I mainly play MMO type games and so far have tried league of legends, guild wars 2 and world of warcraft. All of which work without a hitch. With Nvidia experience it will even optimize your games graphics settings and automatically set it to run as good as possible. I've had no lag in any of the above games and with the processor being as fast as it is alt tabbing is super fast with games open. Load times seem very snappy and the graphics look clean and in high definition.  For you media junkies. This thing can process media just fine. I run photoshop CS6 which is a pretty cpu intensive program and it handles it without even showing any stress at all. It's been a  pleasure to work on this computer. I'd imagine video editing would be a breeze. It also runs my PCDJ program great and without any lag.  The funny thing is I've never bought a "name brand" computer before such as HP. I used to be a bit snobby when it came to pc's and only purchased pc's built in local computer shops by the wonderful nerds who's passion in life was computers (I know how that sounds, it's ridiculous but it's awesome). I moved to Alaska for work about 5 months ago and only was able to pack my clothes. I've been replacing my electronics from back home with new shiny ones and decided to give this computer a shot after reading the specs here on amazon. Honestly, I am absolutely floored with this thing and couldn't be happier. I decided not to make a pros/cons list because so far there really are no cons I can find. HP has really impressed me.
Very good
Great Value for the Purchase Price  Love this laptop. Fast, great design, and not heavy.
Love it#
This is working great so far.
excellent computer running very good and very looking
Great Laptop for a Great Price!  Great laptop at a great price!  The only downside is that the memory is so small that I have had to pick and choose what I download and remove some programs before adding others. (and no there is no way to add more on this unit)  For example, I wanted to add an additional wireless printer yesterday, but I had to find a bunch of files that could be deleted just to make room.  Ugh!!  On the plus side, the laptop is lightweight, versatile and is super fast.  It is a great home lap top if you are just using it mostly for Facebook, email and of course shopping on Amazon.  It also works well for printing coupons and since adding the Windows products, my daughters can easily write papers, etc.  I do recommend it for any one who doesn't need a lot of storage.
This is a beast!  I recommend this to anyone looking for just web browsing or online banking that is what I got it for. I haven't been able to put it down since it arrived.
Perfect computer for photography, or anything else for that matter.  I have always owned Windows OS computers, but after windows 8 was released I decided I needed to try something else.  Many of my coworkers use MAC products and love them, so I decided to consider a Mac.  I do a lot of photography so I wanted to make sure my laptop would be able to handle it.  My last laptop was a 17", and I was a little concerned if 15" would be big enough to edit photos, but after using the macbook with the retina display I can honestly say I prefer editing on the 15" Retina.  It took me a couple weeks and watching some Youtube tutorials to get used to the Mac, but after I figured it out I LOVE it!  I will never own anything else.  The Battery will last easily 9 hrs, and charges to 100% in less than 3 hrs.  The processor is lighting fast, I never saw the Loading umbrella until I had owned the computer at least a month.  The build quality is superb.  It was a decent chunk of change to drop on a computer, but I love everything about it.  I'll probably my my wife a macbook pro too.  I always thought people just had Mac products  because they are trendy, but I can understand the hype now that I have one.  Excellent product.
Fast, lightweight computer  I did a lot of research before buying this current computer. Months. I wasn't a computer expert before so I wanted to learn what the intel generations, SSD, and i5 were. I decided I wanted Haswell and only a few ultrabooks had 4th gen. Didn't want to buy an older version (3rd gen) and have the ultrabook be immediately outdated. The high price tag of this Acer initially put me off. However, Haswell is still new so it is understandable. I also seriously considered the sony vaio duo 13 and dell xps 12. The dell didn't have HDMI and I read the sony dropped wifi.  I originally thought I would not get the computer for 1-3 weeks (according to the amazon website). I was surprised when it came in two days (I have prime). Easy to open package, easy to set up.  Windows 8 takes some getting use to. I googled articles on using Windows 8 and some 'tips and tricks.' It takes a little personalizing to get full functionality. Learn the keyboard short cuts, edit the start page, download the Shell start button. Delete most of the bloatware. Useful shortcuts- Alt F4, Alt S, Ctrl R, Win D, Win N, Alt Tab  The computer is lightweight, just under 3lbs. Comes with a nice leather acer case (dark grey). Computer is very easy to take places; the charger is a little big. The computer holds at least 5 hrs charge. I use it everyday and I usually only charge it at night or every other day.  Sound is good. I've played a few netflix videos and I was satisfied with it. Screen also looks nice. Occasionally it auto corrects the brightness too low and I have to change it. It will keep running programs in the background unless you officially close them (Alt F4).  I have not had any problems with wifi. This was a big deal for me- most of the other ultrabooks I considered had badd reviews concerning wifi. I have not had any problems.  Screen collects fingerprints. They are only noticeable when its off. Quick boot time. It takes maybe 5 seconds to start from the lock screen. Maybe 15 sec when its fully powered off. Decent number of ports (a few USB, one HDMI, power, headphones, a few more I don't use).  When I first got it, it crashed a few times and the screen froze. Haven't had this issue in a while. For the first week I kept getting annoyed when a previous screen would randomly pop up. Turns out I was swiping the touch pad from the left (which causes the previous screen to pop up). I'm sure you can change this in the settings.  Touch screen is responsive. Occasionally I try to scroll down and it scrolls up (in firefox), but it's not a big issue. I am so use to the touch screen now, I tried to touch the screen of my 5 yr old Dell laptop (alas, it didn't work).  Download OneNote. It's amazing. Not related to this computer, but I just started using it and it's awesome. The touchscreen capabilities of the acer combined with OneNote are great. You can doodle right in your notes.  ------------  Overall, great computer. I need it for class and it's so light weight I can't wait to take it. Long battery life. High res screen, quality sound. My parents suddenly want one now.  If you want an entry level ultrabook, this is a great choice.
Please be smart with this  Please be smart with this. It WILL become unusable if you want to pretend it can run games like Minecraft. Other than that, consider this a Chromebook with the ability to get software on Windows XP
Very good, basic laptop.  This is a very good laptop for basic activity. It can play basic games and feels very sturdy. It streams videos very well and is overall a very nice laptop for the price.
Great little computer!  I purchased my Chromebook back in November, and while it is not a substitute for a traditional computer, I have found it invaluable and a great compliment to my desktop PC and smartphone. When I bought it, I imagined it as a computer I could use for travel and at work to replace my aging laptop. First, the battery life is wonderful. I don't even bother bringing the charger with me to work. The computer connects to the internet fast and easy, and initial setup was a breeze. Since I already had a Google account, everything synced right up - all my files, email, docs, blogs, ect was right there waiting for me. My next step was to set up some apps. These are not traditional apps as you would find on a phone or table, but more like links to a web page. Thats fine, and it really did not make a difference. Since I use Chrome on all my computers, everything again sync'd right up. This computer serves many purposes for me - web surfing checking email, and even watching movies and online content. It boots up fast and is ready to go in seconds.  Of course, there are drawbacks. First, it's not a traditional computer. So no programs, CD drives, Microsoft office or any of that stuff. Second, Flash support needs to improve; not every web page is 100% supported. And last, if you have a lot of tabs open, it slows down, but all computers would do that.  Who would best benefit from a Chromebook? Honestly, I think in someway everyone could. It's great for kids, students, travelers, bloggers, and business. I don't think it is suited for web content designers and graphic designers, but short of that I have found many uses for both work and play. For $249, how can you go wrong? I recently sold all my Apple stuff and made the move to Android for mobile (with a Samsung phone and Asus tablet) and a  Windows 8 touch PC. The Chromebook completes my transformation and compliments it well. I have not found the need to replace my laptop, and I enjoy the portability and quickness of the Chromebook. It's money well spent.
Terrifuc  Great office mobile computer
Great portable gaming monster.
Nice laptop. I got this laptop a week ago and love it! It works great for my use as a student. The windows 8.1 has taken a bit of getting used to but it doesn't bother me. The display is awesome and the touchscreen works great too! The processor is very fast, and the laptop makes virtually no noise at all--it doesn't even get hot!  If you are fond of gaming and Graphic intense work. Then leave this laptop as it has Intel HD 4400 Onboard Graphics and they aren't that good when it comes to gaming,for any other kind of work this laptop is a piece of cake.
I love this chromebook!  inexpensive, light weight, instant on.
Amazing Laptop.  I  recommend it 100 %. This laptop it's too fast and very cheap for the performance that has.! wonderful laptop.
excellent
MacBook has impressive performance.  ****UPDATE****  Eight months into this device and here are my thoughts: (if you want to see my original review it's at the bottom)  I recieved my 11.6 inch 1.6 GHz 4 GB RAM 128 GB flash storage MacBook Air in June of 2015, and from the unboxing I was more than satisfied.  My star rating doesn't change. The MacBook still has an extremely impressive performance based on the specs inside of it.  So far, I've had no performance problems. I can only remember ever having to restart the MacBook because of a problem once, in almost a year of having it, and it was just a small bug with QuickTime Player. It starts up fast, wakes up fast, and transfers files fast, mainly because of it's PCIe-based Flash Storage, (which is absolutely wonderful by the way). I only have 4 gigabytes of RAM and yet the machine is smooth and buttery. Even after the update to Mac OS X El Capitan, I barely noticed a change in performance. The only thing that I did notice after updating, was that it took longer to login to my account. Not that much of an issue though.  The MacBook loads pages fast, and is completely capable to do everything I need it to do. Which is about everything except for gaming. (Which is handles relatively nicely, surprisingly). I can actually run a couple of steam games on this device with a solid 60 FPS, (games like CS:GO), which is probably because of the decent graphics this device has. However, if you do try to run games that demand a lot of power from the CPU and GPU, the MacBook usually runs pretty hot. It's never overheated on me though.  I can edit videos on iMovie without a problem, or write a song on GarageBand without a problem as well. These are probably the two most bulky programs that are included with Mac OS X by default, and even those don't give my Mac a hard time.  The 720p FaceTime camera in the front is far more convenient than I thought it would be. One of the other models that Apple makes, the regular early 2015 MacBook, only has a 480p resolution FaceTime camera, so the MacBook air actually has a significantly better one. It's fun to mess around in photo booth with the camera, and actually to take good photos with as well.  The PCIe-based Flash Storage is a huge plus for this MacBook. I can transfer 1 terabyte of data from one location on my Mac to another in a matter of seconds, mind-blowing speeds for someone like me who's used to cheap slow-spinning hard drives. This storage also allows my Mac to start up in a matter of seconds too, and wake up in seconds as well.  The 1.6 GHz Intel Core i5 processor may not seem like a very powerful CPU, but I'm always amazed at how fast it actually is. It can also Turbo Boost up to 2.7 GHz, but if you do run a program that requires the CPU to do this, your computer will run pretty hot. I can't say much about it, because I've never really had the opportunity to push it to the limits, because everything I've done on my Mac has been handled flawlessly by this CPU.  The engineering behind this device is gorgeous. Apple paid attention to every little detail, and it integrates flawlessly with Mac OS X, which is something you don't really get with many PCs because the software and the hardware are made by two different companies. I can place the MacBook in the palm of my hand, and open the lid with little trouble. This is great, I hate having to pry open the lid of some laptops. The fans, and speakers are hidden in the device so everything looks seamless and pretty.  My one complaint about this device though, is a big one. The display is absolutely standard. It is a 1366x768 resolution display. Personally, I do not know of any 11.6 inch device that features a higher one. However, every other Apple MacBook features a 4k retina display, which is positively stunning. Once you see a 4k display in real life, it's difficult to go back to a standard HD one. With the new early 2015 model Apple MacBook, (not the one I'm reviewing), Apple managed to pack more than double the amount of pixels that are in my display into a display that is just 0.4 inches larger. The results are amazing, but like I said once you see that kind of display in real life it's hard to go back to a regular one. Just to clarify, there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with the display, it's just ordinary. And amongst a device where every other aspect is extraordinary, it is a little out of place.  But in conclusion, the MacBook is still amazing. Despite it having a single flaw, I would recommend it to anyone.  (Original review from day of unboxing)  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I just recieved my 11.6 inch 1.6 GHz 4 GB RAM 128 GB flash storage MacBook Air earlier today, and from the unboxing I was more than satisfied.  I wasn't QUITE what I was hoping for, I think mainly because of the MANY overly positive fanboy reviews that are also posted on this product, but it was still much more than satisfactory for the price.  I have always been a PC guy, until just recently because I desperately wanted a change. Based on how many people used the MacBook airs I thought it would be a good choice.  Originally, I was going to purchase the brand new 2015 MacBook that Apple just released, featuring a retina display as well as the new force touch trackpad, however I wasn't quite satisfied with a 1.1 GHz machine for over $1200. That model does however, include double the storage as my build as well as double the RAM, but for my uses most of this was overkill.  So far, I've had no troubles with this machine whatsoever, it setup smoothly, and it runs as smooth as butter regardless of its small amount of RAM. A lot of people say that you need 8 GB of RAM in order to fully experience Mac OS X Yosemite absolutely smoothly, but this is not true. As long as I don't have a million programs open my 4 GB build runs great.  There's a lot of power behind the 1.6 GHz, more than you would expect from a CPU clocked at that speed. I think Apple did a Stellar job of optimizing it with Yosemite as well as the rest of their engineering and integration into the knowledge board.  If I had to have ONE complaint, it would be the display. Don't get me wrong, I am more than satisfied with the display, the only thing is pretty much every apple laptop available includes a retina display. This display definitely wouldn't be a deal breaker for me, but it's definitely a good plus if you do decide to go with a more expensive model.  Some people complain about the lack of a force touch trackpad in the air model. However, it really doesn't bother me at all. The trackpad is great, really there's no advantages over the regular trackpad, except for a couple of integrations into Yosemite, (pressing harder on a fast forward button will make it fast forward faster), at least at this point, the old trackpad is absolutely fine for everything.  I don't have unlimited money, so I did purchase the base model. I would have liked the 13 inch model, but after having the 11.6 inch model for a little while I think I'd prefer the smaller one.  Overall, the Mac is great. No complaints. Completely satisfied.
awesome laptop, especially for the price  I see there's very detailed review on this laptop already, so I'll just say: it is nice, quality laptop. It feels very solid, not too heavy, the body material is great. It feels stylish. The keyboard is very smooth and easy to type. I don't do anything "heavy" on it, and I'm completely happy with this laptop.
this is great for a college student  A bit slow, but I was expecting that with Celeron. This will definitely do the job for college. If you're a gamer, stay away from this. All in all, this is great for a college student.
Good
No complaints, only praise; What a deal  After about 3 months with this laptop, I can safely safe it met my expectations. I'm going to write this review for those that are just casually looking right now, which I was not too long ago. I didn't know much about gaming PCs/laptops so hopefully some of this helps  Pros:   - The fact that it's a laptop; I will mention in the cons that it's not a "lap"top by any means, but it is mobile and attracted me for that reason (ex. I can go out on my back deck and play Dota/Farcry)   - The price is pretty ridiculously good. Comparing the specs with its competitors I might actually place this as the ultimate bargain.   - The specs themselves. Can run almost every game on Ultra minus some of the aliasing (which doesn't seem optimized in the game not just for how this laptop handles it).   - It also is a great looking and definitely "quality" build. The keys are nice and firm, touchpad is great, the accessibility features are great, and it just feels and looks well made   - It's Asus. I'm not a fanboy but they do provide pretty reliable products, and they seem to be in good business practices. Call them if you have any issues.  Cons:   - It's heavy. As I mentioned above, it's not a laptop for the lap. Place it on any desk and it runs like any other PC.   - The 980m graphics is great, but I was a little mislead by thinking it was just a regular 980x gtx. It's essentially not much different than a 970x. This isn't really a con but just wanted to note it's the only thing I wasn't aware of before purchasing.   - Windows 10 is still working through the kinks. This will be a problem on any pc or laptop so it's not ROG specific, but windows 10 still has issues that go unanswered, which can be frustrating. - Low battery life. This, however, needs to be taken in context. If you're using a high amount of GPU than obviously it will be lower. However, I don't know of any gaming laptop where you can expect to play hours on end without needing to plug in the battery. If that's your goal then you'll need to severely sacrifice the performance specs that you're looking for.  If you are shopping for gaming laptops I would highly recommend this one. I have 0 complaints, only praise. I personally have no intention to ever have my own PC and this laptop is the reason why.  Some tips are to uninstall the Gamefist 3, it seems like a program that's in the works but as of now will cause issues on this laptop. Perform clean graphics updates through geforce experience, if you have any issue with geforce experience check out the forums or feel free to comment here, but that's the best way to keep drivers updates (from time to time, also check the Asus support center to update specific drivers when needed). I also will re-recommend getting in touch with Asus if any issues seems too challenging, they have helped me in the past.
Great  This laptop runs great with windows 7. But i am running it with Linux Ubuntu and it work's great. Very fast and no problem's at all. Ubuntu work's out of the box with no tweaking. Simply great.
Great deal on a really good laptop with a mega hard-drive
the Samsung i5 ATIV is one of the best laptop computers on the market... period!  this i5 ATIV is one of the best laptop computers on the market... period! the build quality and design is stunningly good, it blows the apple products out of the water. functionality is as expected from this i5 unit... fast... quite... and the screen is unmatched!
Yay its here :)  Wow :) very fun and useful. Streaming won't work too ewll Im guessing its the 2 GB mem & low base drive... still very fun all in all and no hitches / signes of disfunction after several weeks
Superb laptop!  I've been using this for about a month now and I will say that it is one of the best decisions I have made when it came to buying a product.  The battery life is rather long, and when it runs low, the charger will charge it in no time, also, the resolution is good enough for watching videos and stuff like that, also, the performance is great so far.  Their are many more things that I could list that are good about this laptop but that's what the other reviewers have already done.  I'm just writing this review to confirm that this is a laptop worth buying, and for 1/5 or less of the price of a macbook pro, it's a no brainer.
Don't be hater  Computer perfection..... worth every penny and more.  There really is nothing like a Mac.  Sure, there are cheaper laptops but what you get is a cheap laptop.
excellent sound system  Light weight, fast start, plenty of ports, excellent sound system. I have several then high end laptops. Everything meet my needs, but the battery cannot last long after 4 or five years. Now they always need power line plugged in. So I need a simple, light weight, HDMI out port for presentations. This ASUS X200 11" is perfect for me.
Clarifications for S7-191-6640 model  There are plenty of good, informative reviews here, but there are some confusing sources of information regarding what's included with this S7-191-6640 model. Some listings of accessories (including Acer's own website) don't list things like the Bluetooth mouse, the case, and/or the adapters (usb-to-Ethernet and microHDMI-to-VGA). All of those came included in my S7-191-6640 box, along with the computer, power-supply and additional, external battery. Additionally, there was a white microfiber cloth with an Acer logo included that came between the keys and screen. I've never seen that mentioned. So if you like to protect the screen from the keys (when folded and in a laptop bag, for example) then know that there might be one included.  Also, the protective case DOES accommodate the s7-191 with the external battery attached. The flap is designed with enough play that it still easily secures while wrapping around the battery. (See my uploaded photo)
Worth every penny  This laptop is fulfilling the video editing needs that I purchased it for.  I am not a gammer, but needed an aggressive GPU, a nice screen and portability.  It's a little big and it certainly has weight but I am happy to carry this beast around knowing that it's going to perform the way I need it to.  The solid state hard drive is extremely impressive.  I was not going to get it, but am so happy that I did.
The Air is great. I like the 11" because it's truly portable. It boots up in 8 sec.
Works great so far
good price/performance  Well, it was cheaper at BestBuy ($1100). This is a nice machine. Large screen. NO FLOPPY, but has a nice CD burner/DVD. The scrollpad on the touchpad is a nice "touch". The button to switch off the touch pad is thoughtful. Hardware supports XP hibernation mode, which is very nice. The RAM and CPU speed are appropriate for heavy multitasking, XP handles multiple windows/tasks just fine. The builtin wireless is great. Only gripes : the speaker grille looks "cheap", the CPU fan exhaust looks like it'd let lots of dust into the inside.
Very good product
excelent buy
very user friendly and easy to set up and use!  This chromebook was for a relative who was just starting out in the computer world. I helped her get started and it seemed quick and user friendly. It seemed to be all anyone would need to use for everyday use. I have a hp chromebook and it seemed very similar to mine which I use all the time at home. I would recommened this chromebook to anyone !
Great Laptop!  Yes you can always gripe about some small issue, but bang for bucks this is a fantastic laptop with little to no limitations!
So far so good  This is my first laptop and so far I love it! I basically use it to access the internet. I haven't put my ITunes on it yet and have stored a few pictures but haven't really had the Vista problems others talk about. My son is using the Light Scribe feature and so far, so good. For the money, the computer is good buy. I love the color. The battery life could be better but I use it most of the time plugged in so no problems. I'm not a computer whiz but I'd recommend this computer to others. I know that it has features that I'll probably never use (my kids will though) but who knows, I might get get wild and use that web cam yet!!
Good Computer  Good computer, no problems out of the box
nice netbook  only had this acer netbook for a day now and it was easy to set-up and start using right out of the box.it does what its supposed to do and thats all i ask.from a amateur at computers.
Great product at a great price!!  Great product at a great price!!
Great Laptop!  We are very happy with this laptop.  It comes with Windows 8 and it's actually easier for a beginner to use this then to learn how to use it after using XP for so long.  It's fast, durable, sleek, lightweight, and very thin!  It is great for everything for which we need it.
Great machine  My old XP laptop was moving out of XP support. My wife loves her Kindle Fire and i could see the value of portability but wanted a key board. At first had trouble adjusting to touch pad and so got a mouse, but have adapted to touch pad and use it rather than the mouse. Work with several senior citizen users and suspect they will find Chromebook ideal especially with the web page zoom feature and larger fonts that make pages senior friendly. Outlook transferred transparently with contacts etc.which was huge. Added Hulu, Pandora, Huffpo, local news and weather to bookmark bar which makes navigation slick. Under Apps "File" is somewhat similar to my computer on Windows and will access your portable drives. Sound is good. Blue tooth a bit spotty and will have to play with. Wow is it fast and the quality is great.  .
Love at first sight !  I just love the ASUS Vivobook E200HA. If you hate touch screens as much as I do, this is the perfect portable solution. I bought it to replace a Chromebook so I'd have a carry-around computer that was compatible with my office laptop. It's very light weight, fits easily in a brief-case, and the battery lasts all day long. It was the best $199 I ever spent. It arrived in 2 days and I had it up and running in 10 minutes. One suggestion, if you do buy one, also get 64GB or larger USB memory stick since this computer is short on memory. I keep all my data on the memory stick which leaves the ASUS free to use all its internal memory. Here's one memory stick I heartily recommend: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FJRS6QY/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1 In summary, If you want a portable laptop for travel or just general use, the ASUS E200HA is the best one you'll find for the money!..
Acer C720 Chromebook  Purchased this Chromebook as another method to connect to the internet.  It was the easiest setup.  Had it up, running, and connected to our wifi in less than 5 minutes.  The battery life is amazing.  For us it is about 10 hours.  Using the microphone to search for sites or items makes surfing easier than ever imagined. We were so impressed with the speed and ease of use that we ordered a second one to use along with our desktop. Going into settings and adding our classic printer was also amazing. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone that does a lot of web surfing and emailing.
Great buy  I like the large screen and great colors. The windows start button makes navigation easy.
perfect for me  The chromebook works perfectly for me. I use google docs for school and watch netflix and hulu. Thats mainly what i need it for and it completely fits my needs. Its light weight so when Im using it and my son decided to jump on me. I can quickly move my laptop with one hand out of the line of fire. I absolutely love it.
Great laptop for the price.  This laptop has excellent performance for the price.  It's fast, looks great, runs cool, is almost silent, has a good screen, and I love the backlit keyboard.  My only complaint is that the lid is a total fingerprint magnet.  I cleaned it up really well and put some Nu-Finish car polish on it, and it's doing a better job at rejecting fingerprints.  I'd recommend giving that a try if you have some in the garage.
Good product  I like this product. Fast and easy to manipulate
Great budget laptop  Well this is a pretty good, solid, fullsize laptop, exactly what I was looking for. It handles my daily chores very well, like email, internet brwosing, office stuff and video streaming. The full size high definition screen looks nice. Colors are crisp and clear. The keyboard is the perfect size for my hands. And the webcam looks much better than my old laptop. It also comes with Windows 10 installed, saved my time upgrading from Win8. So far, I like Win10 better than Win8. And nothing beats the price!
Love it. I am very pleased with this laptop  Love it. I am very pleased with this laptop.  I love the big screen. My pictures and videos come in sharper and the sound is amazing.
Excellent computer and service. I am very happy. It is very very light.
11in chrome book, with touchscreen is great!  I love it!!! I get to the internet fast and find that I use the touchscreen as much as the keyboard. Easy to travel with and has a long battery life. I got the one in white and I'm happy with it being a different color than black. I wanted something I could keep on my couch and be able to just pick it up and be on the internet within seconds. I use it for email, Facebook, playing games and just looking up things my husband and I are talking about. My sons, who are 7, love it and ask when we are getting another one! I'm a simple user, who is not tech savy, so this chrome book is perfect for me
I bought this as my daughter's first computer and it's exactly what she needs for homework, videos and games.
Excellent product recommended.
Easy to Use and Affordable!  I cannot tell you how glad I am I got the Chromebook!  It is SO easy to use, starts up right away, is lightweight and easily portable, and offers all of the benefits of Google.  Just awesome for $249!!
A GIFT  This was a gift for our 17 year old granddaughter. She LOVES it. She'll be using it in her senior year & taking it with her to college. It's like the ones used in her classrooms at school.
NICE!!!  This is a replacement to an ACER that I purchased and returned.  Click on the link to "See all of my reviews" for that information.  Upon opening the package, I found my new ASUS Netbook, which is a cranberry/light burgundy color.  It actually looks very nice and classy; love the color.  First off, I have read some reviews where people have stated that the unit is cheap, isn't solid, etc.  I can tell you that IMHO, this is B.S.  The chiclet keyboard is nice, if you like this technology as opposed to a regular keyboard.  The unit feels VERY solid, light, user friendly, and aesthetically pleasing to the eye.  Afer turning the Netbook on, Windows 7 Home Edition loaded and asked to input information in order to boot up for the first time and complete the initial setup.  Everything went smoothly, including connecting to my Home Network which I had nothing but problems with the ACER Netbook.  Everything has been removed as far as trial programs which generally go over board when you first buy a computer.  On the Netbook, there were only a few that I had to remove so offers to purchase trial software was not bad at all.  The only thing I don't like about this Netbook is the mousepad, which seems to be a common complaint with these type of computers.  Not a big deal since an external/wireless mouse will be purchased.  I just like the feel of a conventional mouse as opposed to a Netbook/Laptop Mouse pad.  I recently purchased a new Samsung TV on Amazon as well and received a free month trial to Netflix.  I did try watching a movie on the Netbook and at first, frames froze and I experienced a lot of lag.  I checked the movie settings and I had it on HD, which was the setting for my TV.  I unchecked that selection and tried again with the Netbook.  PERFECT!  Movie was smooth and played as it should.  I decided to get an ASUS again, since I also purchased an ASUS laptop earlier this year.  I have already used Technical Support and my experience was positive compared to other manufacturers.  I will paste new information and edit this review as I use the Netbook more, but so far so good.  I love it!!!
Great laptop with amazing screen and 5th Gen Core i7  This new model of Dell 15 7000 is great: - The screen looks great, picture quality is brilliant - Its super fast, starts up in less than a minute - Graphics are great - Fairly slim - Build quality feels good, doesn't feel like it would break easily - USB 3.0 ports are great    I would highly recommend this laptop.
It was liked
Love it!!!
the items  very good  good mini laptop thank........
Love the lighted keyboard!  I have had several Chromebooks, and this one is by far my favorite.  Love the lighted keyboard, and the super fast speed.  Larger than all my previous Chromebooks, but still super portable.
Highly recommend, great product!  I love using this Chromebook. I previously had an HP Chromebook which I accidentally dropped and the screen shattered :( Got this as a replacement. I was hesitant at first, since it was nearly double the price of the HP one that I'd bought, but in the end I decided to go for this thinking it would be better than continuing to use my Kindle fire as a makeshift "laptop".  I was definitely blown away by how much BETTER this was than my previous Chromebook. I can actually open multiple tabs, and the thing won't freeze! Sometimes I've fallen asleep watching netflix or youtube, then closed the screen. When I go to open my Chromebook back up, everything is prompt to load/re-load.  I'd highly recommend this for anyone whose primary function for a Chromebook is just email/web surfing/streaming. It's quite excellent!
This was for my Daughter and its perfect!  She loves it!
Awesome product!!!
Great Product  I was real skeptical about buying a used Mac Book online, But I have to say that this product is great and the company is also vey helpful and kind. The Mac Book came quick in the mail and well package and this product is great. I would recommend to buyers to by from this company.
Nice in a sea of never ending new laptops  Really well made and worth the money. Has just about everything.  No problems so far and don't expect any.
ACER  EXCELLENT PRODUCT. IT IS THIN AND LIGHT WEIGHT. THE ONLY LIMITATION IT HAS IS THE MEMORY CAPACITY. THE COLOR IS BEAUTIFUL. IT IS REALLY AN EXCELLENT PURCHASE.
Skyrim runs great on high quality  I was concerned with the amount of people experiencing driver problems. Right when I opened it up I made sure to go to device manager and update everything. There were a few drivers that needed updating, graphics controllers/cards etc. The BIOS was already up to date which surprised me. I noticed the wifi was connected but seemed to always say "identifying" until I did a windows update and now it just says connected and hasn't dropped at all.  Skyrim runs great on high quality. I also played Path of Exile for an hour it crashed at first but haven't had any issues since. The battery seems to tell me it will only last 3 hours on balanced. When I set it to battery saver mode it says I have 7 hours left. Overall I'm very happy with this laptop, it opens and runs programs extremely fast, and is a massive upgrade from my old hp laptop. I don't have a need to upgrade the RAM but it looks pretty easy to install more, there's only one screw on the bottom.  I did extensive research over Black Friday and found this one to have the best components for the price. I actually got it for $665 from amazon's warehouse deals. It is my opinion that this is probably your best bet on a budget gaming laptop.
Its a fine laptop.  The acer I bought has the 6th generation I5 cpu with 17 inch display.  ACER 773G laptop($650) +SSD($120)+ 8gb memory($30) + HD caddy($10) = $810 laptop that offers a terrific value for performance and features.  Price shop to see how much these features would cost you for that out of the box otherwise.  The reviews have been very helpful in upgrading my laptop to its full potential.  What I like most is the HD screen since its not used as mobile laptop for me.  Upgraded the 2nd memory stick.  No reason to get anything faster than 1600 @cl11 unless you upgrade both sticks.  Replaced out the primary HD to SSD and placed a SSHD(1TB w/ 64gb cache) in the caddy to use for storage.  I would have used the stock HD but had the SSHD lying around.  The DVD drive cover can be removed and placed on the caddy so that the laptop body looks unaltered with the caddy installed.  I completely agree with all the posts, a fresh install of Windows 10 is necessary.  Intermediate computer skills needed.  Most laptops are beginner level and have nice access paneling...  I was able to place in the 2nd stick of memory while keeping the display connection and two ribbons on the right side of the board attached to the main board.  After the cpu fan is removed and the main board has been lifted away from the case, the bottom left hand corner has enough room to move around to get to the memory slot underneath.  In the long run, when 6th generation cpu are 3 years out of production, I will probably get the fastest I7 mobile cpu and put that in there but not anytime soon.

Just what it needs to be.  I bought the Chromebook as a writing tool, but also knowing that I would use it for all the many web based behaviors I have developed. It works perfectly for the way I use a laptop, is way more useful than trying to write on a tablet, and it's just right for carrying around. The keyboard is really nice to use.  The Chromebook is not pretending or trying to be the latest, best, fastest, most techno bit of up to date soon to be out dated device. It is not a brand new shiny Apple that will be old news in six months, it is not the latest and greatest Windows whatever,it does not have the most advanced screen, and so what, everything on the screen looks good to me. It is a simple, functional tool that is very reasonably priced and works incredibly well, and what else does it need to be?
Perfect for on-the-go!  Purchased this laptop to carry to and from work and school. It's small, lightweight, fits perfectly into my backpack (without weighing it down), and does everything I need it to do!
very nice but cannot use a couple of  third party apps written for PCs.  Anything that is browser based works very well, it is very light and starts in a couple of seconds
Great customer service and the computer works very well.
great unit  great little computer with good back up
Powerful portable machine with excellent performance. We are using it for video processing both 2D and 3D and everything is smooth and fast. The screen has a superb quality and very bright colors.
Bought it for the Linux Support, not for ChromeOS  Hands down one of the best laptops I have paid a little over 200 dollars for. Does the job in GNU\Linux (Xubuntu 14.04) well. Requires some kmods for trackpad but easily doable. Battery life is still great even in the other operating system.
Fast performance, increditble price for what you get.  It's about a month old and no issues thus far. I'm very happy with my purchase. I did update the graphics driver with a new available version and had to disable an ASUS program from starting because of a conflict with the graphics software.  ASUS advised me on that and it worked.  I'm not a gamer.  I use the computer for graphics, Adobe CS6.  The monitor is very sharp and CS6 works perfectly because the monitor is not 4K.  I had purchased and returned a new Dell XPS because the 4K monitor was not compatible with CS6 and rendered the buttons so tiny I could not see them.  The Dell computer was very nice but double the price and the ASUS has more features, more everything for half the price.  It boots up incredibly fast and programs launch quickly.  It's larger and heavier than the XPS and the materials may not be as nice, but for half the price, I don't mind because the performance is awesome.  The keyboard is very good, has a good feel.  The dark surface shows fingerprints terribly, but again, that does not bother me.  This was a great purchase and I'd buy it again.
Just what I was looking for.  It came in great condition!
but this amazing electronic has 256 SSD  I finally bit the bullet and after much research, decided on this one. It doesnt advertise it, but this amazing electronic has 256 SSD.. which makes it is lightening fast, super light weight, intel i5. I couldn't be happier with my choice!
I needed an unfancy, inexpensive laptop that still runs Windows 7 and this item arrived promptly, is exactly as advertised and works fine. I really appreciate when I get a product that meets my expectations at a reasonable price.
Love this laptop its small but works great
looks great works great  i was skeptical, but its legit. it was affordable came fast and was flawless, the battery life may be 4-7 hours, but other than tat all is well. mag-safe charger, extension. original box. all is well. will def buy again from this seller
Exactly what I needed for Photoshop  So far its excellent.  It's very fast....matches the speed of my Asus desktop.  I am a photographer and freelance editor, and I bought this laptop for work while traveling.....definite must have for my Photoshop needs.  So far, so great!
This laptop is amazing! It is totally worth getting  This laptop is amazing! It is totally worth getting. I love the fact that I could connect two extra monitors making me have three screens to play around with.  The keyboard is awesome! It is very solid and love the clicking sounds when you type on it.
Awesome gaming laptop with gtx 980 graphic card  Awesome gaming laptop with gtx 980 graphic card. I upgraded another 16 gig of ram and replace standard SSD hard drive with a 1 tb SSD Samsung. Laptop is a beast!
excelente maquina, excelente precio  woao, es increible la respuesta de esta maquina de verdad no le veo defecto alguno, y menos por su precio, trabajo con logic y puedo procesar todo, abrir mas canales de los que estaba acostumbrado a usar, y ni siquiera he aumentado su capacidad de memoria ram, me alegro por haber hecho esta compra. La pantalla no molesta en lo absoluto y el trackpad es tan suave que provoca amarlo... Apple se boto con esta nueva macbook pro, y amazon, la hizo llegar a mi casa integra y en perfectas condiciones.
i love it so far  i love it so far. its exactly what i expected to receive and for the price an extremely good deal!
Best PC Ultrabook Right Now  Just a great device. Sometimes it feels a bit flimsy and not as solid as a Macbook Air, but overall everything about it is fantastic.  1. Awesome battery life--most days, I can bring it to school (w/out charger) and it'll last anywhere from 8-10 hours, depending on how I use it. 2. Super sleek--looks great, and the screen is actually larger than it appears. Though it's a 15in screen, it has the frame of a 14. 3. Fantastic sound--surprisingly, the sound system is quite clear, and can reach pretty loud levels. 4. Solid trackpad--multitouch functions work well, and I almost never use an external mouse 5. Solid keyboard--feels similar to the Macbook keyboard, but I love that the right side has all the End/Home/etc. keys. Makes things easier.
Awesome laptop that has served me well for almost 2 years now.
Perfect laptop for my daughter and for the price  Perfect laptop for my daughter and for the price. I ended up buying 3..one for each daughter. Highly recommend buying the protection plan. One was only 14 days old and dropped on the tile floor. It was beyond repair. I was reimbursed the purchase price via Amazon gift card. This process took a bit longer than I thought it should but protection plan well worth the price and simple process.
Great computer  This is a great computer for me, small compact, works well. It does take some getting used to, because of the differences from Windows. Once you get used to those, it's easy. I use it for various things, and have no problem.
The better of the cheap 11e on prime day  I've seen this one, but I've not done more than play with a third generation 11e. But, I've owned 2 and installed a lot of 11e laptops and they're all about the same as far as the shell. They really haven't changed the shape and size of the laptop much if at all in this third generation.  There are three of these 11e as Prime Day sales: The $200 gen 1 has 4GB ram, a low power Celron processor, 500 GB spinning disk. I don't like a spinning disk for a laptop. It makes it so much more fragile since spinning disks are susceptible to failure because of bumps and movement. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VPKT8LG/ref=gbdp_vlo_dc2163e3_B00VPKT8LG?_encoding=UTF8&smid=A1KWJVS57NX03I  This $250 gen 3 has 8GB of ram, a low power Celron processor, 128GB SSD. I think it's a good step up for $50. Even though newer, the atom processor is practically the same as the $200 one. With a 11 inch screen, I really can't see how you're going to be multitasking enough that the 8GB of ram will really help you, but sure it's nice that you get it!  The $350 gen 2 has 4 GB of ram, a much faster Pentium M processor, and 128GB hard drive. It's a much faster CPU--about twice as fast. It's also a touchscreen and flips over because it's the Yoga version. https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-Generation-Convertible-Ultrabook-Touchscreen/dp/B014LQHW4A/ref=sr_1_6?m=A1KWJVS57NX03I&s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1468322974&sr=1-6&refinements=p_6%3AA1KWJVS57NX03I  I like the $350 one because of the faster CPU and it converts to a tablet and has a touchscreen. But you are paying 40% more than the $250 model. So if you want cheap and good enough to do your basic things, the $250 one is great. If you want more power and a touchscreen, get the $350 model.  I think the 11e is one of the best bangs for your buck in the cheaper laptops. Especially being very portable, but being tough. They're a little clunky for an 11 inch, but in that same way they feel like they can take a beating.  PS. the weight is wrong. It weights just over 3 pounds.
Great little laptop  Great little laptop. A little learning curve involved when moving from a PC but once you catch on, it's very user friendly.
It is a Very good product Thank you fot ask
Can't beat it for the price.  Long Battery Life. Pretty good sound for laptop speakers, and pretty durable build construction. There's no lag for Facebook, Netflix streaming, etc.  Can't beat it for the price.
Love this chrome book  Love this chrome  book. It is so easy to use, i love watching movies on it the volume is expectacular! It plays music beautiful.  This is exacly what I wanted. I love how the apps are already there you just click on what you want to use. Perfect for people who are technically challenged like me.
Asus GL752W DH74  This is a great laptop and desktop replacement. Very fast. Only drawback I can find is that is doesn't support PCIe NVME drives.  The video response is good and the sound is acceptable. Highly recommended.
Great MacBook better prixe  Perfect computer. Specs were good and price was great. Received it and have no issues at all.
Dell Inspiron Laptop  Bought this laptop for my wife for her college use.  The laptop works great and meets all my expectations and the price was right.
Best laptop ever I work as a doctor and sure maybe 7 or 8 keys don't work but who uses the n let o key the t key the g key the y key the a key and the right arrow who needs those but this is the best computer ever would highly recommend
Use daily for watching movies and the battery lasts forever!
Great connectivity  I think the other reviewers have done a brilliant job and I fully agree with their assessments. I would only add the following points regarding ports......  I was all set to buy an 11.6" Airbook. That plan came to a screeching halt when I discovered that it didn't have an Ethernet port. The best you could do was to buy a separate USB dongle that would provide 10/100 Ethernet. For an IT professional who is used to walking into a client's server room and taking a 50GB backup copy of a database in no time via gigabit ehternet that was just not going to work out. I don't fancy stepping back to 1990! Also a lot of hotels only have wired Ethernet and I just want to be able to plug in and go. Not spend time playing find-the-adapter.  I also found out that the Airbook has a mini DisplayPort. To plug into an external VGA monitor you need (yep, you guessed it) another adapter. To plug into a TV or projector you need yet another adapter for HDMI. All these are sold separately and are more junk to cart around the world. They are also the exact thing that you would find that you have lost (or left back in the hotel) just when you needed to plug into a projector to give a presentation ;)  So I was all set to lay out serious $$$ on a Sony ultra-portable when I came across the TimelineX. I've had it for a month now and I couldn't be happier with it. For the professional on the road that doesn't want to lug around some 15.6" monster this little guy is the perfect replacement. Compared to the Sony ultra-portables the price is outstanding value.
Superb laptop  terrific computer , rugged and fast, worth the extra cost
this laptop is amazing it is mainly for gamers but i use it for editing at 60fps i highly recommend to buy this buget laptop u will not find better
PREFECT PC FOR ANYONE! LOVE IT!  I just bought this from Best Buy for $1,399.00. I love the look and the size. Its very fast with the QUAD PROCESSOR compared to the normal core duo. The LED screen is prefect for watching movies and playing games is very smooth with this graphics card! And I love Windows 7! Overall this Hp is perfect!!
perfect laptop with an affordable price  i bought two of these laptop for my grand kids birthdays and they loved them they always try to use them when the can then price is great and the laptops work perfect
I've used a Mac and this laptop does everything it could do at a fraction of the cost.
Refurbished Macbook Pro 15" purchase  I got the laptop in good condition except the firewire connections didn't recognize my external hard drives. Now that's a bummer. Since the item was refurbished and not brand new, i immediately bought Apple Care to cover potential repair costs and it was a great decision because the logic board had to be replaced rightaway. But now i'm happily using it, so no complaints. Amazon's service was excellent, as usual.
Great purchase.  Great purchase.!  Came with loads of extra stuff (everything described in the ad.)  Also arrived on the first day of the time allotted.  Seller was very friendly and helpful with my questions.
Work of art  PROS: Fast, sleek, powerful, work of art!! CONS: Shiny screen  I love this ultrabook!  I am a IT solution developer and have all kinds of apps installed on this, including SQL 2012, and full Visual Studio.  It is indeed my office in a...notebook.  When home I seamlessly plug it into my plugable docking station to extend to 2 additional monitors, full size keyboard and mouse, speakers, video/mic, printer, and external hard-drive.  The keyboard feels very roomy and buttons are sleek but have nice touch and very responsive.  The screen is unbelievably amazing for video and photos but is shiny so may be annoying in certain lighting.  As a lefty who does not switch buttons, I've never liked the touchpad so my opinion is useless.  I've not had any issues with drivers or such - it does come with a Samsung utility that constantly looks for software and driver updates, which is slightly annoying for someone who just likes to control the whole process, but I did let it apply some updates (including firmware) and there were no issues.  I do have issues with Win8 app font sizing (rendering some of them useless on extended monitors) and some command and property boxes also have a font size that can even make it impossible for me to see options, but I suspect this is Win8 issue so can hardly blame Samsung.
Thank God!  I was in the market for a laptop for the longest, and was struggling with which company to go to. Many of these manufacturer's I had never heard of, so I narrowed my decision down to HP, Dell, and Apple. Since I already have a Macbook, and wanted to try out Windows 8 I decided to go with HP. What deterred me from Dell is there customer service, which destroyed my laptop in the warehouse apparently forcing me to choose another model or just get a refund. I chose the refund!   Anyway, I wanted a Full HD desktop replacement and saw the Envy line, which had the look of a macbook pro which I liked. I was kind of skeptical at first after reading so many reviews on Amazon about HP's customer service, or their quality (or lack thereof) in their laptops. To my surprise this laptop's trackpad is scrolling just fine and no overheating issues as well. The only problem I have is that if I don't use the lock trackpad feature before I start typing, my left hand will brush over the trackpad causing the cursor to move to another area. When this happens, either what I was typing ends up in another area on the screen amist other text, or a paragraph that I just entered gets deleted entirely. I realize that the trackpad is off-centered, and while I don't understand this new trend in laptops I'm able to adjust easily.    So maybe I just happened to get a great model, or HP's quality is really improving with their newer models! All I know is that I'm happy with my purchase, and that people will not have to fear getting this specific model if they find it available.
Great laptop!  Great laptop for the money !!!! Got it for my boyfriend wish I would of got one for myself. I may yet!
very pleased for the price does what I need.
Nothing beats a Macbook!  I've had so many laptops and desktops and nothing beats a Macbook! I've had my Macbook Pro for two years already and it works just as good as when I bought it. I've always had issues with PCs slowing down and getting viruses, but not with my Macbook. It definitely is expensive but it is well worth it! The Macbook Pro is durable and sturdy. The software is wonderful and easy to use. I have nothing to complain about my Macbook. The only thing that went wrong was my hard drive went faulty after a year but it was so easy and cheap to replace it with a new one. I haven't had any problems since. I hope to get many more years out of it.
Love this computer  Love this computer! I needed something affordable but reliable for word documents and web browsing and this does this trick perfectly! It took some time getting used to the new windows format but it's actually a nice change, so I have no complaints. The average shipping took even less time than expected, which was another nice surprise.
Overall, yes this is a great buy!  Nothing is without flaws and this laptop DOES have a few. Luckily, they are minor. By reading the specs and the other reviews, I am sure that you are well aware at how well this laptop performs. It can play most modern games on high settings. Now the down sides don't seem to be covered quite as well, so in the off chance that any of them are deal breakers for you, this is everything I can possibly find to nitpick about:  1. The touchpad. It actually isn't bad once you get it configured... but that is the thing, you have to configure it. I had to uninstall the driver, reinstall it and then find the touchpad settings in the tray and fiddle with them until I got what I wanted. For instance, the option to have the mouse pad turn off when you are typing, sounds like a great idea but when you are playing a game like GTA and it requires you to press the "WASD" keys while using the mouse pad... well you're gonna have a bad time. It shuts down the touchpad when you press any letter key. Go ahead and do yourself a favor and turn this feature off. 2. The touchpad placement/size. The touchpad is HUGE and it often gets in the way when you are typing.... or at least for most people it does. I had an ASUS laptop before this one and it had a similar issue so I have adapted to typing in such a way that I avoid the touchpad entirely. Still, it took me time to get used to so it should be mentioned. 3. The glossy finish. Damn this really irks me. My previous laptop had this same type of finish... why do manufacturers do this?! You can see every smudge, fingerprint, scuff, and speck on this thing... if you are OCD, it might kill you. 4. The hard drive. The boot times are pretty slow, the load times in games are pretty slow as well... it is a 5400 rpm drive. It isn't all too impressive. However, the laptop DOES have an extra hdd bay so you can buy an SSD and put the OS on that. 5. All side ports. The back of the laptop is completely free of any kind of ports whatsoever. Acer has put everything on the sides. It is a minor issue but for me, the power cord is on the opposite side of the laptop (Right) from where my power outlet is (Left). 6. *Windows 8. I put the asterisk there because I am actually quite fond of Windows 8, but it is a bit different from previous versions and takes some tweaking to be good. I recommend downloading "startisback" as soon as you power up the thing. It installs the Windows 7 start menu back into the taskbar and allows you to boot straight to the desktop. 7. No backlight on the keyboard. This one makes me sad. I really want a backlit keyboard :( 8. HUGE. Now I like the size but some may not quite understand just how big this laptop is... it is HUGE. I don't have a tape measure with me but it looks to be nearly 20 inches wide!  OK now I can tell you that despite the above list, I LOVE this laptop. You will not find a better gaming laptop for under 1000 bucks, I promise you that!
good
Great little laptop  Wanted something small to bring to classes and take notes on, this seems like it will be perfect.  No problems with it yet, just still getting used to Windows 8.
Would buy again...great seller!  Super fast shipping! Ordered on Fri got it Monday. Computer was in good shape. Just a few small nicks and the back where the screen is attached there is a crack. Definitely from a drop but it's not noticeable and nothing that bothers me. I slapped a case on it and kept it moving. The plus for me was there was MS office installed which is awesome! Got this for my 14 yr old daughter so this is perfect.
Chromebook love!  My old Acer was just about shot, so I ordered the Chromebook.  LOVE it!  I was surprised how easily it set up, and how quickly all my information came over from my Google account.  My bookmarks were even there!  Start-up and shut-down are ridiculously fast, and the screen is very clear.  It is, as we say, the berries!
Nice small laptop  We needed a small Windows10 PC for simple Internet access.  This works fine and is surprisingly responsive.  The  screen is small yet quite legible.
No Need for a Desktop  I bought this for myself to use as a work laptop. Since moving, and switching professions, I gave it to my daughter as a temporary hold until I could afford to get her a desktop of her own. I'm not getting it back. :-) It turns out that the laptop has almost as much memory and storage as my desktop in a much smaller package, and with many fewer parts. The only thing that doesn't seem to work, after about 9 months, is the wi-fi card, which did work when I got it, but stopped working after our move. However, we have a very long Ethernet cable so my daughter can get online when she needs to do so. She uses it for everything you would need it to do: homework, creative projects, email, watching DVDs. As I said, I don't think I'm getting it back and I don't see me needing to buy her a desktop when this much more portable option is just as powerful. She just needs to remember to charge it every few days, depending on how much it's used during the week.
Excelente
Lives up to expectations  I've had no problem with the laptop to speak of, the screen is quite readable and bright, it plays the various games I've tried at high levels of graphics (Age of Empires III, Battle for Middle-earth I and II, and similar games).
Couldn't be more satisfied  I have had a macbook since I was in college, and I loved it. When it finally died, my initial urge was to purchase a macbook air because of how much I loved my former apple laptop and of course the sleek design is pretty convenient. However, the $900 price tag felt like a little too much for a 20-something with student loan payments, rent, and other expenses on a non profit salary. I start researching other options, and realized a chromebook would suit my needs - when I use my computer to work from home, I always use google drive so I can easily access my files from the office or home, and beyond that there isn't much that I need other than internet access. I am not a gamer or a designer, so the Chromebook has everything that I need! I ordered this particular chromebook because of the slim and lightweight design that I found so attractive in the macbook air. I couldn't be happier that I took the chance! I love this machine, it is quick and the operating system is so easy to use. I haven't come across a single limitation yet after two weeks of use.  At the same time, I purchased one for my mother who is very, very bad with technology (she once tried to give me her email password when I asked for the wi-fi password). She only needs a computer for online banking and bill payments, facebook and playing some games. She lives in a different city so I was a little worried when I sent it to her but she had absolutely no problem getting it set up and jumping right into use on her own. She loves how easy it is to use and I don't have to worry about her complaining several months from now about slowing speed or viruses that she accidentally downloaded.  I would recommend this to any average user who is looking for a new laptop with a low price tag!
Well constructed and a good value for the price  Well constructed and a good value for the price. Received an excellent condition one even though with refurbished sticker on it, did not notice any wearing. Plenty of RAM and storage space. Runs fast, nothing to complain.
Great value  Practically new appearance. Very solid design. Incredibly low price for a notebook of this performance. I'm very pleased. Delivery was fast also.
An excellent choice, not a rip-off like an Alienware.  Works like a treat for close to 4 years, and still can run high-end games with minimal lag. HOWEVER be advised that it's a liquid screen display so the laptop WILL break instantly if you try and use it on the surface of Mars. Don't make the same mistake I did!
Its fast and easy to use  This is a Christmas gift to our son he absolutely loves it. Its fast and easy to use.
Great College Laptop!  I bought this laptop about a month ago in preparation for college in the fall.  I had been a Windows user all my life, and little did I know what I was missing!  The Mac OS runs flawlessly and intuitively, I have yet to have any problems with it.  I even installed Windows on my laptop and found that the Mac OS was still far superior. I also love it because it is completely customizable -- even most of the settings are easy to change and make for a pleasant experience. This laptop is worth every penny you'll spend on it.  It's reliable and very resilient....it even fell off my bed and still functions perfectly. Also, the Bluetooth Mighty Mouse is a very worthwhile investment.  It makes everything MUCH easier to use (especially scrolling and right clicking). I plan on buying Macs only from now on!
Perfect for my mild gaming needs  I researched laptops for weeks trying to figure out what I wanted, what I could afford, and what I needed from my laptop, and I definitely made the right choice with this one. I have had this laptop for nearly 6 months now and I could not be happier with my purchase. If you are a mild gamer who doesn't need the high end gaming laptop this is the product for you. With the dedicated VRAM for your graphics card and the integrated intel/nvidia graphics card I can set all my graphics settings to ultra high without performance issues from games including Skyrim, Fallout New Vagas, Battlefield 3, and Tomb Raider. Overall this is a great everyday laptop as it is thin, easy to transport, great at multitasking, and looks pretty good too. The only issue I have, which i see MANY people commenting on, is the touch pad; its ridiculously touchy! Other than that its a great buy and fits the niche of those wanting an everyday laptop with the ability to do a little gaming as well. A great buy and worth the investment.
Even though description is the 2014 model I received the 2015 model.  I did a lot of research and decided for some gaming and business this was a good balance between price and performance.  If you want a really high end gaming laptop with the latest gpu then you will be spending a thousand or two more depending on how high end you go and then you will have a really thick laptop that is a heat monster.  Then again if you buy a nice $1,000 laptop and try and run games on it you will get too much lag.  Anyway I decided on this and it is awesome.  I am not going into all the details but there is one IMPORTANT thing I wanted to mention.  If you read the specs of the laptop on Amazon you will realize the specs describe last years model, but if you tried to order the current Omen of the HP website and get the 16 gigs of Ram and the 512 gig hard drive with the faster cpu and new gpu it will cost you about $300 to $400 more than this model.  I was hopping that since HP doesn't seem to make last years model that if I ordered this I might actually get this years model (and not last years stock that was sitting in the back of someones store) with the 960gpu and the faster i7 processor, but I was prepared to get the 860gpu with the slightly slower processor.  To my happy surprise this is the new model with the 960 gpu and the faster processor.  Obviously since the description has the older gpu and processor if you order you might get an older one, but if that is what was holding you back and pushing you to order directly from HP I would order this one on Amazon and save the $300 to $400 bucks.  The model number is L3Y55AV#ABA which translate to HP OMEN Notebook - 15t-5100.
I lOVE MY CHROMEBOOK  I Love my Chromebook its very easy for a novice to figure out and is so fast compared to my desktop computer. I love everything about it. Would suggest it to anyone especially those that can be challenged on a computer. I beleieve my mom and dad would be able to use a Chromebook. Another Great product from Samsung!!
Apple Mac Pro  Delivered on time and such a great product
i add a 120g m5p ssd  i added a 120g m5p ssd from dvd bay. i formated the old system and reinstall win7 system.  i encountered one time system freeze since today, and then i upgraded intel chip driver(can bus driver missing after the system freeze).  so far so good. i use many thinkpad laptops but i still cannot get used to the keyboard. There is no capital led, of course i disable the touch panel which can cause a lot of wrong input.
Works great so far.
Does what we need well.  After start-up it was quite slow to respond. However, I took the advise of other reviewers and removed the pre-loaded games and useless software and it works fine. I feel for anyone that tries to use one of these out-of-the box. It would be very frustrating. I'm glad I saw the reviews from others. My two school-age children like it because of it's size and ease of using the internet for games and school work, etc.
Because of my job, I use to travel a lot, and 2 laptops on your shoulder (one for work, one personal).. mmm you better get a slim and light computer is you want to be comfortable. This computer is great for overall use, very fast, very light and thin! (did I mentioned is super light?), I'm a photography enthusiast so even Photoshop CC and Lightroom CC run nice and fast. Windows startup in 4 or 5 secs, office 2013 runs really smooth. Battery life is really good. What else can I say? if you need a light computer with great quality/performance/price ratio, don't look for more, this is the choice to go.
goooood
Cheaper than other brands  It's a powerful laptop... For gaming and office use. Cheaper than other brands.
Love it.  Love it....fast and battery life is amazing. No crap ware, no cleaning...just works. Setting up a printer to google cloud a bit tough for my wife but it does a great job with remoting into work and everything else she needs. We got the 4g so that probably helps. I believed in chromebooks before this but I now can testify...great device
Works perfect.
just perfect :)
Let's Get Married, Darling  I absolutely love this PC! This computer has the best of both worlds when it comes to having the speed of a chromebook while still having the productivity of a conventional computer such as windows software compatibility, an adequate number of USB ports, and a convenient micro SD card slot. The machinery within this computer is also extremely straight-forward. By this, I mean that when you go about doing your business whether uploading, downloading, or sending .APK files to multiples interfaces, this PC performs to one's expectations -- no need to learn complex algorithms or tedious processes that are inherent within Acer Chromebooks, etc. As a side note, the storage within the hardware is rather small, but the PC compensates for many venues of both cloud and external-hardware-storage options -- one option where the PC includes 100 GB of cloud storage for free. Overall, I am extremely pleased with the product in-of-itself. Being that this nifty little PC is within the $200 dollar range, my heart flutters with joy and happieness. Thanks for reading, and have a wonderful day.
Good condition and works great
Nice  I had it for a few months now.  I dislike window8..  The touchpads left and right click is a little akward, but for a laptop at the price it works nicely and  Everything is functioning as it should.
Very impressed! Still working perfectly!
Perfect basic laptop for my mom.  If just want a plain workhorse, this is your product.
Great Buy  I had been looking at computers on the Dell website and saw a model I liked. Came to Amazon and searched the model and found a refurbished one of the same model, with same hardware and features. Being refurbished, it was considerably less than listed on the Dell site. It's been good to me so far.
iview is perfect for anybody.  I order it as a gift.. I didn't think much when I open it.. But once I check the features of the mini netbook it was worth It & more.. It does everything a real laptop & tablet would offer.. Great battery life has the android market with all the amazing apps. Can't go wrong with this price.. I have to say i was really impressed.. Good for any age..
great product
ASUS VivoBook X202E-DH31T 11.6-Inch Touch Laptop  laptop is great! battery life is amazing i haven't used it in 2 weeks and still 3/4 battery life in it like wow! and when i do use it to watch movies or tv shows its life span is still incredibly high with 6hrs nonstop entertainment. windows 8 is new to me and cant find how to bring up the calculator... but no biggie thats why we have cell phones... right? anyways overall the computer is great! im a college student and have ebooks for my books so that cuts down ALOT of weight in my backpack, and under 3lbs this is by far way lighter then my 17inch laptop that weighs a hefty 7lbs. resolution is good for a 11.5 inch screen and touch screen features are cool makes scrolling and zooming in on books easier.
Best choice for internet browsing.  I like the way my Acer Chromebook 15 boots up and comes on line so much faster than my Windows 10.  The case is made nicely so it won't slip out of my hand or off my lap.  I should like to know if it has automatic shutdown in the event of overheating.  Can I put it on the bed (blocking the cooling ports) and not have to worry.  So far, the Chrome system has been free of any bugs.  I recommend this for an older person who just wants a trouble-free computer to use for the internet.
Pros: Battery Life, Big Screen, Simple OS, Low Price  Perfect for all the daily emails, google docs and carrying around from meeting to meeting. It's not as fast, the screens not as clear and the OS isn't as full featured as my Mac but since I can buy 4 of these for the price of one Macbook I'm cool with that. Oh yeah, it also lasts about a day and a half of use without needing a charge and never gets hot. Plus I get 100GB of storage worth $25 too. Thanks Google. Chromebooks can't do everything I need but they can do 90%. For me a mac mini works perfect for the other 10%. Going to upgrade my wife's old Samsung Chromebook to this Asus C300 and I've almost sold my co-worker on one too.  A backlit keyboard would be an awesome feature in the future.
RE: Dell D630 computer  Even as a used computer, the laptop works flawlessly.  We  have had no problems with any of the programs. Thanks.
Mailed it back  This was a great laptop - I liked it so much I sent it back!  Why? Because the new and improved models came out for about the same price and 50% faster! Now I just wish Amazon would help me out by discounting the re-stocking fee since I am essentially upgrading!<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Apple-MacBook-Pro-MC373LL-A-15-4-Inch-Laptop/dp/B003G2ZKLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Apple MacBook Pro MC373LL/A 15.4-Inch Laptop</a>
Just great!  This notebook is a piece of art, not just because of it's great looking or material quality but performance is awesome!!!!
nice
My Macbook pro on travel for video editing !  Good service, like described !  The laptop has done a great distance.... from US to Spain .... France ... Belgium, without problems! Only minor problems ! some programs didn't work with Maverick, but found a solution for it ! Only regret, that there is no other laptop with 17 " screen and usb3 ports (3 pcs and Firewire)
Just get it, you'll be happy you did!  This laptop is VERY powerful.  I have had it for 6 months now, with no problems and no issues.  The ONLY thing that I care to upgrade on this machine is the HDD..... SSD is in the budget for a future upgrade.  Other than that, it runs AutoCad very well and very fast.  Skyrim runs at native resolutions, NO slowing WHATSOEVER.  Lord of Shadows 2 (Castlevania) is crisp, detailed and smooth, by far better than other laptops I have used.  Battery use is good, considering the horsepower that it cranks out... Skyrim runs for about an hour at max resolutions on the battery.  Other functions, like Office products or surfing the web get as much as 6 hours battery life, making it a good school solution for me.  The RAM NEVER GETS ABOVE 15% USAGE, NO MATTER WHAT I'M DOING.  Excellent buy, and Computer Upgrade King was a great supplier.  They shipped it to Alaska for me, on a remote job site location, and I had it in 5 days.  Excellent service.  They also took the time to find and install the right kind of RAM in the first place (this machine takes a non-standard 1.35V chipset, in case you're curious).  Two thumbs WAAAAAY up!!~
Amazing  The best laptop, it's not a simple computer, the image it's amazing and very easy to used, I will recommended for all
Great purchase  My daughter loves this computer. She stays on it about 4 hours a day. It has everything she needs. I had a problem with the plug and sent MechaTek an e-mail on 4/16/11. They sent me an e-mail on 4/18/11 and they are shipping a new one out today 4/18/11 because it's still under the 90-day warranty. I recommend buying from MechaTek because of their excellent customer service and quality of product.
Good product  So far so good, exactly what I was looking for, good balance between performance and price. Good product. Until today no defect on hardware. Struggled a little bit with the optimus support on Linux, and followed this guide (similar model) to make work the NVIDIA discrete card: [...] Still no output from the ACER proprietary VGA output. Touchscreen works out of the box. Special keys for backlight doesn't work  On Windows 8 and 8.1 I haven't found any problems yet. On the gaming side, I have seen some reviews that this laptop is not so good, but practically can run most of the latest games with a decent frame rate with at least high settings at 1920x1080. Last game I checked is Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. I'm not so  sure for the coming 2014 games
Speedy, beautiful, and impressive...  I'd previously owned the first $1099 white Macbook that Apple introduced when the switched to using Intel chips. It was a good machine, but this one blows it out of the water. Not only does it take on some of its older brother's look, but it truly is an impressive machine with the the additional touch pad.  Pros:  - Beautiful, seamless design similar to the previous Macbook Pro aluminum design - Easy to open compartment on the bottom for accessing the hard drive, battery, and RAM - Doesn't get very "Hot." I've yet to think I need to put it on something when its on my lap, even despite watching DVDs or doing other intensive work. - Quick little machine. As mentioned, blows my original Macbook out of the water - Side Battery Readout - Touch Pad (this is a plus and minus) - Bright, LED screen (although its glossy, I personally prefer the matte finish) - New Nvidia graphics chipset... Much better than the Intel GMA  Cons:  - Sometimes, for me, the track pad doesn't "click" (seems to be a known issue now), and, even occasionally not even work. It just stops moving the mouse despite me moving my finger - The glossy display, like all other glossy displays, reflects a decent amount - $[...] model doesn't include the backlit keyboard (Why??) - Wish RAM was a little easier to access, but not too bad. Previous design was easier - Wish this was the intro Macbook model - No longer includes remote for FrontRow (or maybe mine was missing?) - No Firewire 400 port  Overall, this is a fantastic computer. Worth pretty much every penny I paid for it ([...]). The biggest issue I have with it is the trackpad, but, from what I've read, Apple will be releasing a fix for that soon.
Excellent macbook, perfect size and weight
So far so good.  It is doing everything I need it to do.
dell laptop  this is a nice laptop. have not had any problems with it yet. has some minor scuff marks on it but other then that it works good. i un-installed the clam win anti virus that comes with it and installed avira anti-vir on it. it does not come with recovery disks but you can make your own however mine took 11 CD-rs as it would not let me burn it to dvd.you will need nero or other burning software to split the data onto 11 CD-Rs as it won't do it by it-self. you will have to save the backup data to your HD then use your burning software to create a backup cd and select the file from your HD. once its done burning to the cds make sure to delete it from the HD and reboot to clear it.
Great Buy!  Amazing little laptop, love it! Product came as described.
This little Netbook can hold its own!  I have been looking for an inexpensive netbook to run Linux on for a little while now and this was about the best price I could find.  I run Mint on my main rig; but, I needed something a bit more mobile so I could work away from my desk.  The specs are not spectacular.  However, for $210 dollars I think they are adequate and the computer should be able to run most Linux Distros stably.  I'm running Xubuntu 13.10 which uses Xfce (which is more resource efficient than Unity) and have been impressed with this computers speed.  I also use the chromium browser over the stock Firefox (though, Firefox is equally fast) and have no problem surfing the web and streaming videos.  It appears that there are some mixed reviews in terms of this computer's ability to do basic tasks (web browsing, text/document editing, and emailing).  In my experience this computer handles all of these basic computing tasks quickly and without any problems.  I also noticed that most people strongly dislike the touch pad on this computer.  I feel like I may be one of the few; but, I actually like it.  In my opinion the touch pad on this device is better than any other laptop I've used in this price range.  Admittedly it is quite 'touchy' but there are configuration options in Ubuntu based distros to help deal with this and prevent things like mis-clicks and other unwanted touchpad activity.  I am very happy with this netbook.  It is small and quick.  It handles all the tasks I need it for without any issues.  I've even installed steam and successfully run several low-resource indie games.  The battery life isn't terribly long (lasting about 2-3 hours) but I find a place to plug in at most places that I go. While it won't replace my main desktop environment I still highly recommend it for anyone who wants a cheap Linux machine to do some basic computing tasks.
This is an extremely premium gaming laptop. I'll list some pros and cons just to keep this review short.  Pros (+) -Very fast -Nice 1080p screen that is bright and good viewing angles -Amazing battery life for the specs -great sounding speakers -Very premium feel -Ran my games with no lag whatsoever  Cons (-) -Speakers could be a little bit louder, however this is not a huge con as it would be distorted like other laptops if it was any louder -outside gets fingerprints (really an issue with most laptops, but I thought I'd include here because I noticed it, not that you'd notice it while using laptop though)  All in all, I've purchased laptops for around the same price that weren't as high quality as this. So, I must deem this a buy!
my daughter loved it so much she bought one as well  i am really enjoying my irulo walknbook. my daughter loved it so much she bought one as well. i am happy too, that the windows 10 is easier than i expected. i often use it as a laptop, but to have the option of using the keyboard, or the touch screen is such a plus. works well for all my computer needs.
Great 'puter, great value.  I love it.  Plenty of power and disk space.
What a steal! Review for first-time Thinkpad users  I got this on Amazon for $250.00. It's a ridiculously amazing deal. Mine came with the attachable dock/drive-- totally unexpected, and made me even happier with the bargain. I also got an extra 1gb of ram (total of 2gb).  The computer is slick weighing in at about 3.5lbs. I feel like a secret agent carrying it around (I'm also a [multiple] Macbook Pro owner, so I love compact quality). The laptop is incredibly sturdy, as Thinkpads are expected to be. For a business user, this is a much better deal than most of the consumer laptops on the market. The keyboard is small, but not too crowded for typing comfortably. The keys are solid and don't feel like they're going to pop off any second.  The trackpad (stick) takes some getting used to. I wouldn't recommend traveling without an external mouse.  The display is unexciting TFT using integrated graphics, so don't expect any eye-popping colors, but it does the job. The lid closes securely, and closes the gaps between the keyboad/lid so that dust or debris stay out.  For word processing, e-mailing, or quick graphic/spreadsheet editing- this laptop is fantastic. 12" is too small for extended use, but it's perfect for mobility. Since there's no optical drive, you can download VLC media player and load your movies as .avi files.  There are 3 USB ports- two on the right, 1 on the left. Integrated VGA lets you hook this up to projectors for presentations or an external monitor (if you don't have the dock). There's also an infrared receiver (for remote controls), a finger print reader, dedicated volume buttons, mini-firewire, SD, ethernet, mic/headphone, Wireless A/B/G. There are external power indicator lights. My battery is showing 10 hours with the brightness turned down and 8.5 hours with the brightness on max. It has Windows XP installed, so I'm going to test it out with both Ubuntu and Windows 7 to see where it scores.  This laptop is much more powerful than a netbook, and the price beats most other ultraportables out of the water.
Excellent netbook  I had an older Acer Netbook running XP that I donated to a friend and purchased this one running Windows 7 starter.  Does everything I need it to do.  The touchpad is definitely improved over the older netbook I had.  Very happy.
Super Machine  This machine was purchased for my wife who did not enjoy using her clunkly Dell Laptop.  The machine is light and easy to carry around.  Perfect internet machine.
Great product!  I wouldn't take anything for my chromebook!
So in love  I received this for an early birthday present. I love the color (pink). The size is perfect also. The keyboard is really nice and the keys are spaced out nicely instead of crammed right next to each other like other laptops. I love the touch screen also. It took some time getting used to along with Windows 8, but once I learned it, I fell in love. There's a good amount of memory and its very fast too.
Great Machine  We use our Mac book for home school.  It makes our life much easier.  Great deal too!  Thanks so much!
LOVE this laptop! Prompt delivery, no hassle! :D
I will never go back to Windows.  Ever  This is probably the best computer I have ever owned. I love the form factor. It's durable. It's light. It's shiny and it's pretty. Don't hesitate.  Buy one for yourself. You'll see.
Beautiful, light  Beautiful, light, good quality hardware, battery life very long just as advertised. Doesn't play some video formats but I installed VLC and it was able to play all my video files.
Great choice and distributor  Working well!! Great choice and distributor.
Great computer!  Pros: Hardware is good with the i5 processor and it has a nice battery life at least for me. Trackpad isn't bad like a lot of other people say about this laptop it works fine. Light gaming is able to be done on this laptop. It idles pretty cool and on full load its still pretty cool compared to other laptop processors. Fans for this laptop are quiet and in a good position, I was able to use this on my bed without significant temperature increases although I only tested it on my sheets and not in my actual blankets. Fingerprint scanner is a nice feature. The keyboard is nice and you are able to switch the fn and ctrl keys if you don't like having them in their current position. The hard drive is nice to have it at 7200rpm since most laptops come with 5400rpm hard drives. This computer does come with Windows 8 upgrade discs so if you wanted to upgrade from Windows 7 you could.  Cons: It comes with Windows 7 installed and upgrading to Windows 8.1 can be a real pain but is able to be done. It comes with 4 discs to upgrade and it will tell you to insert a certain disc when it needs it. It took me about 4 hours to just get to Windows 8 then I had to update everything to go to Windows 8.1. This laptop does not come with any LED notifications for things like the HDD although, when the computer is on the dot in the i in thinkpad lights up. My keyboard ended up having a problem with the right arrow key but that was easy to fix and I just had to move the plastic plate under the keys with my finger. The screen also isn't the greatest but its acceptable and you just need to position it right. This computer also comes loaded with bloatware, lenovo software could probably be better. No 5ghz wifi support unfortunately so if you have an updated dual band router you can only use the 2.4ghz network.  Other notes: I bought this computer for $499 so I would try to find a similar deal. What I will be using this laptop for is college and to play a few games whenever i'm away from my main desktop, it does the job well and can do what I need. I bought another 4gb stick of memory for about $40 to add it up to 8gb.
Love the Multi-tasking I can do  I like the ease with which I can switch between the Android Tablet and the Windows 8 Touch Screen, and then the keyboard/mouse for my bookkeeping and other activities that require a lot of typing.
Super in every way!
Acer magic!  I love my Acer.  It looks fantastic, has a super long battery life, tons of storage, and it boots up so fast.
As described, thanks!
Highly Recommended  So far it is everything i expected. Fast to boot and respond, no drag during use. It is just an all round excellent laptop. Slightly overwhelmed by the size due to the fact that i use a 13" HP Spectre 360 but it is great after the mental adjustment.
Love it, but don't like Windows 10.
Working great! Meets expectations  Working great!  Meets expectations.
The only problem is that I didn't receive the touch pen in the package. There is a compartment for it in the box but it just was not there
So far I really like it. It's lightweight & super fast.
great media or work laptop  I ordered this laptop for my parents and its been a perfect media center device for them! The touch screen is precise and even though personally I am not a fan of windows 8 its perfect for my parents.  The laptop does not come with a lot of filler apps or programs like most large manufacturer laptops do which is a huge plus.  With a few tweaks I have been able to make it instant boot. Since its touch screen it works very well for bluestacks which is an android emulator.  The device is silent and runs very cool, battery life is quite lengthy.  In conclusion I would suggest this laptop for anyone who is looking for a great work or media PC. Its not a gaming laptop so don't expect much out of it for that.
Great laptop; Great price!  For the price paid, this machine really does the job.  Fast, good features & productivity, great widescreen display.  Outstanding wireless connectivity.  Only trouble I had was the fingerprint digital recognition system, since it had an installation problem (laptop doesn't recognize the digital device).  Easy burning of cd's and dvd's.  I think the cd/dvd feature where you can play music/movies without having to turn on the computer is one of the most enjoyable features of this laptop.  Perhaps the only drawback is that it doesn't come with Microsoft's Office.  If you invest in this laptop for a 2-3 year productivity period, you're getting your money's worth; for sure the laptop will last longer, assuming you treat it well.  Buy it!
Very happy with this buy  I bought my MBP on Amazon last July and up to now I am ecstatic with it's results. I have read extensively around the web for user reviews and experiences and although some negative ones made me frown I went ahead and bought one. After years of PC use and a lot of frustration because of crashes (especially with graphic design programs I use) I saved up the (chunk of ) money and bought the MBP.  I have worked with Mac's previously but that was such a long time ago that when I first turned on my MBP and saw the bright screen and colors and the power this machine has while I run heavy software, listen to music AND watch videos, it just blew me away! Apart from me being a specific user because of my line of work I think this MBP is also very suitable for less higher end user, although maybe the price could be an obstacle for buying one. Still it is worth every penny in my humble opinion.  Can't wait to see what the rumored new batch of MBP's will bring, and well hope I will not be tempted to upgrade this one myself. I'm a fan!
Does everything I need it to.  I was looking into getting a laptop and ended up getting a generic 15'' toshiba, with a little kiddo running around it was too much work to pull that clunky thing out every time I wanted to use it. I bought this after doing a good bit of research, as far as I have learned since getting it, it does everything I need it to. I mean I have my PC at home where I store all of my music and pictures, but since I have gotten my Chromebook I have yet to use my PC. All the different websites work on the chromebook. one that I wasn't sure about and couldn't find confirmation in reviews was Twitch.tv I was pleased to see that my Chromebook runs it great.
Love this Chrome book  Love this Chrome book.  Very fast.  The connection to the Internet is instantaneously.  Turning on the laptop is just a few seconds.  Love it!
Awesome product  Love it! Really easy to use touch screen is the best thing ever. I would highly recommend this product to all future laptop purchasers.
Beautiful, lightweight, amazing  I am not a technology expert and am reviewing this product specifically as a user. Also, I have never had a Sony laptop prior to receiving this one. I've used Dell, HP, and ASUS but never Sony. I'm now sorry I've never tried one of these. I don't even know where to begin with this Vaio. First, the design of it is spectacular, beautiful, and very user friendly - especially the keyboard (it's a full keyboard with the extra number pad on the right side) with its backlit keys and smoothness. When I say the keys are smooth, I mean to the touch and very sensitive. No need to apply too much pressure so it's much easier to type faster, which I love because I'm a writer and this is important for me. It's amazing how quickly the key lights come on the second you touch a key. The weight is good - sturdy but not heavy and it's also a lot slimmer than any of my other laptops. Sound quality spectacular. Graphics amazing. And the wake/up sleep modes are very quick with a 2-3 second response time. The laptop wakes up almost instantaneously and I love this. I love the simplicity of the mouse pad without all of the lines and markings delineating right and left clicks - we all know how to use this by now, no? The only thing that threw me with the mouse pad was the pinching and expanding function - much like a touch screen iphone or tablet. Took me a bit to figure that out but it's fine now and I actually like it.  I love the internal disc drive and it's quick reading ability. I was able to insert program discs and download them almost immediately. It doesn't have much of a lag time in responding.  Also includes 4 USB ports and a card slot for digital media. 750 GB of internal storage is nothing to sneeze at either even though many people are looking for a terabyte this days. I'm good with the 750.  One minor thing I had some issues with is Windows 8 and this isn't a reflection on the actual device. Windows 8 is so different than previous versions, it's rather off-putting at first. I'm dealing with it but there's just too much stuff bloating the opening screen. I would never choose about 75% of the "apps" they think are interesting or useful and I haven't quite figured out how to delete a lot of this nonsense. Really, it's completely overcrowded with useless junk. Windows 8 is a work in progress for me at this point but I think it's a bit much, overall.  The only other thing I would say is that I was surprised by how thin the power cord is. I'm not sure if this is just how they make them now but it seems like they could have given this a bit more heft. I guess it's a simple thing to replace if necessary so I opted not to remove a star for that.  Like I said earlier, I'm not an IT person just a high volume user. As a writer, my laptop is the most important tool I have and I absolutely love this one.  Recommend.
A great laptop!!!  I am writing this review from my new Asus laptop, and I love it. I ordered 2 more for my kids and the one that got here so far they adore. High speed, great graphics, runs all my programs with no lag..a great purchase!!
A Great Deal and Great Product from Amazon !!  I tried several laptops (Acer, Dell, Lenovo) before I ended up buying this one. I wanted touch screen, quad core processor, a good dedicated graphics card, SSD, and relatively lighter weight than my 2 year old HP. The Book 6 came the closest to providing most of what I wanted. My only wish was for a SSD but I can live without it for now. Best Buy offered to install one but I hate to give up the capacity of the 1T hard drive. Samsung makes good products including their Pro series 840 SSD so I may opt for it later on when prices drop I hope. Getting use to Windows 8 was a struggle but Start8 helped a whole lot. I really like this laptop. Even the internal JBL speakers sound good although I use Bose Soundlink. The keyboard is easy to see and the screen is bright providing lots of contrast. I tried a few tablets too but wasn't happy with either the small screens or their lack of horsepower. It doesn't have an optical drive but that's not a deal breaker for me since I DL most of my programs and it would have added extra weight but you can always purchase an external burner. I'm also very happy with Amazon since they delivered the laptop (well packaged) next day in the afternoon. They are amazing offering great prices and I will order from them again without hesitation. Amazon is a company you can rely on for excellent service and prices !!
Good for school.  Works for my sister's needs. She wanted something portable for school. It's good for her to do her projects, research, reports and watch instructional videos on.  I've seen her watch movies and stream stuff on.  I, however, haven't seen her use her 15" laptop in awhile.
Basic word processing and web browsing is pretty much all it can muster  I bought this product about a month ago and it does exactly what I expected it to do. Basic word processing and web browsing is pretty much all it can muster. It has a little trouble with things like twitch streams if you have too many things open at once. For someone that doesn't have a lot of tabs open, it's perfect. Also the solitaire app is rather fantastic.
The best
Excellent laptop, the touch screen really comes in hand when working with multiple documents and tabs. It's nicely complemented with Windows ten for a good price.
I bought it to replace an alienware M14x R2 (which never was very good) and I am amazed. I tested it with BF4 on Ultra settings  I am 4 days into ownership of this and I have to say I am very impressed.  I bought it to replace an alienware M14x R2 (which never was very good) and I am amazed.  I tested it with BF4 on Ultra settings and it chewed threw it with no problems, somewhere in the 80 in FPS average.  My m14 ALWAYS ran into throttling issues because it just got too hot and I'm happy to say this is 100% not a problem with the G75.  While playing BF4 for 1.5 hours it never got anywhere near 95, I cant remember what temp maxed out at but it was around 80 so definitely no problems with overheating.  I have not played aroudn with GSYNC feature yet but I will update this review in a month or 2. But so far I am very happy, it came down to buying either this or the alienware 17, but after my experience with alienware and overheating I decided to go with the ASUS and I'm glad I did
Mobile video game powerhouse  This laptop is perfect for traveling and video games.  As long as there is a power outlet available.  The price vs. specs is excellent!!
great product, fun and easy, quick and light  great little computer for traveling, taking notes in class (instead of my bigger laptop which I now use as a desktop of sorts), playing internet or browser based games, writing up documents, all very easy and accessible. Quite capable as well beyond what i originally imagined. Good buy, the new system may take a few hours to get used to, but that was no problem at all. would recommend, in fact, using it right now to right this review!
Acer AC700-1099 Chrome Book (wifi)  Received the Acer today and so far impressed with it.  Easy to use - updates done automatically when I first powered it up.  Regular chrome user on another laptop, so all my bookmarks were in place.  Fit and finish seem solid - screen clarity excellent. Went with wifi version as I plan to use my verizon 4g mifi with it on the road.  Based on my initial experience plan to use this  machine in place of my ipad because the latter's deficiences (lack of flash, usb ports) are becoming an aggravation.
Solid purchase!  Exactly as described...is new, works like new, no problems loading all the latest software and running smooth for a few weeks now. Great purchase at a good price.
I like it very much
This computer is very good price or say it's fast  This computer is very good price or say it's fast, it's a little big for the use I want you to but spectacular
... school son for his online classes and its been great.: )  bought the chromebook for my high school son for his online classes and its been great.  :)
So far its great!  This was a purchase made to replace an old desktop that was running on its last leg. So far the only thing I dislike is windows 8 but nothing having to do with the actual laptop (Windows 8 does take a little getting used to).  The specs were right where we needed (expandable to 8 GB RAM) as this will mostly used for school work and not design or entertainment. Videos play with no problems, the wireless works with no connectivity issues. I was able to get MS Office installed and works right into the look of windows 8. The apps included are ok, but very easy to uninstall. No disks sent with the computer but not a problem for us.  *as of November 27 2013 this machine is running like new. *as of June 2 2014 this machine continues to perform like new. *as of February 2015 this machine continues to perform like new. *as of November 24 2016 this machine continues to perform like new with no issues.
(so much better than DELL poor customer service and increasingly DELLdefective products  Thanks ASUS! (so much better than DELL poor customer service and increasingly DELLdefective products.  The only reason I write it here is because DELL Customer Service took the time to frustrate us during at least ten hours of phone conversations - grinding aggravation - when they sold my nephew a defective expensive laptop for which he paid over a thousand dollars of his savings (as a young boy), and almost a year past before the subject came to a resolution).  I have a few ASUS laptops now, and am very happy with the product!
Perfect for travel & comfort  Ideal for the easy chair or passenger seat. Very comfortable to use/hold. Performs flawlessly. Great display and keyboard.
Simply irresistible!  All I Can Say Is...Love Everything About  This Chromebook. Love Love It~
Excellent
This heavy-weight is fast  Very fast computer. It's hard to find a game and graphic settings to make this beast lag. The battery life is okay during regular use, but measured in minutes during heavy load gaming. It is also very very heavy for a laptop. If you want something to use on the go, keep looking. It works for me because I only care about switching rooms at home with it. Great performance like a desk-top with some versatility like a laptop. Also has a well-made, solid body construction. The red back-lit keyboard is great, and it's full-size, numpad and everything. Basically if you want a fast gaming/video computer for the home that can move between rooms, this is it!
great size screen  I've had this for almost a year, works well, great size screen. Heavier than i'd like, but other than that is great!
Excellent Choice  I needed a device that was lightweight, portable and inexpensive.  This Acer came through in every way.  I was torn between a Chromebook and a Samsung tablet.  After extensive research, I choose the Acer Chromebook and I could not be more pleased.  It does everything I need it to do.  Email,shopping, Facebook, web browsing, etc.  Keep in mind that this is not a PC and if you are looking for a device that will do everything a PC will do, you need to be looking for a PC.  But, for the price ($146.00 Best Buy open item) this cannot be beat. The boot time is non-existent (10 seconds).  The page loads are lighting fast.  Videos never buffer. At full charge I am getting 4:30 of battery use.  This device has a removable battery so purchased an additional spare for trips.  I can get a full 8 hours on two batteries.  I have converted all of my old files from my PC to a flash drive and stored them as google docs on the cloud drive for easy access and printing.  If you are looking for an inexpensive web browsing machine, I suggest you do your research first so you know exactly what you need your machine to do.
Go for it!  Ordering was simple and fast and easy. This product exceeds my expectations. The computer is fast and reliable! It was recommended to me by a friend, and I'm so glad I purchased it.
It's very good!
Good price.  Happy Wife, happy Family....My Wife loves her Lenovo G50. Thanks.
My wife loves this laptop. It was a gift.
YUH  best thing i have ordered on amazon. I researched this product for so long and works so well with my school work
Amazing computer.  This is now my official desktop computer, it does everything my previous desktop did and more. With games it runs everything on Ultra, there's no need to fanny about with shadows, clouds etc... just turn everything up! It's remarkably quiet, even after long periods of gaming. I was expecting some noise, don't get me wrong you can hear the fans whirling up but it's really nothing, due to the fantastic cooling. I would probably recommend having a gap at the back, not having you laptop pressed up against a wall for example. The looks are fantastic IMO, I'm not bothered about the chunkyness as it's what's it's packing that counts. People say it's heavy, but I couldn't care less, it doesn't travel far, there's no way I'm taking this up Mt Blanc! but for LAN parties, going over friends house (what it is built for) it's fine and you don't have any cables to worry about. I went over a mates the other day, put it down, opened it up and I was ready to go, no faffing around. ASUS high f-ing 5, you've done a sweet job! If you're looking for a gaming laptop at a decent price BOOM! you're done.  P.s. DayZ is amazing!
The best Laptop a gamer could buy!!! I'm so happy!!!  Is by far the best looking/performance laptop you'll get in the market, is beautiful, extremely fast, nice finished case, full HD display, i've tried Bioshock Infinite, Tomb Raider, Crysis 3, Dead Space 3 and Metro Last Light all them run smoothly and fluently at 1920x1080 at High-Ultra Settings, is definitively the best buy I could have done!!! This Laptop looks so powerful with the black and red mix that probably everyone I know will be jealous of it, no touchpad problems, everything works properly.  Pros: -Incredible High Resolution 1920x1080 looks amazing!!! -Powerful in all sense(Video card, Ram, Processor, HDD Capacity) -Modern and discrete(outside XD) Design. -Well configured Software -Just a Few Bloatware -Finaly useful Lenovo Software  Cons:  -Fingerprints easily on case (who cares!!) -So precious and perfect that hurts!!!  Don't hesitate BUY IT!!!
A truly powerful machine!  It's powerful. It's fast. It's even somewhat stylish, considering that it's a huge coffin with parts inside. The display is of a high quality, and the fan is quiet enough. Overall I am very satisfied.  + Very powerful and fast + Solid materials and as of now no broken parts or any deformations  - Expensive - No cd-drive
Good value
Great laptop  Too lazy to write a full-blown review up.  I am in IT, and spend a lot of time on my desktop and laptop.  This laptop was everything I expected it to be, and overall am very happy with it.  I am so confused by the negative reviews that other people have left.  This is hands down one of the best laptops I have ever used.  Perhaps there are quality control issues and some people are getting bad units, who knows... I got a perfectly functional unit, though, and I have to say I am very satisfied with it.
Worth it  Great buy! I love my refurbished MacBook Air
Great laptop or netbook if you want to call it too  I am amazed to see how fast and beautiful this laptop is. I had 3 netbooks and 2 11 inch laptops and none of them satisfied me so i sold them and the last one i just return it back to lenovo. Since i am almost 40 my eyes are starting to ask for glasses i thought the screen was going to be to small but i don't see the difference of my 2 other 13 inch laptops The keyboard light works great when typing in the dark my wife likes to watch netflix in the living room and turn the lights off i had to hook up my usb light and look for the keys of my other laptops now i am set. - the integrated video card can be changed with a press of a key and save battery with the shared video card built inn. - the size is great once you get used to the screen in a few days you will be more than happy. it weights a little more than a ultra portable 13 inch and definitely more than a netbook but the built and sturdiness of this laptop is better than anything out there in the market only Mac's have this quality of built. I use it for Internet, (chrome) and office documents they open in a blink of an eye .. i tried some of my old games like doom 3 and battlefield and they play at full quality. - the battery will last you around 6 -7 hours without gaming and around 3 hours gaming. - I carry my alienware on my alienware backpack to work and back on my bike and you don't notice the 5 or 6 pounds .. all over if you have the extra $ and you want to save a few $$ since you are not buying the latest one with the newest processor this is a good choice.
LOVE MY VAIO!!!  searched long and hard for a great laptop that would fit my needs...had this laptop since november and i wouldn't choose any other laptop... i love my vaio... no problems with slowing down, or anything in general... its perfect!
Excellent Performance  Compared to macbook pro  Pros:  1) AMD Athlon 64 x2 Dual-Core Processor TK-57 is fast with supporting architecture. 2) Streamed CBS s' 60 minutes off the internet seamlessly and in equivalent time. 3) Wireless connectivity with 802.11 b/g WLAN is adequate compared to draft n. 4) Windows Vista which came installed is very usable. 5) Laptop mouse is very stable, sensitive and sleek.  (Good redundancy features) 6) Given that the reliability of the processor is good (years out), this computer is robustly upgradable in the future:   PCMCI and Express Card slots can be used in future for Flash memory upgrade three years out from purchase date   (December 2008) to complement dwindling hard drive space. 7) Equipped with 4 USB hubs, if one hub breaks there are three more in operation. 8) Connectivity from virtually anywhere (If wireless LAN not available, an ethernet hub is built in; if ethernet not available, a modem hub connection is built in) 9) Screen picture quality has brillant, vivid colors. 10) Keyboard has a nice natural curve for typing so hands do not get tired. 11) Computer barely gets warm -- cooling fan is vey good. 12) 1/4 the price ($ 500) of mac book pro ($ 2000) and similar functionality except for battery and included hard disk space. 13) Warranty from radioshack and acer combined is 2 years compared to 1 year from apple. 14) Acers online support for drivers and downloads is very transparent, acers documentation and manuals for older and current models is better than apples, phone service is good but needs improvement, (we have an apple  G5 1.8 GHz which is quite good, apples technical phone support is also good but apples store genius personal support is inadequate and very limited with respect to battery replacement or hardware fixes).  Cons:  1) Battery life wirelessly is about 2 hours; battery life is 2.5 hours with wireless off (battery is upgradable from 6 cell to 8 cell however).  So battery life will increase to 3 h 36 min ( 2h 57 min) but compared to the the macbook pro and acer timeline series currently (11/2009) with > 6 hours, the battery life could be better but this would consume spatial volume within the computer that I see can be better utlilized in the future for Flash (solid State memory upgrades) in the PCMCIA and Express card slots without having to carry around a portable drive (that may be faster for retrieval) but cumbersome to carry. 2) Hard disk drive included is 120 GB which is ok but not as good as 250 or 320 GB. 3) No bluetooth included but installation of a wired internal bluetooth chip is quite doable for $20 off ebay or using one of the 4 USB hubs is also doable for the same cost.  I really do not see why a CD drive is constantly being included in this and future laptops as it just takes up potential valuable hard drive space, Flash memory space or Battery space.  I anticipate flash memory will eventually displace CD infrastructure when it becomes more affordable for software and movie vendors.  Considering purchase of acer timeline 15.6" in addition for newspaper browsing family member just for the extra battery life per charge.  However I look to my acer extensa 5420-5038 more as a long term investment for the AMD processor life span and for the acer extensa 5420-5038 to be more expandable and upgradable in terms of memory --we will see, but so far so good.  Update as of Oct 22, 2012 (3 years and 10 months later) -- I originally gave this computer four stars to be conservative after owning the computer for 11 months.  After having owned this computer for 3 years and 10 months, this computer has been reliable and functions very well with the vista operating system.  If you want a workhorse computer that is reliable, then the acer extensa 5420-5038 computer is a good investment.
This is a very basic system.....but very fast and responsive......excellent computer. Tthere are plenty of apps and other free programs to down load to make this excellent computer even more personall. If you buy this system.....u won't be unhappy.
Nice
perfect  It's really fantastic to own such a great notebook in this price
Great product for cheap price   I have used this for one month and every went wonderfully  It does have some heat related problems while playing games but if you put it on a fan, everything will be fine
Excellent computer with DVD player!  Excellent computer, easy to navigate through windows.  Back lit keyboard is an awesome feature, great sound speakers.  Boots up quickly.  Able to run mtiple tabs at once.
Nice Laptop, fast, great sound  I like this laptop overall. I am especially happy with the sound, color, look, the light weight and the battery time. I use it daily, nothing slows it down.  The 14" screen is plenty big and is much lighter than a 15+".  I own an old 14" Acer Aspire laptop and liked that as well therefore decided to stay with Acer.  The biggest change is the sound, a big improvement. The cobalt blue exterior is very nice. *I am adding this line a year after my first review.-  I still am extrememly happy with this laptop.  No problems, light easy to handle, does it all.
Great performance, excellent value  I purchased this laptop as a replacement to my HP G71, 17" Laptop after my son kicked the display and broke it by accident. My options were to get my 3 yr. old G71 display replaced or spend $100 more and get a new laptop.  I knew I wanted something a little smaller because 17" just felt too big. After a week of looking I decided that this 15.6" ASUS X53Z-RS61 was exactly what I needed.  First, the quality of ASUS is 2nd to none. I've built every desktop computer I have owned since 1991, and ASUS motherboards are unmatched in quality. I'm happy to say, their laptops are equally impressive of the quality I have come to expect.  With 6 GB of RAM and a 750 GB Hard Drive storage along with a quad core processor, This X53Z is priced at least $70 less than the competitions equal. I use mine for college work and basic home use, so I wasn't looking for a good game playing unit.  It was quick to setup and get started, but of course you need to remove all the extras that come preloaded and you don't need. I was connected to my home wireless network and online in minutes. Web pages load fast and smoothly and multitasking is not a problem. The "IceCool" feature keeps your hands cool even after hours.  Battery life is not bad at about 3.5 to 4 hours. Overall, this X53Z-RS61 performs even better than I expected.  If you want quality and performance at a great price, look no further...
works very quickly easy to maintain and operate! Jusyt enough for one person usage.
Works good and is light and small  Works good and is light and small, fits easily in suit case, great for traveling. Hard to find a 12v auto charger to fit.
Excellent Thank You A++++++
I am a web designer and I absolutely love this laptop  I am a web designer and I absolutely love this laptop! Beautiful - Fast - Fun! It is perfect. The display is the best I have seen. Move over Mac Book Pro - I found something better.
buy it  fast, sleek, I love the touch screen.  no complaints.
Excelent product
Awesome for students or as a second PC  I'm Lora's son, I go to a top 10 business school and let me tell you....they give us elite books and (last year the hp elite book) and this year they are moving to MacBook airs or the carbon x1. I wouldn't trade the old elite books with a chrome book for a mac book air. A chrome Book let's you have something as light and thin as a mac book air, do 90% of what you would do on a mac book air and let's you Remote Desktop to your high power PC which you can leave running with the screen closed like a computer tower. You can research for projects, check email, word process, take amazing notes using "one note" (download that immediately) and more. Best purchase ever. Never going to regret it
Lightweight and very fast great start up computer
Good laptop  Best laptop i ever got. Fast, and fast, and very fast. I love it. I did not know my old laptop is that slow until now.
Great Laptop  Great product
good
Read all the reviews - they are spot on  I'm rating this computer five stars as it's a great computer for the price (i.e. the cheapest windows pc that you can find). I read through all of the reviews on this site, as well as others, and found that the reviews were pretty spot on. I definitely recommend checking out other reviews before buying to see if this is the right computer for you. My background: I'm actually a mac girl, but I needed a pc computer to run a particular type of software for grad school. I had the choice of sinking money into my '08 mac to fix a broken ram port, set up bootcamp, and buy windows for mac; OR just buying the cheapest windows pc I could find. I chose the latter as it was actually the cheaper (and faster) option and, so far, I'm happy with this computer's speed in running the software.  Small details of note: *SUPER light plastic material - it's crazy how light this computer is. *Track pad is much more responsive than my previous computer and it took me a little while to get used to it. I actually thought that it wasn't tracking as it should due to a malfunction, but then realized that I was being too heavy-handed. *Windows 8 is pretty annoying on a computer that doesn't have a touchscreen, but you can customize it back to the regular desktop. To add to the track pad comment above, the track pad does allow you to expand/minimize with two fingers the way that you would on a touchscreen. Am currently undecided as to whether or not I find this feature useful. *Shorter power cord than I was expecting (not a dealbreaker by any means, but slightly annoying) *Purchased it for a total of $308 w/shipping and tax. I saw it for about $250 a few weeks previous, which I obviously would have preferred, but I'm still pretty happy with the price.
Amazing value for a mid-range gaming laptop.  Amazing value for a mid-range gaming laptop. Mine came with a Toshiba m. 2 ssd and HYNIX DDR3L ram (cl11). It is vey well made (considering the price), the monitor (matte, IPS, FHD) has pleasant colours and good viewing angles, the Speakers are also very good for a laptop and the combination of CPU + GPU give plenty of proccessing power for CPU intensive tasks and 1080p gaming. I personally don't have a problem with the Touchpad and keyboard (I have read of complaints about these two). It is largely a matter of personal preference I guess.... I would like it to have a USB Type-C port and a DP or VGA port but I am willing to forgive that because of the low price.
This Zenbook has everything I want in a gaming laptop.  I was looking for a laptop I can play Bilzz Ent. game while I travel for work. This is light, smooth, discrete, and most importantly, powerful. I didn't quite like the amount of glare from the screen, but I purchased a cheap screen protector to solve that problem.
perfect
nice laptop  I have to admit I do not use it every single day, but it has performed flawlessly for a year. Still getting 6 hours of battery life with original battery. It's fast and reliable. I am very happy with the purchase. And looks very well, gets attention.
Pretty happy with my purchase  Laptop was in great condition. Packaged very well. Seller is responsive to messages/email. Overall I am pretty happy with my purchase. Great price too. I will not hesitate to buy from Techno Technology again.  Just an FYI, when the T420s has atleast 8gb of RAM and a solid state drive, it's performance is outstanding!
Great Laptop  I will say that this is a solid laptop, reasonable weight and decent battery life. I typically get 4 hours on battery. I would say this is a good value for money.  This is my home laptop in addition to a Dell from my work and a Macbook Air 11" which i use for my personal travels.
great laptop  First of all it has 1005m 1.9ghz processor.  Second of all it has 1 stick of ram.  It means you can bump up the performance for $25 bucks with another stick of 4gb ram. It has sharp acreen,  great colors, very decent speakers,  soft and responsive keyboard.  Also comfortable trackpad with engraving to feel the scroll.  You can not go wrong with this machine for the price, just ignore word Celeron,  CPU is pretty fast.
good deal  nice-just as promised
fantastic  This is so fantastic, its refurbished but I think it new never used, I use it as a desktop computer and its way better then my real desktop computer which is a 3GHz processor. if it has any negatives its the battery charge only lasts about 4 hours, however I keep it pluged in as I use it as a desktop. purchasing a 9 cell battery for it at around $40 will salve that problem. it comes with the standard 6 cell. Ive been using this fantastic computer for about 2 months now.
Honest Reviewer  HONEST REVIEWWW! I Absolutely Love This Computer, The Color Just Stands, Wifi Is On Point. I Just Hate That I Cant Really Download Adobe Flash Player, Or Microsoft Word!
Love this macbook  Love this macbook, it's very light and thin easy for me to carry it around school. Very happy with performance of this macbook, everything loads/opens instantly.
My daughter uses it more how ever lol  Love it !!!
amazing user now
This is the first chromebook I've ever used and I love it!  I'm just a mom/grandma who uses her laptop for stay at home mom/grandma kind of things . I share it with a toddler and a six year old. This is the first chromebook I've ever used and I love it!! Highly recommend trying the chromebook to anyone like me who never uses a computer for offline stuff anyway. All of my other windows based laptops were glitchy even when new ,even the 800 dollar one. This little chromebook is so fast and so easy. Adoring it! If you are on the fence about trying one, I would say just try it , it's less than 200 dollars and I think you are going to like it. Love the fact that it doesn't need antivirus !!! OMG! Amazing.
I love it so much.  I ordered this because I wanted a 'vintage' type laptop that would still work and wasn't expensive as hell. So I went ahead and ordered this from Amazon. It is the most perfect product ever and I wouldn't have gotten any other laptop. It came in perfect condition and perfectly clean and almost new. With such a nice pricing range, I don't know why anyone would buy anything else! This review is being typed in by this product, which I love so much.
I bought this laptop for my mom, thinking it was just like the white acer chromebook that I bought on Amazon a few years ago. It's actually even better than my chromebook. The screen is crystal clear. The chromebook is fast and extremely easy to use, especially for my 66-year old mom who's not always quick to learn new technology.
I bought this as a gift for my 13 year old son. It serves its purpose for school assignments
The best, like new! excellent options loaded.
Awesome! I love it  Awesome!  I love it.  I used PCs for years and now I can't even imagine myself straying from a Mac.  I love the size, weight and the beautiful screen.  The speakers aren't amazing, but I'll live.  I love, love, love my new Mac!  Thank you to Amazon for a great price and getting it to me on time as promised.
I love this laptop.  This laptop is great.  The only concern I had/have is that there's no Microsoft Office.  Instead, OpenOffice is recommended (a free office suite) which includes Writer (for Word); Calc (for Excel); Impress (for PowerPoint); and Draw (no equivalent in Microsoft).  It also has full database capability (similar to Access).  I'm very happy with these alternatives but I won't find out until school is back in session whether or not this software plays well with others. According to the write-ups, Open Office is compatible with Microsoft Office.  We shall see.
Best alternative to a tablet, ever ...  I do most of my power computing via remote desktop or while at work.  For home, i wanted something light with a long battery life.  The Chromebook is perfect for this "lightweight" need of mine!  It is preferable to me over an iPad or tablet, since it has a keyboard (I write a lot).  Have had no problems and am very happy with my purchase.
good
Would buy again in a heartbeat  NOT a computer expert by any stretch of the imagination. Please keep that in mind as you read this review:  After some research I decided to go with this windows based laptop.  My criteria: I needed at least 8 GB of RAM, 500 GB of storage, a computer less than 3 years old, a fairly large screen that was a PC (for work programs) that was priced under $1000.  In addition in this model I got a touch-screen (not a tablet though, it IS a laptop), Windows 8 (although I wasn't sure if that was a bonus or not. time will tell.), great resolution and decent battery life, backlit keyboard, nice responsive keys- I hate smooshy laptop keyboards.  Basically, I needed a computer that would last me at least 3-4 years for work without becoming obsolete.  This fits the bill nicely. Basically plug in and use. I did have to figure out how to set up a Microsoft account, how to install/download my previously purchased Office 2010 and download a few apps (kindle, Netflix) etc.  Kind of irritating that my smartphone uses Google play, my tablet is a kindle so uses Amazon store and now my laptop uses Windows store. But that's my fault for not having consistency. Still irritating though.  NO BLOATWARE WHATSOEVER!!! Remember the days (10+ years ago) when you would spend h-o-u-r-s uninstalling useless programs off of your new computer? Those days are GONE!! I suppose many people know that but I didn't. My desktop computer is 5+ years old.  The only stumbling block I have at this very moment is trying to get my old HP printer to become wireless, but come to find out that a wireless print server is just as expensive as a new printer!! Since my partner has a laptop as well, I'm thinking a new printer may be for us. We'll keep the old setup for the kids.  The computer itself is wonderful, but I'm having to get used to the Windows 8 and it's just taken me a few moments (and a google search or two! sorry Bing ) for some silly things like zooming, how do I bring up programs (There's no START menu in the lower left corner anymore!) and the like. It's not bad though.  Thinking I might buy a bluetooth mouse though. I'm old enough where track pads annoy me.  Computer doesn't run hot and it's quiet. super quiet. Again, my current computer is old so that may be standard now, I don't know but it's nice.   I get some software loaded into it next week for work and that will be the true test. I'll update them on how it is.
Good
everything is great, just a little cramped on the full size keyboard
Great Media Friendly Laptop  This laptop is awesome. A week prior to this, i bought a Toshiba with an a4 processor. I was in the market after my daughter broke my dell inspiron. Her school program is based online; i searched chromebooks and lower end toshibas. Out the door price on the toshiba was certainly cheaper by a couple hundred bucks in comparison to the vaio. However, the toshiba didn't make it 3 days in my household before i was executing a return. On the Toshiba, the mouse froze several times, it was only for a couple minutes at a time, but when you're trying to get something done, it felt like hours; Netflix also took forever and sound quality was mediocre. It performed like a $300 laptop. That being said, if you're able to spend a couple hundred more, grab the lower end Sony vaio. For me, it's definitely worth it. The sound and display quality are suberp and it's able to process faster. It had no problem with Netflix and it plays music even when you close the lid. The light up keyboard is fun too. Great quality and still within a tight budget.... On the flip side, the one minor annoyance (with the sony vaio) and i will say minor because i prefer the annoyance over the consistent freeze-ups of the toshiba: the vaio does lose internet connection on a scale of...i'd say infrequently after a week's use. It's maybe done it 3 times of the 10-15 uses. My wifi signal will indicate "limited" even when i'm right in front of my signal. At that point, it's been a simple disconnect (from the laptop wifi), count to 10 and reconnect. It's worked all 3 times so far, but it does need that 10ish second gap. Not a deal-breaker for me, but i could see how it might annoy others on varying degrees, so heads-up.
So much better than I expected.  Very easy to use and well made
Nice laptop for the price!  Oh, and it has a webcam...
good
Great buy  Very happy with this purchase. I had never used a Chromebook before this; I came across it because the MacBook Pro I previously owned broke, so I was forced to find a replacement quickly. I was iffy about the fact that there is essentially no operating system, just a browser. But since I really only use computers for the Internet and taking notes for school, I decided to give it a try. No complaints as of yet! You can find an app for just about anything. Evernote and Google Docs are my note-taking go-tos, and I use Google Drive all the time to store necessary documents. Would not recommend this to anyone who enjoys PC gaming (you cannot install any software) or who uses lots of standalone programs such as Photoshop. You will likely pull your hair out trying to find online alternatives for such things. If you're a student or someone who simply needs access to an Internet browser and simple word formatting programs, this works great!
Best Bang for your Buck Ultrabook  This laptop is just simply amazing for the price. Let me simplify the specs for you. A 13.3 inch 1080p Matte Display with a Core M processor, 8GB of Ram and 256 GB of Solid State. From the get go this laptop is stunning and all I can think is of the deal that this thing is. This is going to be an in depth review as I've had this ultrabook for over 6 months.  It gives off a strong first impression, as soon as I turned it on it boots up within seconds. I've never really had an ultrabook with a solid state drive so I heard it boots up fast but it just really blew me away. Everything is extremely snappy and it has taken everything I have thrown at it. I have thrown heavy games, photo editing, movies, and even music production and this thing just does not slow down. Big surprise to me since it has just a Core M but it has lived up to the challenge and more.  Another thing you will notice as soon as you get it is the thinness and lightness of the unit. It is among the thinnest and lightest of any ultrabook out there and it shows. I have been able to one hand it to show friends many things and it does not break my arm at all. It comes at just under .5 inch thin and around 2.5lbs.  The 8GB of RAM is plenty enough to do almost any task, as I've said, I have thrown many things at it and has yet to fail. I have not tested heavy video editing, then again you shouldn't really be looking at this if you want to do that. The 256 GB of Solid State is also plenty of space to use for the common person. Unless you load tons of videos or games onto your laptop then I wouldn't worry about space.  Another great thing about this laptop is the ports. It has 3 USB ports, a Micro HDMI port, Headphone jack, and an SD Card port. All 3 USB ports are SuperSpeed 3.0 ports meaning they transfer information even faster and charge your phone as a regular wall outlet would.  Now everything has its downside. This ultrabook does have many but still has some: -No optical disc drive. This is a problem with any ultrabook. If you still use CDs then steer away from any ultrabooks. -No backlit keyboard. It's kind of a bummer, but makes sense since this is a budget minded unit. - Premium feel. While the build is good, it isn't great. Again, this is not one of those expensive ultrabooks so still makes sense.  Overall this is a great ultrabook. The thing I cannot stress enough is the great value you get for this laptop. Sure it isn't really the best at anything amongst its class, but is by far the better deal. I am a daily user on this as a student and would recommend this for anyone. Thanks for reading and I hope you find the laptop you are looking for.
Excellent performance.  I initially upgraded with an SSD and larger battery.  Worked fine until I ran over it with my SUV.  After that event I  replaced the broken LCD screen and battery pack and the computer started right up again where it had left off.  Apparently ASUS makes them tough.
Beautiful  Bought for my husband..He plays quite a few games. He loves it..I want one too. Great sound, graphics are amazing. Fast and smooth.
Great computer  Great computer.  Really really fast and loads everything quickly.  The screen is amazing and is great for editing pictures.
Great machine  Great machine. Best bang for the buck. Size is perfect for backpack/school pack. Screen and keyboard size - excellent, not too small. Bright screen. No sweat battery life. Should come with Vista Home Premium, less bloat ware. Rating is actually 4.9
very good
Product worked as expected  daughter loves the computer, plays animal jam nonn stop and does her homework with ease.  Touch screen works great, good resolution, affordable.
amazing  I had a compaq which broke and then i decided to splurge on something really nice.  I have no complaints so far and this is the first mac ive ever owned.  I found the transition extremely easy.  Everything on the mac is easier and faster, simply amazing.
Excellent Machine  I bought this laptop for graduate school.  As someone who will be working full-time and going to school it was important that I have something light and portable, yet capable.  So far this computer has exceeded my expectations.  I have downloaded software while simultaneously working apps and browsing multiple tabs online and have not lost any speed.  I have yet to see how it holds up to light gaming, but even if this computer disappoints in that regard, it's still great for my purposes. The computer is quiet (fanless), and FAST.  Shutdown to internet browsing is 20 seconds and that includes typing in a password (once you go SSD you'll never go back).  My only complaints are similar to others: the track pad is loud, no back lighting on the keyboard, and the machine shows finger smudges pretty easily.  The speakers also leave something to be desired, but I'm primarily on headphones so it's no big deal for me.  It also comes with Windows 8.1, which is not ideal, but upon initial boot up there is a prompt to reserve your free system update on 7/29/15 when Windows 10 is released.  The last thing I will say is to get the Signature Edition that comes free of bloatware/trialware.  You can't put a price on starting with a clean computer (well you can, but the price is right here).
Awesome Linux Laptop  Makes a perfect Linux laptop with a Linux distribution from www.distroshare.com.
Had to return  The cursor did not work. Google customer service and I could not fix. Ok, things happen. What is good to note is that that Amazon made the return process so easy it was amazing. I printed the label and left the package outside before I went to work the next morning. They had already ordered the replacement and I had it in two days. BTW, the new one I received works fine.
Great seller, awesome laptop  I love the laptop.  Keypad is great.  I have downloaded what I needed to have on my laptop without any problems.  The only problem I have had was with Windows 8;however, having to have windows 8 as Microsoft will no longer support the programs I needed to use I had no other choice.  Would recommend Lenovo anytime.  Seller was a great  communicator.
Good bang for your buck  I love everything about this laptop. The Windows 8 takes a little patience getting used to but besides that. Its excellent!
Value for money  Great for note taking. Decent size. Value for money. Performance is great so far
Excelent
Awesome machine for the price!  Initally attracted to the Core i5 processor and the 4 gigs of RAM, I was pleasantly surprised with the discounted price at the time.  As a somewhat serious computer user - student, small business owner, amateur photographer - I needed something that was affordable, relatively fast, and superbly reliable.  Acer has absolutely come through with this one.  The only real complaint I have is that the track pad lacks clear definition, so accidental cursor misplacement is common during the acquaintance phase of owning a new machine.  Otherwise, I have no complaints.  Intel has done an excellent job with their Core series processors, and Acer's fabrication leaves little to complain about.  An excellent (and hearty - it has stood up to quite a bit of abuse already in the short time I've owned it,) laptop, suitable for just about anyone who is looking for quality within a budget.  Easy to use out of the box, but also easily customizable for those of us who are a bit more discriminating in how we want things to work.
Very happy with my new machine!
It is a Great computer, with ultra fast wifi  It is a Great computer, with ultra fast wifi, excellent HD screen and powerful memory ram 12, 1 Tb hard drive. Is enough for me because I require it for heavy programs: Matlab, Visio, autocad.
The best shopping experience...everything was perfect  Amazing product and great customer service!
after three years  I have had this computer for three years now and it still runs like new. This is a very durable all purpose computer. For the price that it is listed at you can not go wrong I promise you. After three years all of the components work the same. I know two people with newer computers than me that are much slower than mine is. It is very simple looking, but very well made. I also play large games on this computer, and with a good game booster it runs them without problems. This is my altime favorite laptop!
awesome acer product  Great laptop and very quick operating! Advanced and the touch of the keyboard is so nice.this was a great buy. Acer does it again! Very reliable!
very nice
Great workhorse  I have owned several Dell laptops, all bought used/refurbished, and have not been disappointed once. I use them to run Linux systems, sometimes dual-booting two different Linux OS flavors and sometimes even dual-booting Linux and Windows. I don't do gaming, so I cannot address the suitability of these machines for that type of application, but for what I do: word-processing, spreadsheets, website design, image editing, email, and hobby-level programming, these work very satisfactorily.
Awesome laptop for the money  I did a lot of research on laptops before deciding on this one, I was looking for one with a blu ray player in it so I could watch all my newer movies, but this comes with so much more, 750gb of disk space, 3.0 USB ports and a 8g processor. The picture looks great too, runs fast and cool like another reviewer mentioned, for the price, you can't beat this laptop, I would've probably paid 1000 for this...  I guess you can say I'm very satisfied with this laptop, and I'm sure you would be too...
excelente
Very good laptop, very silent  Very good laptop, very silent, and even under load it is not too loud. Very compact and the screen is wonderful. The overall construction feels very sturdy. I recommend the amplifier to either run the games at max settings in the WQXGA Screen or simply an external monitor.
Excellent buy. Beautiful screen  Excellent buy. Beautiful screen, so far no problems. I am quite pleased with the purchase and the great price. Thank you Seller, Gina Silva
Chrome book Is awesome  My 14 year old loves it!
Love it!!!!!!!!!!!
Awesome product. Liked it very much  Awesome product. Liked it very much
LOVE This!  LOVE LOVE LOVE it! It works perfectly! We have 3, my 2 sons (13 & 11) each have their own, which is perfect, they use it for school work. It's fast processing, downloading is really fast.
Awesome Laptop. Was everything we hoped for and more.
Great Buy  Great Computer - super fast and quiet... a big change from my old Samsung.  Also great customer service interaction with the folks from Eluktronics was top notch as well!
Nice product  Its perfect as good as new
It is easy to program and use  I purchased this for my Grandson and he loves it. It is easy to program and use. In fact, he recommended this item for my granddaughter who is starting college very soon. Received the item very quickly and it was nicely sent. I would definitely recommend to anyone.
Great lap top  The size was great for the price. The lightness of it is great . The speed is more than what I thought it would be
Very good
My son is really happy ... Met expectations...!!!
My Perspective  This is my first ever laptop that I've owned and overall I love the whole feel of it.  I am using this more than my gaming PC just for the ease of use of it.  I love the solid feel of the body of the laptop and the keyboard with the rounded edge keys that are nicely spaced apart really make a difference.  I've done all my typing on this since I got it which is the main purpose I wanted it for.  The touch screen is very responsive and though I used it far more often at first than I do currently (due to always have to clear off the smudges) I still use it from time to time when I am feeling lazy or that it feels to be the better method of use.  Yeah the battery life is a bit on the short end of the stick but I don't plan on using it anywhere too far from a power source so it's no problem at all for me.  After playing around with it some I would say that the other recommendations for upgrading the RAM would definitely come in handy for those higher demand jobs.  For general usage I would say you could skip it easily without any issues.  So far I am now a fan of Dell's laptops at least!
Awesome laptop.
Great product and fast shipment!  The product was out of stock at first and Amazon gave you a choice to place your order now and then they would send it to you when they came back in stock.  I was a little unsure because I thought it was going to take forever to get it, but I bought it anyways.  To my surprise it took a little less than a week for the product to come in, and I received the Acer in 3 days max. It's a great computer for what I use it for and I definitely recommend it.
Excellent, Easy, Efficient EEE  I wanted this for travel and at work to keep beside my work computer for personal use.  My techno geek husband so wanted me to get a laptop, that when I finally ordered it, that nite as I fell off to sleep I heard him say..."it's not too late, you can cancel that order and get a laptop.." whispered in my ear!!!!  For those of you, (perhaps mostly women, I'm not sure) who have always wondered at the amazing number of programs on your computer that bog it down and don't get used, this has just the right programs.  I highly recommend it :-)
Fast and sexy  The 17-inch 2011 MBP has a hefty price tag, but for those looking to replace a desktop or in dire need of a true mobile workstation -- look no further.  The performance beats my BTO 2.93 GHZ i7 27-inch iMac (late 2010), and the high resolution 1920x1200 display is worth the added cost over the high-end 15-inch MBP.  Prior to biting the bullet I was on the fence over whether to get the entry-level or high-end 15-inch model.  Unfortunately unless you order from Apple there's no way to add the high-res display (1680x1050).  If you are a Final Cut Pro user, this could be important since Color requires the high-res display.  Of course you could connect to an auxiliary monitor, but that's another $999 (27-inch Cinema display) -- or $399 for a 24-inch IPS HP display.  At the end of the day the difference in price between the 15-inch high-end and the 17-inch was just over $200 (1959 vs 2163 open box 'like-new' Warehouse Deals).  In everyday use I would have no problem using the 1440x900 resolution of the 15-inch model, but I really wanted the hig-res option.  Ordering the 15-inch top model + high-res option from Apple with a student discount still ended up being more expensive than the 17-inch MBP through Amazon.  I was hesitant about the size and weight.  In the store I felt like the 17-inch model would be overkill, but now that I've handled and transported it for a few days I'm not bothered by the size.  With that being said, if Amazon was to offer the high-res 15 inch model I would probably opt for that instead since there's little benefit of going from 1680x1050 to 1920x1200 in terms of application compatibility.  On a side note, if you are considering a Warehouse deal via Amazon, I highly recommend it -- just make sure you choose the 'like-new' model.  These things are sealed, brand new with just some minor cosmetic damage to the retail packaging (or possibly none). $2163.99 for the 17-inch MBP is a deal.
Good Deal  Provided the laptop configuration, this is a really good deal. I give it a 5 star. Windows 7, LED screen and almost 5 GB RAM, a laptop worth spending your money on.
lightweight dream!  this little guy was bought out of love of travel and small things. after having terrible luck with laptops traveling, we needed something reliable to track bills, payments, bank accounts and emails with. this does the trick! light weight, easy access, no frills. i can check facebook but cant play games, can check email but cant watch youtube. basically like a big fancy tablet, which is good cause my husband has trouble seeing the small text on the phone and on tablets.
I am a Professional Photographer and love editing mobile with this laptop.
A good buy  I bought this laptop as a gift for my son.  He loves the size and weight, making it extremely portable.  It starts up quickly, and is zippy enough.  We purchased extra ram as another reviewer suggested, but found the tiny screw in the back a challenge to remove. He is planning on using it for general web surfing and word documents.  The keyboard is small but adequate. Since he has only had it one week, I can't comment on battery life, but so far, it meets his needs. We are happy with the purchase and have experienced no problems so far.
cool  After having my previous HP broken, I bought this beauty and im happy so far. HP is great
For my daughter. She loves it so far. Works great for surfing and playing games (not too intensive on the system).
Samsung Chromebook  I absolutely love, love this computer. I wanted something very light and portable to use for internet surfing and this fills the bill. It is very well made and the keyboard is comfortable to use. It runs very fast for such a small pc; I can't believe how fast it boots up. Also, the battery is great, and stays charged for a long time. It is the best $249 I've spent in a long time.
Lightweight and powerful  This compuer has all of the necessary hardware and performs exceptionally well.  I purchased this based on the size and weight asd I travel extensively both domestically and overseas.  I also activated the internal Cingular card and it is working great!  I highly recommend this computer for those who want desktop performance in a small and lightweight computer.
I bought this for school and it works great.
Love my gateway laptop  Love my gateway laptop. Easy to use.  I have a bad back, and I can sit in my recliner and be in comfort while using my laptop.
Love it
Really good laptop, going to use this for school (commuting)  Really good laptop, going to use this for school (commuting). The laptop is really light, and the charger is small and also light!  Would not recommend this as your only laptop/computer, but it's great for commuter students.
Great!  Body is in great condition on the Macbook and its a fast computer! Great for price!!!
Dell I15RM Laptop  This Dell Laptop was a christmas gift for my grandson. He wanted a Blue laptop but the awesome price for the Dell i15RM in Diamond Black came with switch lid option. It came with the 10 key pad which is rare in most laptops. And i purchased the laptop, a wireless mouse the Blue switch lid  and a carry case all under five hundred dollars. What a great deal!!! My grandson couldn't believe he got what he wanted and more!! I would highly recommend this laptop.
EXCELENTE  EXCELENTE
best item bought on amazon so far. The laptop is exactly as i saw it. Excellent product
Good value  Basic computer still works great after 3 years
Great Computer, its is a big computer but it is quite light, works great
Best Value out there.  Best Value for an everyday laptop.  It boots up super quick and shuts down quickly.  Crystal clear screen & descent sound for a laptop.  Very pleased.  You will not find an I5 intel. solid state laptop cheaper anywhere.  Feels solid and well made.  Buy it!
Perfect for my nephew  Is a perfect laptop small confy. Also the dell warranty. She uses for text procesor webmail social networks and some pics editing software
from 2 stars to 5 stars  i changed my mind on how disappointed i was on this product. i guess when its opened out of the box it runs slow for a few days, like as if you gotta break-in a car engine. the computer runs great and it was an unusually low price as well. im very happy
Love it!  I have never owned a small computer before, but I bought it to use for a power point presentation. I wanted portability and functionality. I got both. Very pleased!
Worked Perfect and couldn't even tell it was used.... Thanks
Best budget touchscreen Internet device  The only disappointment with this Chromebook is it is heavier and the weight is not as nicely distributed as the Samsung XE303C12. Every other aspect especially speed and battery life are better than the Samsung. The touchscreen is very nice to use as well and is the reason I bought this instead of the other Chromebooks.
A good value!  Very good computer. As advertised and I recommend!
excellent  this laptop is excellent. very fast. on first startup , it did not contain a lot of bloatware. it has usb3 . runs cool for hours. i wish they had an option with SSD. minor cons include short battery time and very low webcam resolution.
But it's also pretty damn nice  Yes, it's expensive. But it's also pretty damn nice. The trackpad is in a position, and good enough to actually make gaming passable without a dedicated mouse. You'll still want one, but it serves in a punch and the alternate modes keep it useful even if you're not using it as a trackpad.
Not a bad little laptop!  My husband and I did a LOT of shopping around before buying a laptop and this model kept popping up in our most-likely choices. I agree with the previous review that it doesn't open with one hand and I thought it would be an annoyance, but with having three kids ages 7 and under, my youngest is not able to access my computer and that makes it a nice benefit to me. Since I leave my computer on most of the day, battery life was not an issue to me as I leave it plugged in most of the time, but I've noticed that it will last approx 1hr 30 mins or so. It didn't come loaded with a bunch of useless programs (just 2-3 advertisement type icons) and has a very helpful 'help center'  I've enjoyed it so far, as a basic user (I'm very point/click and don't know anything about programming) and would recommend this to friends and family.
Good device, well built.  It works for what I need it. Solid specs (high end i7 quad core with hyperthreading, 16 GB of DDR4, 512 GB of storage space? Yes. Oh yes). Beautiful 4K screen (do NOT attempt to play any game above 1080p, the 2 GB buffer and the video graphics chip will not cut it at 4K or 2K). Long lasting battery and reasonable weight given the aluminum build. Recommended for power users on the go.
excellent, safely  excellent, safely , thanks
Very nice conputer.
GREAT portable computer for school, work, or travel  Love it. Light as a feather. Easy to handle. Connects to wireless internet easily and has good battery life. Plenty of memory to store simple files as you work on them, but plan to use external hard drives for long-term. Plays video and such without interruptions. Fits easily in my backpack for school. Comes loaded with Microsoft Office for a year, and then you renew your subscription (I think it was about $60?). Great little laptop for the price.
Excellent Laptop.  Great Quality for the prices
Simple solution for simple needs  I needed something to simply surf the web, and play music. I'm an IT professional and I wanted a tool not another system I need to devote time to. This seems to fit the bill nicely. Quick boot, time plenty of power no problems whatsoever in the past two months.
Working well
Durable, reliable, and hot  I'm not going to lie, this laptop is durable and will last you through the 4+ years of school. The HP support for the business class laptops is next level. They'll send a technician to your place to fix your laptop for you (if it's under warranty). A few things that may be considered a downside is that the computer gets really hot, the keyboard is susceptible to breaking, and there is some power surge issues, but other than that it's a great buy. TBH it's fun to see your classmates cycle through laptops and know this one will keep on chuggin'. Oh and it has a Num Pad which I've appreciated countless times.
Amazing  Bought this as a replacement for a Qosmio X505 since that one was too big for me, i use the laptop for games mostly, and i can say that theres no game that this computer cant handle, graphics are stunning, and the laptop never get hot with the cooling system. Is just a great computer. Only con i found (and maybe because i don't yet get used to it) is the sensitivity of the touchpad. Any other way this laptop rocks.
Awesome laptop for lightweight/moderate usage  Great laptop, bought it for my girlfriend for work, she does some office and spreadsheet work and light work related programs, web browsing and such.  The laptop is fast and works great, with an i5 and an SSD it's quick and responsive The build quality is phenomenal, feels sturdy and the hinges feel solid, it's lightweight so you can carry it around easily. Battery life is acceptable, really depends on the brightness level you use. The screen looks very nice, although for streaming and watching netflix we usually hook it up to the TV via HDMI  We're very happy with this purchase and the product quality on this laptop
An Orgasmic Experience  Despite the huge load I put in this thing, it takes it like a champ. McAfee ensures I never get any viruses, no matter how dirty the site I visit and Windows 8 easily allows me to double click my mouse all night, over and over again, until my fingers go numb.  Double entendres aside, it's a great computer. I'm using it as a desktop replacement. I mainly run Office and stream videos, as well as do some occasional Photoshop work, but it can handle it all, for an entire 12 hour workday. Windows 8 was a bit of a learning curve, but I'm getting it. I can't speak to the touchiness of the track-pad or keyboard, as I bought this with a wireless mouse and keyboard from Logitech. I'm a hard typer and I need something that can take a beating. I doubt this keyboard and trackpad could, so keep that in mind if you're a bit rough with your equipment like me. God knows I like it rough. ;)  All in all, I've very happy with this purchase, especially for the price.  Of course, should this thing piss out on me, I'll be back faster than an angry ex can say "palimony payments" to update this review, but for now, I've had a very happy ending.
Very pleased with this notebook!  This little notebook computer has been wonderful to take to work.  I take it every day so I can check my email because we can't use our work computers for personal use.  I have had no problems with it and would highly recommend it to others.  Before I bought my Lenovo I looked at a lot of notebook computers at my local big box store, but they were all pretty flimsy and felt more like a toy.  This one feels a lot more sturdy--more like a regular laptop.  I am very happy with my purchase.
A homerun update.  Small, fast, and value priced.  Apple is THE benchmark for laptop computers.  A serious contender for those wishing to switch from Microsoft PC based machines.
Excellent Laptop  This is an excellent laptop, both for business and personal use.  I'm not a gamer so I cannot comment on it's usefulness in that area but it is incredibly fast with Office 2010 and the Internet.  I had spent days looking at laptops, reading reviews, etc. when a friend of mine got this laptop through work and as soon as I used it, I ended my search and ordered this one. My laptop is my only computer and I use it to prepare my lesson plans (I teach computer classes at the high school level), for my graduate classes and research, and for the Internet. I love having the numeric keypad for data entry and, even though the keypad makes the computer bigger, it weighs the same as my previous 14 inch laptop.  My last computer had Windows Vista and I just never liked that as well as previous versions of Windows.  I find Windows 7 to be a giant improvement and am glad this computer came with it.  I don't know why the seller doesn't list its specs but I will include the major points below.  They are wonderful for an $800 laptop.  In addition, it has an anti-glare screen which I feel is a must-have on any computer I buy.  Once a person has the anti-glare, he or she will never go back to the traditional screen.  Windows 7 Professional 32 Intel Core(tm) i5-450M Processor (2.40 GHz, 3 MB L3 cache) 4 GB 1066 MHz DDR3 SDRAM 500 GB 7200 rpm 2.5-inch SATA II DVD+/-RW SuperMulti DL LightScribe ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4350 Broadcom 802.11a/b/g/n HP Integrated Module with Bluetooth 2.1 Wireless Technology Battery Type: HP 6-cell (47 WHr) Li-Ion Battery Life: up to 5 hours  While reading the reviews, I found some people complain that the HP mouse pad is too touchy and has a life of its own.  I know what they mean but have found that when that has happened, some part of one of my hands is touching the corner of the mouse pad.  That aside, I have no problems with the mouse pad and that is my preferred way to use it.  My friend that has the same laptop just purchased a wireless mouse and likes that better.  I highly recommend this laptop for the average user.  I have had 5 laptops and this is far superior to anything I've had or even worked with in the past.
Very pleased  Looks and runs as new! Very pleased
Fantastic little device!  I have a 15" top of the line mid-2010 MacBook Pro as my primary machine. I used to take it everywhere, but it is heavy and a pain to lug around. This little machine is perfect. It doesn't have enough RAM or hard drive space to do the serious photo and video-editing as my MBP, but for taking with me everywhere I go, it is perfect. I can write, browse the web, and watch videos just fine.  Build-quality is great, the battery is decent, and I haven't had any problems with overheating.  I have an iPad, but haven't used it much since getting this computer. The Air weights only slightly more, is only slightly bigger, but is many times as powerful.  I do recommend going with 4GB of RAM and a 128GB hard drive (middle of the line). 2GB of RAM and 64GB of hard drive space are both pretty slim.  This computer is perfect for what it is. A light, fast, ultraportable, that can be taken everywhere.
Very nice
Excellent living space web browsing machine  we bought this to replace an older ipad for web surfing and email from our living room as the ipad has become slow and laggy.  This chromebook is so much faster in every respect.  The scree is beautiful and can be see from any angle.  Boot up is instantly on and off.  Hard to believe you can get such a great laptop replacement with this performance for only $300.  I realize this is a chromebook, however 90% of what we do does not require a hard drive and windows operating system.  Love it!
Great balance of value and performance  I took a good look at this laptop when I was shopping around for a new computer for my mother-in-law, and while I ended up purchasing the HP DV6 there was a lot to like about the G60 line.  The HP G60 (and G70) are aimed at the home user looking for a desktop size screen but otherwise want traditional notebook specs (good battery life, lighter weight, etc...).  While not a true "desk-note" (it uses mobile cpus, most desk-notes use desktop class cpus) it will fill the "desk top" role for most users.  The build quality is pretty good.  Far above the basic "Compaq" line but not quite as nice as the DV line from HP.  What it is good at: Web browsing, light gaming (does well with anything other than 3D games), office apps (word, excel, power point, etc...) and basic media tasks (playing and creating MP3s, watching movies, editing short home movies).  What it is not good at: 3D gaming, editing large video files, or any heavy computational tasks.  Here is a quick break down of the specs:  Display: This 16" screen is a good bright display that works best indoors, but can be used outdoors except in direct sunlight.  A good display is an HP trademark and this one lives up to that standard.  CPU: The Intel Pentium T4300 is a good dual core CPU for light home use.  It is the newest version of the Pentium line and is based off the most advanced of the "Core2" processors.  (Pentiums are just "Core" or "Core2" CPUS with less cache and slower clock speeds.)  I'm a big fan of this CPU for people who mostly want to web browse - it's got two cores so you can surf while the anti-virus does it's job so why pay more for a CPU you won't use?  If you plan on doing any serious gaming this is not the CPU for you (though it's a lot better than older Pentiums based off the old "Core" cpus).  Memory: 3GB is plenty for light home use.  Again - plenty for web surfing and playing movies.  Not enough for serious gaming.  Graphics: Comes with Intel's new 4500 integrated graphics.  While this is a great improvement over previous Intel graphics parts it's still not going to run high-end 3D games at any decent resolution.  Old games and non-3D games will be fine.  HDD: 320GB is far more than most light home users will use.  I know few using more than 60GB.  However anyone who plans on editing home movies will need more space than this (and more memory, and a faster cpu...).  Battery: 6 cell lithium ION.  Pretty standard.  Gives you about 2-3 hours of light use.  If you order it custom from HP you can get an 8 cell.  However if you are looking for good battery life you really don't want the G60 line.  Look for something with a 14" display and at least an 8 cell battery.  Wireless: Most notebooks from high to low end are using the same few wireless chipsets.  This one is covers a wide wireless spectrum including the newest "Wireless N".  Weight: 6.7lbs is a good weight for a screen this large.  You will find them up to 8lbs.  Again if you are looking for serious mobility you want a thin-and-light, but if you want something you can easily carry from room to room this should suit you.
Love this laptop  I had never bought a Samsung product until I bought a Galaxy s3 a few months ago. I love my phone so decided to try this laptop. It's great too. A very fast but comfortable ride. The sound is pretty amazing too. Samsung has it together.
Love it :  Love it so far its doin everything i need it to do
Just what I needed.  Excellent laptop. I use it for School((CAD)
Nice
This thing is awesome  I love my Chromebook so far, as a college student It is a wonderful thing to have because its battery lasts for more than long enough for me to get through the day and then some. the keyboard has a nice feel as well as the touchpad gestures being so helpful. I would however caution new purchasers that this is not something i would recommend as getting instead of a standard pc, but if you already have one this is great because chrome remote desktop allows me to remote into my other pc to do anything i couldn't do on the chromebook
Love this laptop  Love this laptop!  Every game I've played on it so far (Skyrim, Civilization V, Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 4) has run flawlessly at MAX graphics.  This computer has very very little junk ware installed on it - removing it takes about two minutes.  I especially like that this laptop has a Steam button on it, making it easy to quickly open Steam.  It does not come with Microsoft Office - but the software will hound you to buy it until you uninstall the demo.  I personally like Libre more, because it's free and works.  This is a BIG Laptop - average laptop cases are too small for it.  The screen is a matte screen, thus no glare.  Keys are a standard size and are laid out well.  They are a bit far back, due to the huge track pad.  Overall, I love this laptop, and with the specs being at the top end of technology right now, I expect to have this laptop for at least three years - making the cost worth it.
The Asus 1005HA-MU17-BU Netbook  I've owned the Asus for a about a month-and-a-half now, and have been very happy with it's performance and size.  I did purchase a 2GB stick of RAM for it, which I would recommend, as well as a small carrying case to keep things neat.  It has worked flawlessly to date.  I remember reading someone's review indicating that it seemed to get overly warm with operation; I have not found that to be the case.  Asus indicates the battery should run for 8.5 hours between charges, but I suspect under normal operation that might be a bit overly-optimistic.  That being said, the battery does last quite a while before a re-charge is needed, and I like the fact that I can replace the battery myself if needed.  It also runs very quietly and that's a plus.  I'm running most of my desktop apps on this machine as well and have had no issues.  I would highly recommend this netbook for consideration.
Loved it needed a laptop thank you.
An Experiment that turned out great.  FYI --  I have a small computer repair shop and have been in business since 1998  This was just a little experiment. For 230 dollars,I purchased this little laptop to see how it would respond to an upgrade to 8 GB of ram and a solid state hard drive. My cost for the ram stick and SSD(120GB) was approximately $100.  So for $330, I have very fast 3lb 11oz laptop !!!  I thought about selling it ,but I like so much, I'm thinking about keeping it. I have also installed Windows 10 home . A sweet little machine for sure.
This is a great computer.  Very vivid screen.
Love it! Perfect little laptop for my lap
Immaculate  This is exactly what I needed. Works and looks brand new. Truly satisfied
Well worth it  Nice computer, does everything I want. Quick response, bright screen, nice look, plays WoW without lag, all in all I feel I got a good deal.
AMAZING!! College student*  Im a college student and was looking for a cheap new laptop. I saw this and thought id give it a try. I ordered it 2 days ago and and it came today. The company shipped it so quickly!! I opened it up and started to use it, there was no downloading software or waiting for a start up. It's great. The only thinking that is a little hard is getting used to the placement of the backspace button. Other than that, its great!!
This thinkpad is a powerfull and excelent laptop!! My CIO is happy with this.
Computer was easy to set up  Computer was easy to set up.. basically open box and start to use.  Have not had any issues.  I was not really ready for Windows 8, but have made the transition ok.  Only point that might impact someones purchase is the feel of the keyboard and track surface.  Both feel "light" .. not cheap but close..  But they both work fine.. so its only an emotions issue for someone that has another computer with "heavy" keys.
Great so far!  Before this laptop, I used to have a Sony Vaio E series (17.3").  Although the Vaio was somewhat bigger and more expensive it only lasted me for about 1.5 yrs.  I was desperate, since I needed a computer for college, and found this great piece of hardware, which has worked beautifully so far.  Performance is very nice and fast.  I would recomend anyone who is interested on a Windows 7 laptop, with great performance and a lower price than that of HP and Dell, Lenovo makes very decent laptops, and the ThinkPad is one of their best series out there.
Great product.  This machine hasn't given any problem. Really I love it. and recommend it. You can trust in what they sale.
Yeah
Heavy on features,light under your arm, and truly turns heads - the best, small laptop I've had but all laptops have limitations  I am a road warrior and have found this to be the best Laptop on the market for it's size. Not everyone needs a laptop this small, but for it's size it is incredibly feature packed and robust. I have had problems - My SD card reader doesn't work any more and I can't get the case open to check the connection or replace the part (Sony repair is out of the question - I can't survive long enough without the machine). Other than that it has been superb. Anyone that picks a laptop up by the display deserves for the display to crack. Don;t do it! Compared to an IBM/Lenovo this machine is a Porsche, they are comparable to Kia. Don't buy this machine if a heavier, thicker, armored brick will do the job, and if you are planning in abusing it. I LOVE mine.
ASUS Chromebook with 32GB SSD and 4GB Ram  As a previous owner of a Samsung Chromebook, I am VERY impressed with the ASUS Chromebook with 32GB and 4GB of memory. I love the glossy screen (cleans up easily) and use it primarily when I am watching sports on TV in the evening. Probably would not use in areas where I would have the glare of outside lights. Battery life is OUTSTANDING!! and YouTube videos are smooth and flowing which may be due to the new Intel Atom processor and 4GB Ram memory when compared to my old Samsung Chromebook. It feels slightly heavier than my old Chromebook and more solid which might be due to construction or battery. Best part was that I purchased this and subsequently was able to sell my old Chromebook (with half the ram and SSD storage) for a good price so this was a steal!
I love the Apple MacBook Pro can not find a cover for it I am looking for a  cover to fit over the bottom and the top can you help me find one thank
had this since 2012 still works great.
Just what I was looking for.
once i added a ssd this thing beets my i7 3rd gen laptop on benchmarks all day long!
Very satisfied!  The system is so responsive, fast and light-weight. I like it alot. I also like the display LCD when gaming or playing DVDs. The sound is also great from the built-in Altec Lansing speakers. It doesn't have a DVD burner but I really don't care about it. I have a separate DVD recorder attached to my TV anyways. I definitely recommend this system.
Yup, this is great
Love my new HP laptop  My new laptop is fast and easy to use.  I just need to find a travel bag that will fit it. Diagonally it measures 19"-hard to find a bag that will accomodate a laptop of this size.
Best reasonably priced gaming notebook  It's a great computer, bought it so I could play No Man's Sky since I only have an Xbox One and runs it perfectly. Surprisingly quiet and the red backlit keyboard makes it look sweet. The ASUS logo on top of the computer also lights up when the laptop is open
Great computer for the money  My daughter in college had broken her last computer and I bought this in an emergency as i didn't have enough money to buy her a computer with enough RAM for her to play the online games she likes to play (although she shouldnt be doing all that in college anyway lol).  But she hasn't complained at all and says it works well...she does her homework on it, multi tasks with the social media, streams music and videos and there's no lag.  She can play Mortal Kombat and other online games but she sets them with lower graphics so it can display ok.  Overall, a great computer for the money.
Yes!!  Love love love my new laptop! Easy to use, great exterior condition and so fast!
Acer  It is fast and allows me to view my Netflix and Hulu movies without any issues. I write documents, e-mail people, view documents, listen to Pandora or view musical videos on YouTube without issues.
If you want to treat yourself to something nice get a Predator  If your on a budget get the v17 Black Nitro Edition. If you want to treat yourself to something nice get a Predator.
... had this for a month now and I really like it. Crisp and clear display  Have had this for a month now and I really like it.  Crisp and clear display, great size, really nothing at all to complain about.
works great.. would recommend  works great..would recommend.
Superb example of an ultrabook  Keyboard and trackpad work very well, screen is amazing, weight is excellent. Battery life is amazing. FWIW, get the 8gb RAM version since the RAM is not upgradeable. The FHD non-touch screen will also give you better battery life than QHD touch screen. At a screen this size, I don't think the QHD is worth the drop in battery life. The SSD can be replaced, which is nice (since SSDs keep increasing in capacity and coming down in price). My only quibble is the placement of the webcam below the screen, but it's a small price to pay to have this big of a screen in a device this small.
I love  I have this laptop since 2009, never ever I had to replace any internal piece, since the first working perfectly and still working without any issue. I love it
Love this chrome book---- working like lightening and super cute:)
Great Computer  This is a really nice computer. Seems well bilt and the screen is awesome. I am editing videos on it and it is working well.
Excellent laptop
Great laptop  I received this laptop as a birthday gift in August, and I love it very much. Although this isn't the exact model that I have it is very similar. The only differences with mine is the model number. Mine is the L505-S5971. The other difference is that mine doesn't have all the other keys that are next to the power button up top. It's still a wonderful laptop. My first laptop was the HP COMPAQ that I bought myself in 2005. It has lasted me until it finally conked out on me completely this past July. So I definitely got my money's worth out of it. Hopefully this one will do the same. I love the features that it has on there. Although I must admit I do not know all of the technical stuff and what it means but it's allowing me to do things on here that I wasn't able to do on my COMPAQ. Great laptop. I definitely recommend this product. Whichever model you get from Toshiba. I'm very happy with mine.
Very Happy Customer!  I have been using this for Months now.  No complaints! Not one single issue.  I did upgrade my MSI Laptop by adding an MSATA Samsung 840 EVO SSD  The performance and capability of this machine has it's limits, I just haven't  personally found them (Yet). Imagine running (Multiboxing) 5 WOW Accounts all with Ultra Settings and still pulling off 35+ FPS - While running a single account I see FPS in the 120+ Range.  Excellent System by MSI!!!!
Great Machine  I bought this and other Macbook Pros .. they are all great machines. I hardly ever have to reboot, free software updates these days. Interface takes getting used to but once you get used to it, there's no going back to Windows.
Google and Toshiba combined to make one smart great chromebook  Bought one, had to buy another. Google and Toshiba combined to make one smart great chromebook. WOW!
Love this Laptop  Love this Laptop! I think the only down side in my opinion would be that I don't like windows 8 but that's can be fixed. That G-synced monitor looks beautiful.
excellent
Very trustworthy and reasonable seller. Good laptop.  The laptop is a 2010 model. Bought as a gift for my 10-year old who wanted a laptop. Shes a little hard on electronics so I wasn't going to spend too much on a brand new one. The price was right. I was worried about the condition since it was a gift. True to the description, it has some surface scratches easily hidden with a shell case (a cute purple case purchase on amazon). It booted right up and I installed the new IOS which it runs just fine. Daughter was over the moon! After a couple days hours, though, the battery blew out, causing the track pad to become very stiff though the laptop still worked (I leaned this by googling). I watched a couple you tube videos, felt confident enough to try replacing the battery. I bought a non-Apple battery and the little special screwdriver on Amazon from another seller for $38. I replaced the battery and that solved the problem. Then, I emailed this seller explaining the situation, and offered to send them the original blown battery as proof. I just asked that they reimburse me for the $38. They replied immediately and credited me $38 immediately. I really appreciated this. They could have been jerks and told me that I had sent the laptop back, but they didnt. I will definitely buy from them again when my younger kid demands her own laptop, lol.
Hubby loves his new Netbook.  My husband who is hard to please with anything  is very happy with his new Netbook. He loves the lite weight of it. He loves how fast it is too. I like it too. The screen took getting used to being smaller. But ow we don't even notice anymore.
Never going back to pc!!!!  For christmas my boyfriend bought me a Mac pro 13.  After going through several HP computers that keep needing the hard drive replaced about once a year we got tired of spending $700 for crap computers.  While I didn't like spending the money for a Mac you have consider the peace of mind you get.  Having my desktop hacked recently and not being able to turn it on it only drove home the fact that you get what you pay for. I love my Mac it is so easy to use I never have a problem with it no more freezing, losing my stuff or having issues period.  I also got my son an iPad to replace his NetBoot which got hacked as well.  My family is now and forever a apple user.  I'm working on getting a Mac desk top for my business although my Mac book pro works great for my business as well. My only complaint is there is no one note for Mac I depend heavily on it to "print" thing off internet without killing trees and as of yet haven't found a program I like as much. To protect my investment in got a speck matte cover which has already saved my Mac from scratches and silicone keyboard cover which I love. I never considered these items with my pc bc I thought they would give out so fast it wouldn't be worth it. Now that I have a com outer that will last for years it's worth it. When I was researching macs I found people saying there 2006 macs still worked fine they just wanted an updated one. That one statement won me over I haven't had a pc work for more than a year much less since 06 says a lot about apple. We have iPhones, iPads, and MacBook  looking to get iMac and mini Mac soon!
A GREAT LAPTOP  I was worried about getting the new Windows 8, but now I am glad I did get it.  Microsoft really has changed the Windows as we have known them.  It is NOTHING like the previous ones we have had before. It is so amazing with what they came up with.  I am still learning all the new changes.  Now for the Dell product? It is a very nice laptop. The problem that I had was the end of the DVD door kept falling off. I went ahead and returned it. Amazon couldn't replace it. It was out of stock. I went ahead and ordered another Dell but it is 17", and has more specs that are greater. I first started with the Dell Desktop and later the Dell Laptop. After that stage, I got the Toshiba Laptops.  Now I am back with Dell and am staying there.  It shows so much quality and this Silver color is beautiful. The outer edge is a light silver and the rest looks like medium brush aluminum color.  It is heavier than the others I had. I wouldn't want to carry it all over the place. I just use mine in my home. It runs really cooler than the older ones did.  It turns on really fast and the whole system runs fast. There is no cons here. The problem I did have was really odd, but I still want the same type of laptop. I am sure if you did order this, after it is restocked, you won't have any problems and I know that you will love it, too. I hate the idea when I do get the new one, I will have to put my settings and programs all back in, again. That does take a lot of time. I definitely would recommend that you buy a Dell laptop. It is the way to go.
Great laptop! Boots up quick and it's responsive  Great laptop!  Boots up quick and it's responsive. Using it for business and so having a responsive computer is amazing!
Excellent customer service  Being clumsy as I always am, I dropped poin2 chromebook end of last year. It was really frustrating because this was a Christmas gift for a friend. When I contacted poin2 service center about this, not only was their customer service personnel kind and understanding, but they also replaced me with a brand new one!!! My friend says it works perfectly to this date and I am so thankful. I just really wanted to say that the poin2 support experience was excellent. Thanks once again.
The best value out for a quality chromebook that can pretty much do it all!  Hands down the best value for a 1080p screen in the land of Chromebook ... The keyboard works fine for its intended purposes, i guess i wouldnt exactly want to type a 40 page paper on it but for browsing, writing reviews, sending e-mails etc. it is perfectly perfect!  The little centered hidden speaker in this thing does a great job and producing loud pronounced music with no distortion ... It also does a great job of creating a stereo effect when sitting in front of it (like most people do with a chromebook).  The screen is A+ quality, the color reproduction is great the blacks are black and with full brightness on its quite the sight at such a small price. Toshiba was the only company i could find that used a nice 1080p screen in this price range w/o skimping on the rest of the machine.  The plastic shell is kinda cheap and has chipped in spots, but it does its job just fine ... the screen hinges can get a bit flimsy if you are being careless with the chromebook but all in all it is well made for the price range.  The computer starts instantly and is very quick ... I have had around 75 tabs opened and could cycle through them seamlessly all while streaming high quality music from google.play .. I am quite impressed with its performance. Of course i am not using this thing for gaming or any of the like, just as a browser and e-mail machine and for that it KILLS the job! This is the 1.7 GHZ processor and i cant imagine needing the bigger processor in this thing unless you plan to do some heavier browsing but i cannot see the smaller one having a problem handling it.  The only thing this is missing is a touchscreen, which i imagine the next iteration of this chromebook will probably contain.
Dell refurb  This is the first time I have bought a refurbished product. I must say this laptop has by far exceeded ALL my expectations. Has been running like a dream ever since the first boot up. No glitches, no unnecessary software packages clogging up the hard drive. :) Only one very minor flaw on the case.  I have to send kudos along to Florida Laptops. I'm super impressed with them. The laptop arrived in a well padded package, right on schedule. Have been recommending them to friends and will definately look them up again the next time I need a laptop.
So Far So Good  I purchased the ASUS G73W ROG Limited Edition with the i7 740, dual 500gb drives, gtx 460M, 16gb RAM, and the Blue Ray Burner.  I am extremely impressed with this laptop.  Haven't tested the Blue Ray Burner feature yet.  Has performed flawless so far on multitasking.  Opened Adobe Photoshop CS3, Media Center with a TV Tuner attached broadcasting digital ATSC in 1080i, Internet Explorer browsing, and several gadgets on the desktop running.......all of this running at the same time and I only took up just over 3gb RAM used.........this laptop never flinched during all of this.  This has run flawless on benchmark tests with DirectX 10 and under so far.  Ran Extremely smooth on 3D Mark Vantage software.  Displayed 1000 fps regularly on a batch file which was a demo loop of Quake 3 Arena I have for benchmarking and frames testing on older PC's.  This laptop has so far been a beast and more than my expectations.  Only wishes would be more USB 3.0 ports, eSATA, DVI out, and an express card slot for possible expansion, but these are small things in what this laptop packages.  No regrets buying this laptop.  If anyone needs a do all laptop for any tech hungry person then this laptop should satisfy for some time.
Not Many 5-Star Reviews In My Profile  To others considering this machine, while the Chromebook is, in a technical sense, a computer, it is not to be confused with a standard Windows or Macintosh desktop or laptop. The Chromebook does not use either the Windows or Mac operating system, but a Google browser-based OS (operating system). For eMail and basic Microsoft work, the machine is (except for the somewhat disorienting keyboard layout and missing function buttons) ideal.  If you want to do desktop publishing (Adobe), huge spreadsheets, or advanced computer-based games, buy a "real" computer--and spend another $1,000 and spend months fighting with Windows 10 (which is pretty much being forced upon everyone due to the collusion between M'Soft and the manufacturers). BTW, if you have previously used Windows NT or 7, DO NOT make the mistake of buying a Windows 10 machine. Like thousands of others, you'll wind up at your local computer repair place begging them to install Windows 7--and gladly paying for the privilege.
It has been a good purchase for our younger son  The laptop came as advertised. It has been a good purchase for our younger son.
Nice gaming laptop, and the price is reasonable. :)
It is fantastic  At the first glance at my chromebook, i was shocked by how it can be so light weighted and slime it was.  The functionality was good and overall processing was fantastic.  Although I was totally new to the Chrome OS, I soon learned how it worked and actually it was pretty easy to use.  I'd say chromebook works best at internet web browsing and for word document purposes.  Just like how I was not aware of downloading exe. file does not work on Chrome OS, I think many of the future users should  know about that and be aware that chromebook is merely for web browsing.
Great laptop. Second one that I have purchased.
Je suis PC et Windows 7 c'etait mon idee  I waited a couple of months to review this computer so I could be sure I continued to like it as much as I did from the first. I do. We've made a lot of trips already and the size, battery life and screen have been excellent on the airplane as a replacement for my equally teeny beloved Sony TR3A. So far no hiccups in dependability or performance.   I carry the Acer in a sleeve in my briefcase which protects it from scratches and can be put through airport security as is as long as there are no wires or cables in the sleeve. For the fingerprint magnet issue, I carry an eyeglass cloth in the sleeve. I'm the one in the airport shining the top of my laptop.   I really appreciate the 3 USB slots, the two-finger mouse actions, the VGA connection for my LCD presentations, and definitely Windows 7 was my idea. And to JK, I am successfully networked to my Windows XP desktop so hope you resolve that problem.   Here's the sleeve that fits perfectly:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CaseCrown-Faux-Suede-Protective-Sleeve-with-Shoulder-Strap-and-Pocket-Blue-Asphalt-for-Acer-Aspire-One-Pro-11-6-inch-Netbook/dp/B00286Q602/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CaseCrown Faux Suede Protective Sleeve with Shoulder Strap and Pocket - Blue Asphalt for Acer Aspire One Pro 11.6-inch Netbook</a>
Works Well For Our Needs - Highly Recommended  This Lenovo B50-45 Business Notebook is a good choice for small business owners. We are using it for performing web searches and editing documents in MS Office.  The computer is good overall quality and was up and running on our shop's wireless network in just a few minutes after taking it out the box, which was quite impressive. This has a nice large display that is easy on the eyes and quite clear when displaying pictures. My wife particularly likes that the keyboard has a number pad, which makes data entry much faster than with her old laptop. The notebook runs fast enough for our needs but we really are not taxing the CPU or memory very hard with our office programs.  Overall, this works well for our small office needs and was a reasonable value for the price.  Highly Recommended!  CFH
Slick Laptop choice  I am a independent repair tech and was looking for a replacement for my Dell 3 year old xps1530.  Was looking for something with all the new tech and power I could get for about $1k. The i7 powered n53sv-A2 fits the bill.  Silver Aluminum looks great and the unit worked perfectly out of the box. Had to do usual removal of  software that was not useful but not a big problem. Put it through 3 solid days of software loading and testing and the unit did very well. No problems noted. Everything just worked.. Unit runs very very cool. The A2 model has Blue ray,a top notch screen,usb3 and great speaker system  that are all pluses. The face recognition logon software is also nice not to mention the I7 cpu gives it speed when there is a need.  Warranty info You get 2 years  warranty  included in the purchase  price( most are 1 year) also 1 year of no fault damage ( normally something you pay extra for). I do suggest the  purchase of  an additional "ASUS Offered"  1 year warranty extension($90.00) just round out the protection to a 3 year package. Lojack theft software and Norton 360 would also be nice additions .  I would have no trouble suggesting this to a student, office or a home business user. JP
samsung chromebook  We bought this as a christmas gift for my mother. The chromebook is really good product. We ended up buying one for us and the price is right. It does everything a person needs.
A great computer for students  I initially ordered the Acer Aspire One AO722-BZ454 11.6-Inch HD Netbook, but returned it due to a mechanical problem (keyboard was loose- not sure if it's the way it's built or a lemon). I'm very happy I didn't order another Acer but decided to try the Asus Eee! I'm using this a college laptop, and it will serve that purpose well. I like the screen size (12.1) better than the Acer (11.6)- the resolution seems better, and I can work with excel sheets with more ease.  Since I intend to do a lot of note taking, the keyboard is extremely important to me. I LOOOVE this keyboard. It's slightly jumpy, which makes for a really easy typing job. I had no problem switching for my Imac keyboard to this one- they're very similar in style.  I've installed iTunes, MS Office 2010, Skype, Photos Ps Pro, and the computer can handle all of them side by side with no decrease in speed. I Still use my imac for bigger downloads or to store my pictures and big files. But overall i'm very happy with the speed.  Size and weight- I find it very light and portable. I'm sure I'll be taking it for trips, short or long.  Overall I'm extremely pleased. I'm not too knowledgeable about computers so the specs don't mean much to me, but my user experience so far has been excellent. I hope this review helps if you're someone who needs a relatively fast, easy going,practical computer.  btw- I really like the red ("cranberry") color. I was a little put off by the pic, but it's very handsome in real life!
Great, lightweight size  The Google interface takes some getting used to, but this chrome book takes care of all my internet needs. Great, lightweight size.
Very comfortable. Reliable  Just as advertised. Very comfortable. Reliable.
Recommended  The product works fine.
Thank you
so far so good!  As I have only had this for a few weeks, it has worked flawlessly! My only complaint would be that it only has a mono speaker and not very loud. you can always add speakers or use headphones as I do to get pure stereo!
the best laptop I've used, image quality, very fast, the happiness
Excelent product.
love it
9.5 / 10  Great specs. Smooth. Loads fast. Good construction.  Love the non glare IPS screen. No complaints so far.  If the specs match what you want then grab it because everything else about it is great too.  The only issue i might have is the keyboards flex seems a little cheap but it doesn't bother me like it might to others.  9.5/10
I am quite pleased with this little laptop computer  I am quite pleased with this little laptop computer. It isn't a game computer, but for writing and working on the web it works quite well. I will say that I do play the Windows 10 edition of Minecraft on the laptop with no problems, but that isn't really the reason I bought the laptop. I wanted a compact package that I can take with me to work on my writing projects and to do web research and this laptop fits the bill for this purpose. It comes with Windows 10 64bit and I am able to use all the Open Office tools with no problems at all. Surfing the web works well and since I am on a 5G connection and get no lag at all when doing web research. Overall I would recommend this laptop if you need a workhorse for writing, web research, email or other basic needs, and you can get bit of Minecraft on the side as a bonus.
Great buy  I had spent a lot of time researching many options to find a ultrabook that could compete with the Macbook Air.  I had almost given up and resolved to purchase the Apple/eat Ramen for months to justify the cost when I decided to purchase this computer.  I love this machine.  It starts up fast, the battery life is incredible, the exterior design is stellar, and the display is lovely.  My only complaint would be the sound quality.  The speakers, even at their highest volume, are tinny and can be somewhat hard to hear if you are wandering away from your computer (which I tend to do while listening to podcasts and multitasking at work).  This is nothing that a wireless speaker can't fix.  It also sounds just fine through headphones.  Some other reviews had complained about how loud the trackpad can be when you are clicking on it; however, much like on an iMac, you can tap twice in the same spot on the trackpad to select something without having to click the trackpad down.  This machine is incredibly portable.  It is very lightweight and slim.  It will fit in any slim case for a 13".  Tip: this is possibly due to my own ignorance, but it took me a while to find the 'home', 'pageup/down' and 'end' keys.  It turns out that you just hit 'fn'+one of the arrows for this function.  Lightbulb moment.
Love it  Fast and easy. Great display and processor.  Good sound. Nice to have numeric key pad.
great machine
love, love, love.
Great Computer  Great computer and I have not had one problem.
very cool little unit  very cool little unit....the screen pops on and off easily.  You probably wouldn't want it for long time desk use, but it's spectacular for what it is.
very nice laptop. everything works as it should. especially like the lighted keyboard. makes typing much easier.
For users like me, this is awesome  I LOVE this machine.  I know it is not for everyone because of their needs but for me, it's perfect.  I am not a tech guy that got the test computer, I think of myself as more of a regular business guy worried about my calendar, email, word processing, online banking, quickbooks online, news websites, Netflix, Spreadsheets, to do lists, linked In , twitter, facebook.  I thought long and hard before I purchased it, and as long as you are a fan of the google versions of these, specifically google docs then this is the perfect machine. I already ran a lot of my life on Google.  Gmail, Google Docs, Google Calendar.  So your decision to purchase this has a lot to do with whether living in the Google World makes sense for you.  You can try that world for free before you buy.  This machine does what I want perfectly.  I go home for the weekend and use it multiple times a day and there is no need to plug it into the charger.  It is light weight, the screen is bright, easy to type on.  I don't turn it off until I go to bed, I just close the lid to put it to sleep and then open it and I am off and running almost instantly.  I think this product is misunderstood by many.  If your needs for a laptop are like me then you should consider it.  You can do a lot more with it then me because of all the Google Aps, which I have loaded lots of cool ones.  But I still use it like I said above.  For me it's what I want.
great for work  Great laptop for work or business.  Not the best for any high intensity games but videos/movies etc are nice.  You can customize for a more efficient windows 7 hybrid if work requires upgrade...
Apple Computers are geat!  My granddaughter loves her Apple computer.  She says that it is the best.  Thank you, Amazon!
Laptop is amazing its fast and handle AAA games like a pro  Laptop is amazing its fast and handle AAA games like a pro, one downsize is the speakers, the are horrible and unusable you need a headset or another method apart from using the laptop speakers! If you can live with that then buy it
good
Durable for children  This computer has a clear screen, an easy key board and is durable enough for handling by children. Good choice.
The Eee PC Excels  The Asus Eee PC certainly doesn't look as sleek as the ultra portable Macbook Air, but most laptops are not as sleek as Apple or Sony products. Still, the Eee PC is a genuinely ultra-portable  everyday workhorse with features, performance, and value that make it a terrific machine.  I think the Eee PC is probably one of the best values in computing technology you will ever find.  I bought the black 4 G Surf, which means it has a 4 Gig SSD (drive) and does not come with an onboard web cam.  I like this machine.  It boots up fast and quietly; when I turn it on its ready for me in 20 seconds.  No Windows machine I am aware of can deliver that kind of performance on the hardware the Eee PC runs on.  It comes pre-installed with all the software you need to be productive, which is good since this machine does not have an optical disc drive. To install additional software, you do not have to buy a disc drive; instead, you can connect the Eee PC to a network or the internet using the built-in wifi 802.11 b/g connection and download additional software; downloading is also a good way to access updates for the pre-installed software. A BIOS update from AsusTek is already waiting for users of the 4G model.  Since this machine is genuinely ultra-portable, I carry it with me nearly everywhere I take my knapsack. At 2 lbs, it is hardly noticeable.  Unlike most notebooks, the Eee PC's power cord is light weight and the SD card I use for extra disc storage weighs less than a penny.  In the office, I use a Windows XP desktop, at home I have a Macbook Pro, and for travel integrating the Linux-based Asus has been seamless and easy even though the Eee PC is the third operating system I am using.  Thanks to the open source software that runs on the Eee PC, I can create documents that are compatible with anything on my Macbook Pro or Windows PC.  Although I might be considered  a "power user," believe me anyone can pick up the Eee PC and use it out-of-the box without any prior experience with Linux;you simply point and click your way to whatever you want.  And, for the power user, you can do virtually anything on this machine with the flexibility of installing whatever you want on this machine including installing a new operating system or entirely changing the original set up.  With all of the choices open to computer users and the bargain basement cost, I am not sure why the Eee PC has not received more media attention in the U.S.  This is a terrific machine for everyday tasks like web browsing, emailing, document creation, and even writing this review.  I highly recommend the Eee PC as a second computer for adults, a first computer for a child or an ultra portable computer for anyone.  A Few Issues that Matter  Keyboard Size:  Some folks may not like the keyboard. The Eee PC uses a small key board; it is probably one-fifth to one-fourth the size of a typical laptop keyboard. I can type fast on this keyboard, but the keyboard is not as responsive as my MBP keyboard and the right-shift key is too small - - it is too easy to mistakenly hit the larger enter key instead. Having said that, I think the keyboard is very usable, but be prepared to spend some time adapting to the small keyboard before you are able to type quickly and accurately on it.  Screen: The 7-inch display is crisp and sharp, but not as bright as some laptops and the resolution is only 800x480 pixels. You are going to scroll the screen more than you would on a 15-inch desktop or laptop. To alleviate this problem, be prepared to buy one accessory: a wireless mouse. The touchpad is responsive, but I think touch pads are particularly poor pointing devices when a lot of scrolling is required.  Disc size and Memory: The solid state hard drive is fast and responsive.  Applications load quickly and disc access occurs with a breeze. Although nearly half of the 4 GB SSD is used by the pre-installed software, you can use SD cards to extend your storage capacity.  I have over 1 GB of space available on the internal SSD with nearly 50 data files installed. Unless you are installing large video or music files, your data files are not likely to occupy a lot of storage space. Remember, the Eee PC is for productive work, data communications, and Internet access, it is not your game PC and I wouldn't use it like an iPod either.  Battery life: I have been able to get slightly over 3 hours of battery life out of the Eee PC when I turn wifi off.
FANTASTIC LAPTOP  It is a beautiful piece. It has many features and I hope will last almost forever. Important to mention that I started using it few days ago.
Pleased.  Very pleased, like the touch screen, very responsive.
Good laptop  Traditionally I hate laptops versus desktop computers but this has been a great machine especially for the money. The only complaint I have, that I also have with all laptops, is the very short battery life when unplugged. The speaker set up is not that great, very quiet and on the bottom.
Great value from a decent company.  Great value from a decent company.
Best Price/Weight/Performance Ratio (~$650)  If you can get this for ~$650 it has the best price/weight/performance ratio. I've been using it for 3 months and I love it for what it is. I use it as a secondary work/gaming pc on the road. My primary machine is a custom built desktop. There are two things I wish were better on it. 1) The screen. Overall its acceptable. Games look good on it. Some times text are fuzzy on it. The colors are off. (note: I use a Asus VG248QE at home and an iMac for work.) 2) The key travel on the keyboard. To me it feels a little lighter than a mac's keyboard. Still acceptable but below average. The space bar is the biggest problem. It wouldn't register as a press if you hit it on the edges.
Great Laptop  The computer is the fastest I've ever seen to start up. It has great battery life. Bright screen and easy to type keyboard.  No complaints
Works perfect  The laptop is excellent. The only thing I don't like is that I have to lock the mouse every time I run it.
Excellent laptop!  I recomend it. It is a very nice laptop! Very good for the price! This laptop is a very nice looking laptop,runs pretty fast.
Nice  Great for internet surfing.
Great computer!  I was looking for a fairly cheap but reliable computer to take the New York bar exam on since my netbook couldn't support the software. So I scoured the reviews of similarly priced computers and eliminated any computers that had problems with blue screening, etc. This computer was the winner. I've now had it for a month and a half and have not had any problems. It ran Examsoft without a problem. It boots up quickly. The keyboard is very similar to a Mac type keyboard (i.e. all the keys are like islands unto themselves), which I find to be quite comfortable (I was worried about losing typing speed switching over from my computer). Pages and programs load quickly and it can handle a zillion screens being open at the same time (very helpful for the last three weeks of bar prep). Also, it's not something I cared about when buying the computer, but the built in speakers are pretty impressive for laptop speakers haha.
LOVE this Chromebook  LOVE this Chromebook!!!!!!!!  Works like a dream, shipped quickly, and can be used for much more than people think! I recommend getting the protective shell for this as it does get dirty easily.
Apple did it again!  This is a must have upgrade for those having a white MacBook. Pros: * Battery lasts around 6 hours * LED backlighting provides ultra crisp images. * The integrated subwoofer and speakers provide a sound output with more body. * Thinner than most laptops, I think is less than an inch. * DDR3 ram * Nvidia graphics card * illuminated keyboard * This laptop works like a charm with Microsoft's Windows 7  Cons: * Price is always a con in apple products * 2gb ram is not enough for todays average laptop specs * Single audio/input port * This is a con/pro, you need an adapter for outputting to external monitors. And your previous adapters won't work. But this feature will let you to connect your laptop to different video sources (VGA, DVI, HDMI, SVideo)
Chromebook Shines in Laptop Arena  Got this for the wife to replace a Windows laptop. She absolutely loves it; the speed, overall size, display quality, weight, etc. It also doesn't hurt that we've been dyed-in-the-wool Android/Chrome users for years now, so it natively syncs with our other electronics.
Excelente!
Great machine for the price  The Samsung Chromebook is an incredibly useful device. When my laptop died, I decided to take a chance and go for the Chromebook. I haven't looked back. The machine works as advertised and, for my life and work, there aren't any non-web programs that I miss.
These Chromebooks are great!  I already own a refurb Samsung Chromebook and use it all the time, so, I got this for my Mom. Have to say it's probably even better than the Samsung. The page loading is better, most likely because of its better processor. The lid is a bit more difficult to start to open. Looked brand new when received, no scratches on exterior and so far haven't noticed faulty pixels in display, though, I haven't tested that. So far, this is performing better than expected and I consider it a bargain for less than I got my Samsung. I know some people say these Chromebooks aren't true laptops, but, unless you're a serious gamer, I'd say these are more than adequate. My Chromebook has become my main computing device.
I purchased two laptops for my 12 year old twins. So far each computer is working well and we have no complaints. I am evening thinking about ordering one for myself.
GREAT QUIET & LIGHTWEIGHT LAPTOP  I've had this laptop for a little over two months now, and I really do like it.  One of the main reasons I bought it ,is because it has no fan.  It is super quiet and extremely lightweight. I mainly just use it for browsing the web and checking my email, so it definitely serves its purpose.  Some reviewers have had problems with their touchscreen, especially not working after it comes out of sleep mode, so far I have not had any problems with the touchscreen, it has always worked very good.  The only problem that I have, is that occasionally I get an error message saying "Display Driver not responding, but has recovered". That has been more of a nuisance, it hasn't affected the computer's performance.  I have called Asus and Microsoft both about this error message, but they were neither able to help, so I don't know if the problem is with the Asus laptop or with Windows 10. Other than that I am very happy with the laptop.
Works the way I wanted it to do.
Love my chromebook  Absolutely love my chromebook! When my 7 year old laptop went caputs, I knew I wanted to replace it with something simple, fast, light and affordable. I do not download large files, I do not create large media files. I wanted something for basic Internet research (ie researching real estate, jobs, online shopping, travel plans, entertainment plans, creating resumes)  The chromebook is exactly what I was looking for. It starts up super quickly, is synced with my Google Drive and email, runs clean, charges quickly, holds a charge for a long period of time. If you are a gamer, create digital media/art or enjoy downloading and storing large media files this is not for you. But if you need something simple and efficient, this acer chromebook may suit your needs as it did mine.
wonderful and light device  Great product. Ultra light. Nice performance. Good looking. Just be careful it doesnt have a RJ45 port which can be fixed with a usb converter
i love my laptop but its a bit heavy i use this for gaming. the internet card has given me some problems but asside from that the laptop is ok i am also very rough with my electronics so i know that this laptop is a worrier.
A great 2nd computer  The Chromebook is an awesome 2nd computer. I've had many laptops and netbooks over the last couple of years; including 2 Asus EEEPC netbooks, a Toshiba Netbook, Macbook 13"(2006), Dell XPS 13" (2007), and this has to be one of my favorite computers. I've also used a Macbook Air 13" - my dad's and a Dell XPS 13" (2012) - my sister's, and I was debating between the Chromebook and a Macbook Air 11", and I'm happy I went for this.  I was essentially looking for a computer to do basic web browsing, typing (a lot of documents to type and edit), watching occasional videos (streaming via Hulu, Netflix or Plex), and listen to some music, and this little computer does all of it for a super competitive price. I am using Google Docs and Outlook.com's Word support to edit/type all my documents. Netflix/Plex stream without a problem. Spotify/8Tracks work without a hitch. I really don't use anything else on a regular basis; especially when I am sitting in a cafe or when I am on the road. The offline support for Google Docs is also handy if you're stuck without internet.  The main problems I had with all the netbooks were that the resolution was terrible, the monitor felt too small, the chassis bulky and cheap, and the keyboard dismal. The chromebook is how a netbook should be. The resolution is great, the keyboard phenomenal, and the computer is super light (barely heavier than a Macbook Air 11") and feels well built even though the construction is plastic.  I still keep have my Dell XPS hooked up to a monitor to do some advanced stuff - some programming, photo editing, apps that require a decent Windows computer. But I highly doubt that I'll be using that pc on a daily basis to do the basic stuff anymore.  Oh another impressive factor is that this computer makes no noise, barely emits heat, and boots up super fast. And even with a whole bunch of tabs open - Spotify App, Google Docs, 5 other tabs, there was little to no lag in the system.  I really can't ask much more for 250$.
Happy Buyer  I purchased this product on Amazon and have been using it for approximately 3 weeks. I am very satisfied with it's overall performance and love the styling.  Windows 8 took some getting used to, but I can fully appreciate it in conjuction with this ultrabook's touchscreen. One thing that still bothers me is the lack of the start icon in the lower left. After three weeks I still have trouble remembering where to place the mouse or my finger in order to bring up menus and navigate to certain things.  I'll get it eventually. I recommend watching some of the instructional videos online if you've never used a touchpad like this Vaio's before.  This is my first notebook/ultrabook purchase. Before my purchase I was concerned about the number of USB ports (only 2) and the lack of a cd/dvd drive.  So far the number of USB has not been an issue.  I purchased a Microsoft blu-ray mouse to avoid using a USB ports that.  I also purchased a inexpensive USB hub for use when needed.  I have not yet purchased an external CD/DVD drive as this machine is in addition to a laptop and desktop which both have one but I have researched and found them to be relatively inexpensive.
Great midrange laptop  Was nervous buying this laptop as I hadn't heard of MSI ,but am glad I did! The price is about 100 dollars more now. This is a great mid range laptop I play World of Tanks daily and it plays well. It came on time and not loaded with bloatware just what you need to begin. Love the killer ethernet suite and the keyboard is solid. I will buy another MSI product soon.
Very Good laptop. No issues at all. Price and performance works better
Excellent product
Not a toy !  It does what it says it will.  It is a small android laptop.  For those who want to work on the go, like a keyboard and mouse it is perfect.  The included productivity software will open and edit word, excel and powerpoint files to a degree and read images, video and .pdf documents just like the bigger laptops.  Inexpensive enough to lose and limited in capacity so you won't have "all your eggs in one basket" if you misplace it.  Wifi and ethernet for the internet, regular size SD cards for storage and the gps-nav software is accurate to a few meters.  This is not for kids.  No touch screen means I can accurately use my mouse and my Logitech Wireless mouse works great plug and play.  For the elementary school age- buy them a 7" or 10" tablet for the same price to play games on....  they won't really need a "computer" till Jr. High and most could get along fine with this netbook if there's a computer at home to do the extensive editing and printing.  This is a unit you need as a second computer and travelling companion.
expectations met  Product came in great shape All of my expectations were met, some of my initial concerns were that the speakers were supposed to be quite, but they are loud enough for daily viewing and watching. Keyboard is very nice, better than the dell xps13 I owned. As for battery, depending on use you can get 4-6hrs of use, although this is only with the battery saver option set. without you are looking at about 3-4 hours if you are streaming videos. The finish is nice, colour is darker than what I imagined, but looks very elegant.
Good Computer  I bought this for a student and she really likes it.  It is fast and easy to use.  Nice and light and the ability to separate it to use it as a tablet is good.  Quality is very good, especially at the price point.
Very good, high-quality product!  We are a large family with all boys.  Therefore, quality is EXTREMELY important to us.  This Ruggedized Chromebook gets high marks from us! I spent a lot of time researching and comparing the various Chromebooks available and selected this one.  I knew that I wanted an Asus.  Then I compared the various Asus models.  This "Ruggedized" version was about $20 more than another one I was considering.  Ultimately I chose this one and am so glad that we did.  We have all boys.  Items get a lot of wear and tear.  The keyboard is waterproof, although as of yet we haven't needed to test that.  I like that the bottom has a bit of grip to it, so the device doesn't slide around easily.  We have Netflix on the bar at the bottom and our 3-year-old has easily figured out how to access his favorite show all by himself.  We bought this item to reduce wear and tear on my personal laptop.  The Chromebook is used for Netflix (we use the HDMI port and connect to our TV), internet browsing, etc.  We love this purchase so much that we have it in our cart and plan on purchasing another one.
great laptop, loving it
Absolutely perfect  The X1 Carbon must be my 9th or 10th computer.  Without a doubt the best system I have ever used -- perfect in every way.  I purchased it for travel, but it has become my main computer..
... really don't have enough words to describe everything I love about this computer  I really don't have enough words to describe everything I love about this computer. It is truly a beast. It is super light and super quiet. I love the keyboard, especially with the numeric keypad. The screen is beautiful and the touch is responsive and easy. It has been worth every penny. You can read the specs for yourself and know that you are getting everything in one beautiful package.
Looks good. It's my workhorse laptop on the road  For that price ??? It certainly does the job. Looks good. It's my workhorse laptop on the road. Runs all work apps well.
Very pleased with this purchase.  Initial quality problem, but great Amazon service and great machine overall.  After doing quite a bit of research, I bought this laptop for my son who just started college. It's way more than powerful than he needs for his schoolwork, but we went with it because he's into gaming also and this machine is a great solution for both.  It doesn't have the absolute latest and greatest graphics card, but it's still on the higher end of the scale and is in the sweet spot on the price/performance curve.  It's less than half the price of some of the top end machines I looked at and is still a huge improvement over the gaming desktop rig he's replacing.  With the SSD, it boots up very quickly and performance is excellent overall. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the case was.  For what it's worth, this is a really slick-looking machine compared to most office laptops.  I really want one for myself.  The dual fans are quiet and work great to keep this machine running cooler than some less powerful machines I've used.  That's more important than some people realize if you want the laptop to last along time without problems.  I'm afraid I can't comment on gaming performance at the moment.  My son would know more about that.  I'll update this review if I get any feedback from him one way or the other.  I do have to mention that he began having issues less than 3 weeks after we received the laptop.  It wouldn't boot up or would freeze up while he was using it.  Fortunately, the built-in diagnostics helped me quickly narrow down the problem to the memory in Bank 0.  Dell used a "SKhynix" brand memory that I've never heard of before.  I had bought an extra 8GB of Kingston memory when I purchased the laptop, so I just pulled the bad memory and swapped it in.  The machine has worked perfectly since then.  I came really close to dropping my score to a 4 because of it, but despite that problem I'm still really happy with the machine and I think the price was good.  What really made the difference, though, was outstanding Amazon customer service.  I was afraid I'd have to hassle with sending the machine in for service so they could check the memory themselves.  Instead, Amazon just credited my account for the cost of the extra Kingston memory I had bought and it was a done deal.  I don't think I would have had the same experience if I had bought directly from Dell or a big box electronics store.
good, but some time  good,  but some time hot
still not sure about the touch screen thing but love my new computer
Really good product, and enjoy using it daily  Really good product, and enjoy using it daily! I enjoy playing Bridge, card game, most days of the week, and like having my emails daily also.
I've thoroughly enjoyed working on this Chromebook  Over the last (almost) 2 years, I've thoroughly enjoyed working on this Chromebook. The screen is big enough that you don't miss the standard 15.6" laptop screen, the startup takes no time at all, the processor is snappy enough (come on, it's a Celeron, not an i7), 4 GB of RAM is plenty for streaming video seamlessly or, like myself, having 10 tabs open at once, the updates are quickly conducted, awesome security, and having Google Drive right here adds to peace of mind. During the last 2 years, I've used this Chromebook for business as well as pleasure, and I can safely say that, overall, it's the best and most enjoyable experience I've (to date) ever had with a computer.
I love this laptop  I love this laptop. Looks good , well built, and very good speed. Needed a 2 usb adapt. for network plug, no problem. Keyboard is nice and windows 8.1 is great, worried about that coming from xp. Price makes this the laptop I was looking for.
Very good service.  Everything fine. thanks for your promptness . Good product
My first month I've been impressed.  Top quality, boots in less than 15 seconds, quality HD, very fast.
Love it! Works great and it's durable  I'm writing this review on my Lenovo! Love it! Works great and it's durable. Only thing is it's a bit bulky but I got past that really quick
It was for my daughter and hasn't had a problem with it
great product, great seller, best price  really happy with this machine, great for my work, really fast core i5, bigest screen. low weight for a machine of 17"
Great laptop for the price. Really smoking fast once I replaced the HDD with a Samsung SSD
The best laptop I've ever had  Awesome laptop! As soon as I took it out of the box, I was shocked at how beautiful it is. The screen is very bright, and everything about it is great! I definitely reccomend!
A++
Great looks, good performance, A very good machine.  I bought this machine because I had a Dell that boke down and had lots of problems with it. This HP performs much better than the Dell I had. It is a bit slower to start but has tons of features, and if you treat it well, it will return the favor. I have no problems at all and it looks very nice. I had several different computers before and all of them stock once in a while. I had the same issue with this one but it has hapened maybe twice since I bought it at the beggining of the year. I recomend it. A 5 star rating product.
Great for gaming.  Bought this refurbished, this laptop is great for gaming! I mostly play high resolution games from Steam and the graphics this laptop puts out is amazing. I've had it for a few months and haven't run into any issues. It was a bit bulkier than I thought it would be, but the pros outweigh this con.
Excellent Product
Very good! Had for months no flaws running strong  Very good! Had for months no flaws running strong! If this one dies if I can't fix it I will buy another from this seller.
It working game so fast!
Happy customer.  Great product and it is so easy to use , the internet access speed is much faster than my laptop with windows 8. Very happy with the purchase. Would totally recommend this product.
Great computer!  Great buy.  Computer works great. Computer Express is the best!
Great laptop  Update (11/1/13): I've been using this heavily since I got it and I still stand by this review. Hope this helps! ---------------------------------------------------------------  I've been wanting to upgrade my laptop for the past year or so, but until this laptop came out I couldn't really find one that matched what I was looking for. I wanted a laptop that was 11-13" since I'm a student and will be travelling with it relatively frequently. I also wanted good battery life since I don't always have access to an outlet. Finally, I wanted a laptop that had decent technical specs and performance. Finding a balance between all three of these facets was difficult but this laptop fits the bill (I'm currently typing on it right now).  Specs: 5/5 With one of Intel's new Haswell processors, I've noticed that Acer has really improved the battery life from their previous iteration of the S7. They've also managed to bump up performance by 10-15% according to recent benchmarks. Finally, the integrated graphics on this particular processor has also been improved slightly from the previous HD 4000 series. These specs are more than enough to run Microsoft office, watch HD video, browse the internet, run lab software, and do light gaming. I leave the more intensive games to my desktop. The SSD is quite snappy-- the boot up time from power button press to desktop is around 5 seconds. This is great as I'm often turning it on and off when I move around.  Screen: 5/5 The touch screen is quite nice at 1080p resolution. The laptop comes with the text set to increased size, but I'm currently running it at 100% size and I can read everything comfortably. The text is crisp and the colors are vibrant. The screen is quite bright. It does have a glossy finish, however, so it will get fingerprints on it if you decide to use the touch screen. I rarely use the touch screen so it's just nice to have in case there's ever any reason I need it in the future.  Sound: 3/5 The speakers are probably one of the laptop's bigger weaknesses. They are somewhat tinny and have very little bass. I use headphones whenever I'm on the laptop though, so this doesn't really affect me. Some Dolby software equalizing does come preinstalled, but I don't find it to be particularly useful.  Keyboard: 4/5 The keyboard has increased travel compared to the previous S7, which is good since it was quite shallow before. The keyboard is nice to type on (I haven't noticed more errors than usual), but Acer did decide to shrink the function keys into the number keys. This was an interesting choice... it makes the keyboard look more clean, but also results in more keys being dual function. If you use Alt-F4 or anything with F# keys, then you'll have to add another key press to those combos-- Alt-F4 becomes Alt-Fn-4 and so on. There are a few other changes to the layout (Esc is now where the tilde key usually is, and the caps lock key is now two keys: caps lock and tilde), but most of the changes are on keys that I don't use so I don't mind as much. You may find yourself having to adjust depending on which keys you use.  Touchpad: 4.5/5 The touchpad is now a Synaptics touch pad, and I find it pretty sensitive and functional. It has multitouch capabilities (pinch to zoom, two finger scrolling, etc.). As far as I know, it doesn't allow for three finger tapping. Otherwise, basic functionality is there and it just works. It can either be press to click or tap to click. There are two unmarked areas at the bottom that correspond to left and right click. Not the most mind-blowing stuff.  Input/Output: 4.5/5 The power button has now been moved so that it is protected by the power cord. The power cord plugs in with a right angle connector, and it folds over the power button. I personally like this change as it prevents me from pressing it by accident. There's one USB 3.0 port on the left and an SD card reader. On the right is the headphone jack, an HDMI port, a USB 3.0 port, and an Acer converter port that allows you to buy an ethernet dongle. It's annoying that there's no ethernet port, but if you were planning on staying on WiFi anyways, then it's not a huge deal. The wi-fi issues of the last iteration seem to be resolved as I haven't had any problems with either disconnecting, connecting or signal strength. The webcam works well, as do the built in microphones.  Battery life: 5/5 Acer has really improved battery life by giving the S7-392 a bigger battery capacity, as well as upgrading to Haswell. I've been able to go the entire day in lab (10-12 hour days) without having to even pull out my charger when I use the laptop intermittently, and under heavy use I can easily get more than enough time (6-7 hours). Haswell really does improve the management of idle power consumption of the processor. The adapter is pretty small compared to other bricks I've owned, and it's not a pain to carry around. There is NOT a mag-safe type connection if you're looking for that. It plugs into the laptop so if you somehow trip over the cord, it will probably pull the laptop off the table depending on what angle it pulls at. Maybe you'll be luckier than I usually am... that's why I'm always extra careful walking around laptops.  Design: 5/5 This is something that is far more subjective, but I find the design to be gorgeous. The gorilla glass 2 cover is beautiful and since it's on a white background, it's harder to see fingerprints than if it were on a black background. The style inside the laptop is very clean and it's clear that Acer has gone for a more simple design aesthetic. There are very few lights blinking on it, which I like. There's one indicator for power, and another for when the laptop is charging. I don't need a hard drive activity, WiFi, or other indicators so I'm glad they kept it simple.  Operating system/install: This is something that people probably find somewhat polarizing. I have no issues with Windows 8. It's a snappier version of Windows 7 and the lack of the "physical" start button in the bottom left doesn't really bother me. Other people will disagree-- regardless, this is a review of the laptop not the operating system so I'm not going to base my review on the OS. However, I will base some of it on the fact that it comes installed with a bunch of programs that I found kind of useless. I immediately uninstalled McAfee antivirus (it comes with a year subscription I believe), a few Norton utilities, some preinstalled games, some Acer programs, and many windows 8 apps that I wasn't interested in. It took around 20 minutes or so.  Overall, I really like this laptop so far. I've only been using it for a week or so but it's been a huge improvement over what I was using before. I appreciate the improvements they've made over the previous model and while there are several aspects that I would change if I could, these don't seem to affect my use of the laptop (though they may affect yours.) Overall it's a quite solid laptop with good build quality and great design. I think it was worth the purchase and I would probably make the same choice if I had to choose a laptop again.
great for streaming and work  Very efficient and fat boot up and shut down time, great for streaming and work.
Best Chromebook!  We bought 3 in 2016. They still work great.  Got another one this Dec 2017 and its great too.  I highly recommend this product.
works nice. The only problems would be the track pad sometimes doesn't register good and the speakers sometimes have a weird noise.
No problems so far
Perfect for on the go "internetting". Honestly to whip it out and take notes real quick, its so perfect.
I love my toshiba chromebook!
Excellent perfomance at a very good price!!!  Excellent computer. I was impressed with the performance offered at a price so good. I recommend this laptop at 100%. The speakers sound quite high. Optimus technology is great allowing you to use the graphics processing power only when needed. This coupled with the turboboost make this laptop an exquisite investment.
I just love this computer.
I love it!  I'v been using my surface book for the past two weeks and am very happy with it.  My last laptop was a Sony Vaio Z22, and just like this laptop, I knew I was overpaying for specs, but I was most interested in form (light/aesthetic) coupled with performance.  I take good care of my laptops so I justify the price by the frequency of use and number of years I plan to use it.  I won't discuss the looks of the machine too much since the pictures above and/or on youtube videos show exactly what it looks like.  To me, it is very macbookesque.  Nice clean lines and classy matte silver color.  Some people complaint about the hinge design, but I don't see a problem with it.  It looks fine, and works great.  People who worry about crumbs and dirt getting in from the hinge area when they throw their laptop in a bag make me wonder who would have crumbs in their bag, or if they do, then why wouldn't they protect an expensive laptop using a simple sleeve?  Anyway, it hasn't been a problem for me.  The keyboard is wonderful.  Roomy and comfortable to use.  The back-lighting makes the keys easy to see.  It's quiet and accurate.  I bought the Cosmo Clear Color See Thru Keyboard Cover Skin -- it is practically invisible and you can't really feel it.  I'm using it only because I seem to have acid fingertips that seem to eat through certain letters on every keyboard I've ever had.  I thought I'd protect this one since this cover is actually comfortable to use.  The screen is fabulous.  Crystal clear.  Exactly what you would expect of really high pixel density screens.  The only drawback has nothing to do with the hardware - some software doesn't scale properly to the new high density monitors in general, which means the windows/icons that you are looking at might appear to be miniscule.  The surface (or perhaps it is Windows 10) comes with a magnifying glass that can help.  Note this is not a problem with every program, just those programs that haven't yet been set up for the newer screens.  Some people complain about screen wobble.  I see no screen wobble when I'm simply typing.  I see the expected wobble when I use my finger on the screen to select things.  There is also a bit of wobble at that moment when you set the laptop down after carrying it by its base - but nothing dramatic.  This brings me to my next point.  I've never had a touch screen before and expected it to be useless during the times it was attached to the keyboard.  I was so wrong.  I very quickly fell into using my finger to select things on the screen automatically.  I'm very happy with speed/performance.  I do a lot of writing/office work/emails, and I haven't run into any problems.  I also look at youtube vids and other streaming media, again with no problem.  I also use Photoshop a lot, and Adobe must have fixed the problems that a lot of people were dealing with, because I have not had any issues.  For ARTISTS using the clipboard mode, I recommend the tablet pro app in the windows store.  Check out the youtubes first, but the app allows you to use gestures or touch bigger on-board buttons (sort of like the virtual keyboard) to do things like select a new color, undo, select a brush, etc.  Using the pen or your finger can be tedious due to having to aim accurately.  I do really like the pen.  I've used a stylus (adonit) on my iPad for drawing, and it seemed slipperier on the iPad. This felt more natural, there was more friction between the screen and the pen (more of a "paper" feel - to the extent possible).  However, I am very new to digital drawing/painting, so I don't feel I can give a full analysis or comparison with other products.  The bottom of the laptop is a little slippery.  It's fine when I'm typing on a desk, but it does take only a slight push against the side to move it across the surface of the table.  I also use it on a bed tray that is made of plastic.  On that plastic surface, the laptops slips a lot.  I just placed the protective packing sheet (that was on the keyboard when it arrived) onto that surface and fixed the problem - the laptop stays in place.  The trackpad works very well, is comfortable to use, and very accurate.  I ordinarily use a mouse, but I've found myself using the trackpad more in the same way I've been using the touchscreen more.  My guess is that these features work so well that I may one day ditch the mouse.  I'm easily getting 9 hours battery life with the tablet attached to the keyboard.  This is when I'm using the laptop to write/surf/check mail.  The battery time is significantly less with photoshop usage.  Issues:  If you tend to lean down on the laptop, pressing the area above your wrists onto the keyboard, the edge of the keyboard is quite sharp and may cut into your skin (push into your skin) and be uncomfortable after a while.  I've only had this issue when I had the laptop on a higher desk so I was resting my arms on it.  I usually have the keyboard level much lower, and do not rest my arms on it - so this isn't a problem for me.  Sometimes it does not "wake up" fast after I've left for a while and it has gone into sleep or hibernation mode.  Switch user is sometimes significantly slower than on my years older laptop.  All in all, I'm happy with my purchase.  I'll update this if I run into new issues and/or find new good things to say.
incentive award  this will make a excellent award! these came boxed very nice and arrived as requested/promised. I can not imagine someone not liking to receive this
Uh, it's great  It's so fast and does everything I need. Too bad I can't use Skype or Steam on Chrome OS. I used crouton to dual boot ubuntu 12.04 and so far everything is working great. Doing this allows for some nice offline usage. Easy to use.
GREAT Computer except it does not have a dvd /cd drive
Amazing Laptop, Even better Value  I bought this laptop to to do my CAD work while on the go.  I have to say that this machine handles SolidWorks better than my desktop ever did.  I find my self using the laptop instead of the desktop.  Some key things that should be done to the laptop after you buy it is up grade the RAM.  This puppy can handle 32GB!!!!! Also, add a solid state drive.  My laptop literally take 3-4 seconds to boot up.  Its quicker to reboot the computer that to resume, crazy right?  One this that you should know, this laptop is a beast.  It's heavy but very solid.  I feel that it will last awhile before i need to replace it.  As for the price, I paid $800 which is a steal.  Comparable computers from best buy or Fry's would have sold for $2000+ and they don't even have the 2GB quadro video card needed for the professional applications I run.  In short, get it.
Great ultrabook!  Hello everyone, I actually felt obligated to write a review about this Zenbook, it's fantastic!  My wife's netbook was stolen so I bought this one as a xmas gift, I think she'll be realle happy with it.  I'm a really techie guy, I'm constantly reading about technology and I also work on the field, so I know a thing or two about computers. At first, like many others, I had concerns about spending 1300+ on a computer which got many bad reviews, especially about the trackpad, but I can say that none of those are true, at least for me.  Of course it's inevitable to compare this to the Macbook Air, which I've worked on too, but I actually find this one to be a superior offer, so forgive me if I keep comparing the two.  Ok, first things first, the one I got is UX31E-DH72, it has the core i7 and 256GB SSD. From what I've read the difference in performance with the DH53, which has the core i5, is not really noticeable for the price difference, but I haven't used the DH53, so I really cannot make that assesment.  I wish the description of the product would be more detailed, especially about the items included in the box, because at first I didn't know about the adapters and I was actually going to buy a LAN adapter and the miniVGA-VGA adapter. Luckily, on the unboxing videos you can find on youtube, you will see that they are both provided in the box, which seems like a big plus to me. So, in the box you get the carrying bag, which is nice, a cleaning cloth (useful), the USB to LAN adapter, the miniVGA to VGA adapter (as well as a little carrying bag for both of them), the power adapter and the usual papers.  The box is really pretty, and I guess we would all agree that they kind of went Apple on those. Like I said, nice packaging.  The laptop itself is beautiful, made of aluminum, like you have surely read elsewhere, and it is delightfully light. I can really see someone taking this baby around all day with no complaints.  The laptop comes preinstalled with Windows 7 Home Premium x64, I went through the usual first startup just to test everything and see for myself if the trackpad had any issues out of the box. I'm glad to report that it worked flawlessly, not jumpy or anything, it actually felt great. My zenbook came with bios version 2.06, I was prepared to update because I read that all the trackpad issues were resolved with the update, but like I said, I had no issues with version 2.06. I still upgraded to bios 2.09, which is the latest available from Asus. I guess I should mention that my Zenbook has the Elantech trackpad, don't know if the Sentelic would be any different.  I had previously donwloaded all drivers and apps from Asus site because I was going to perform a clean install anyway, so I did. I had to do a clean install because I needed the OS in spanish, and I prefer to install the apps I need the way I like them. In my experience Asus laptops usually come with some bloatware, but that doesn't seem to be the case with the Zenbook.  So, all the windows updates, drivers, apps and everything installed smoothly. The laptop is very quick and responsive, and I think the Solid State Drive really makes a difference. The computer starts fast from cold boot in a breeze, and it is AMAZING with the Instant On app. Instant On makes it wake up in under two seconds, and I love it, it saves battery too, so you don't have to carry around the AC adapter everywhere. What you have to do is get in the habit of closing the laptop when you are not using it, and open it when you need it again. With Instant On you are back in your desktop in 2 secs, so there is no need to have the computer running all the time.  The keyboard seems great to me too. I agree that sometimes you miss a key stroke, and you have to press a little more, but it's not something that bothers me, like I said, it's a rare happening.  The screen resolution is great: 1600x900, so it is exactly widescreen (16:9), and I've enjoyed seeing movies, pictures and working on it. Since the screen is 13.3" some might find that using 1600x900 makes the letter too small, but that's not the case for me, I like it a lot.  Sound is fabulous, for a laptop that is, it usually isn't as rich or loud on laptops, it sounds great in this.  The trackpad is awesome. I really cannot stress enough the fact that it is not at all like some descriptions out there. The multi gestures are great, you can pinch to zoom in or out, you can tap to clik or right click, you can go back and forth in a browser or book, you can scroll up and down and sideways, you can tap and drag or click and drag, you can go directly to the desktop or bring up the open windows to change apps; all with finger gestures, and being so responsive as it is I haven't had any issues with it.  And now for the Macbook Air comparisons, I find it that this involves a lot of personal taste. If you are an apple guy then you'd prefer the Mac, and if you are a Windows guy I'm sure you'll prefer the Zenbook. For the sake of comparison I'm gonna compare the DH72 with the equivalent Macbook air, that is with a Mac with a core i7, 256 GB SSD, 4 GB RAM.  They are both really light and thin, and both made of aluminum, so like I said it is a matter of personal preference. The Asus, like I said, is beautiful, but then again also is the Macbook air, I personally think that the Air looks a little better.  The screen is definitely better in the Zenbook, 1600x900 as opposed to 1440x900 in the Air. I find that viewing angles are similar on both.  Sound is better on the Zenbook.  I think the keyboard is about the same, but if you are really picky about it then I guess you would find the Air better.  I prefer the trackpad in the Zenbook, not only it feels good, I'm a Windows guy and I need my right click, it really bothers me that you have to hold CTRL and click on a Mac. Tapping with both fingers in the Zenbook is great for righ clicking.  I think the ports are better on the Zenbook, 1xUSB3, 1xUSB2, miniVGA (adapter included), miniHDMI (buy cable separately), and Mic/Headphones.  The webcam is better in the Mac, this is really a weak point in Asus, they use the 0.3 MP camera in most of their laptops. And also the backlit keyboard is nice on the Mac, Zenbook's keyboard is not backlit.  And regarding performance, I really find it dumb to compare the two because one uses Windows and the other OS X, we all know that apple lovers say the OS is much better, it doesn't have any viruses and blah, blah. I actually think OS X is a great OS but I prefer Windows, again a matter of personal taste.  And finally, most of all, I just wouldn't spend the extra bucks for a Mac, being that I can get something better or equal for a lot less. If you want a Macbook Air similar as the DH72, you would have to buy the adapters for VGA, and LAN and you would pay about USD 1800, those USD 400 make a big difference to me, like I said, I wouldn't pay the extra money for the "Apple" experience.  Ok, just my two cents, hope you find it helpful.
I have joined the ROG  You haven't joined yet? great buy and great laptop. Become a ROG and purchase this laptop very worth it! I am a ROG(republic of gamers).
Great Computer Store  If you are looking for an inexpensive laptop,  that runs very well for a refurbished computer,  this is the place to get it.  I bought Dell E6500 4G 500GB in 2015, and I was able to work from home on it. I'm looking for an additional laptop and I'm looking at theirs.  You won't be disappointed.  I give credit where credit is due.
Great kids computer
Great item as describe. used but still in good condition, cleaner then expected.
IT DOES IT ALL  Writting a review 1 year later from this computer, ha. The laptop has performed exceptionally well and Lenovo's customer service have been very helpful in numerous ocations. Strongly recommend anyone to go for this option. I use it for work, gaming, personal entertainment and movies. It obviously doesn't run the latest videogames in ultra quality, but it does a preety good job mantaining performance at optimal levels in videogames such as company of heroes 2, league of legends, starcraft 2. and the AMD A10 Elite Quad Core it comes with really delivers.  Overall 9/10
WoooHooo!  Man I wanted a cheap laptop soooo bad! Thats what I needed! Now I can upgrade the ram and add Window 7 to it and I'm good! Shippmen took a while but was Extremely worth the wait. Like Brand spanking new!! Thanks!!
Perfect  I bought this for my dv7-4280us which also had the broken hinge issue. I haven't yet installed it (waiting on a replacement video cable), but it's the correct part and quite a bit cheaper than directly from HP.
super glad I got it  I needed a cheap and fairly light Macbook for a trip. I just needed to use it as a 'middle man' to transfer data off my camera and memory cards while on a trip recently/ This Macbook did the trick; super glad I got it.
... a year now and the laptop is still working perfect and fast  been a year now and the laptop is still working perfect and fast!
Just could not know how to work it
Absolutely excellent. No problems.  It is a great little computer. It is blazing fast for internet searches and any kind of Office based work you are trying to complete. I generally have at least five tabs open and Word of PowerPoint running at the same time, because I use this device for school work and research, and it is not bogged down at all. It is extremely aesthetically pleasing, with just a slight hint of gold and nice sparkle to it. The device is extremely light, I am more than confident I could throw it like a frisbee to an extreme distance. If you are looking for the portability of a tablet, but don't wanna pay hundreds more for a touch screen and no physical keyboard, this is the device you've been dreaming of.
Daughter loves it
great product excellent delivery
it's a true powerhouse  This one met and exceeded my expectations, it's great for gaming and recording music. It's definitely worth the price tag. You can play most games at high to ultra resolution with its GTX 965m. I've yet to add RAM or a secondary hard drive / SSD. With one month of use I haven't experienced any drawbacks. Windows 10 makes it all the better, definitely a must have for anyone that wants a high quality computer.
Great computer but it will take me a bit to get used to the windows 10.
The best performing chromebook for the money  This is not a laptop - it is a small, cheap device that let's my kids learn and play online.  I chose this chromebook over other cheap ones because it has a real computer processor and not a smart phone processor so it performs really well even when loading the largest google documents / presentations.  I also chose a chromebook over a real laptop because I don't want my kids installing viruses and messing it up all the time.  I spend no time cleaning them off and they each have exactly what they need to get their school work done and nothing more.  You can also print to any printer hooked up to a PC running special software though I recommend getting a printer with wireless capabilities built in if you don't already have one.  Brother Printer HL3140CW is a great color laser printer with built in wireless at a good price.  Search for 'Google Cloud Print' to learn more
love it
VAIO VGN-NR460E  This is an excellent laptop for business or student.  THe screen is crystal clear with vibrant colors.  Also, this model processes very fast even with multiple windows open.  If you're a 3D gamer, this probably wouldn't suffice but for working with office products & on the web it is an excellent choice.
Great little laptop!  I bought this laptop primarily because it had a video card that wasn't integrated. Before I even booted it up the first time, I installed a brand new 256 GB SSD drive from Crucial and upgraded to 8 GB of RAM. I installed a fresh copy of windows 7 and then downloaded and installed all the necessary drivers from the ASUS website. All I can now is "Wow!" This is a fast laptop. SSD is definitely the future. I actually really like the keyboard and trackpad on this as well. My only complaint is with the monitor. It's not bad but doesn't compare with how bright and clear my last Dell XPS monitor was before it started to die due to overheating issues. This is a great laptop for the price and is made even better with upgrades. It's not quite an ultrabook but it's close. Love it.
great!! go ahead and buy it  great !! go ahead and buy it.
Meets all my expectations!  At the moment (had the laptop for two days), the laptop meets all my expectations.  The laptop came in excellent condition, and all parts are functioning correctly.  Came installed with Windows 7, and includes Windows 8 upgrade discs.  Battery life is solid (a little over 5 hours for normal use). Keyboard is very nice to type on, feels natural. Speed is good, no complaints there. The laptop feels solid as a rock, I expect the hardware/screen will not be breaking anytime soon. The laptop speakers can be quite loud, which is a plus : )
Better than a laptop for basic Internet use  This is my favorite of any recent purchases I've made! I had a laptop that stopped consistently holding onto the wifi signal, so I got this Chromebook so I could get onto the internet and use social media, do some blogging etc. and it's absolutely perfect for these things for a small fraction of the price of a decent laptop. It boots up super quickly, my wireless mouse works perfectly with it, and I have zero complaints about the graphics, the sounds or the performance. A+ product.
Nice laptop  Much better than expected.  Very lightweight and easy to use.  Boots up quickly.  For a Mac user, this is very easy to use.
My wife loves it !!!
Very good notebook but BEWARE!  First off let me say this is a very good notebook but there is an advertising caveat: The Amazon offered "bundled" memory, Corsair 8GB, has been shown in several cases to be incompatible with this model. The problem manifests itself in a hard lockup and in at least two cases screen corruption with severe jitter.  With the exception of this glitch, which is not Asus's fault or responsibility, this is a top notch notebook for the price.  I have not had the time to test all the feature's (I've heard complaints about the wireless card) but so far everything is working equal to or better than expected.  I don't like laptops/notebooks as a rule but I will have to admit to liking this one.
It's as rugged as tank and nearly as heavy  I purchased this laptop in April 2006 and after 9 years it is still running great. It has literally been around the world, flew in black hawks in combat, been in C-130's and many military vehicles. Despite some claims about a weak power connector I have had no issues because I do not abuse the connector by applying side forces on it. It has always been transported in my Targus backpack with the screen facing away from my back. The fluorescent bulb finally failed in 2013 and I decided to replace the whole screen for under $50. I also upgraded the processor to AMD 4000+ in early 2007 and applied a high end thermal paste because this laptop does run hot with it's desktop processor. I also replaced the memory shortly after getting it with 2GB of DDR 400. I also replaced the hard drive with a larger and faster 5400 rpm 120GB from WD that had failed in 2013 after 7 years. The old 80 GB Seagate is now back in it working great. The CONS: 1. It is heavy but it is not flimsy and failure prone like the newer lightweight laptops. 2. It runs hot with it's desktop CPU but that also made it very powerful in it's heyday. 3. HP support sucks as does Toshiba, Western Digital, Microsoft and many other computer industries.
Exceeded expectations  Really love this laptop.  This is my first Chromebook so I was hesitant to buy it.  But I have no regrets.  Fast.  Light.  Well built.  Never spending more for a Windows laptop again.
i love it, its as shown on the picture
FOR BROWSING THE WEB  Perfect for browsing the internet and would be perfect for download if you have external drive.
If you are a writer, buy this!  If you are a writer or simply an avid web-browser, the 2013 Macbook Air is one of the best laptops on the market. I love how light the computer is (you can definitely carry it in one hand and type with the other.)  While there are faster laptops for the price, this one has the best keyboard that I have ever used, and since I am a journalist, a good keyboard is quite important.  Not everyone loves Macs for various reasons, but as someone that has always used PCs, this is a great laptop. Getting used to the OS may be a little bit annoying but always remember that you can use Parallels if you simply like the Macbook's hardware but would rather use Windows OS.  All in all, there were some software/hardware issues in the first batch of units but now that those are fixed, I've never been happier with a laptop in my life.  - Seth Fitzgerald, Journalist [...] @SethAFitzgerald
Low In Price - High In Value  Happy camper here. My first portable computer. Yeah, I still have (and love) my dumb flip phone. I'm a bona fide luddite, so Bluetooth and other techie stuff is of no interest to me. I will probably (and happily) never find out half of what this thing is capable of. My "refurbished" laptop was shipped priority mail and arrived in perfect condition. Nothing about this unit says 'used.' It came with a fully charged battery, which was good for about 90 minutes of use. Not bad at all. It came with my preferred operating system, Windows 7 Professional, and it is as fast and furious as my desktop at home. Enjoy.
awesome  love my macbook air, would recommend people to buy. very satisfied with what i purchased. thank you very much j
Great for Ubuntu install, very portable, SSD compatible.  Old machine but is a great coder machine for Ubuntu, keyboard ultra comfortable for the fast coder. Upgraded mine with an SSD with no issues. A X210 or X250 are a bit better, I have them both. But this is a great machine for the price. Solid and very portable. If you are a Ubutu person this is your machine.
Outstanding product & service!  What can I say, It's a great laptop.  Its good to travel with and the price was right.  Toshiba's customer service is second to none!
Dell Inspiron i7559-763BLK  Received two days ago. first thing I did was upgrade to Windows 10 1511, loaded dell drivers. Even though it has an AC wireless it is bottom of the range, but still works well. There have been many reviews that complain about accuracy of screen, honestly if you are doing professional work get a workstation. The  fact that one can get a laptop with these features at this price is amazing. It hits all the right spots for it's price, CPU, Video adaptor, SSD storage, lighted keyboard, multi-touch trackpad. The build quality is fine, rather have good components than an aluminum 1 piece shell. The  aesthetics are neither garish nor plain nice design. If you have problems with blurry windows, change scaling to 100%, by default it is at  125% which causes some windows to be blurry. I used my last Dell for over 8 years, I hope to use this one for same length of time.  I play a few games but looking forward to "No Man's Sky" and others in that vein. Diablo 3 did have small problem but was Diablo's setup  easily rectified. Pros: CPU latest one, quad core Video Nvidia 960M (even though NVidia has problems with native support of DirectX12) Screen and resolution just fine, screen is clear and bright. Boot SSD (very fast) Added another SSD in spare slot will suite my needs. Cons: Trackpad has no setup or selection for features (shows as HID Mouse device) Wireless is bottom of line AC, my old Dual Band N connected at higher rate. Full size Keyboard move positions of keys (from what I was used to), so will take some getting used to. To sum it up, If you have limited funds and want a good laptop, the price to value (for me at least) is excellent with this laptop. I am thoroughly pleased I purchased this laptop.
Perfectly portable. Easier to carry than most of my textbooks.
Best buy  I am pleased with the purchase, an excellent choice and Prime service was the best . The computer was what I expected and specifications were correct service was very good on time, packaging estubo very well and the computer came with no hits.
Great Product for the Price!  This is an excellent product for the price. I've purchased two of these so far, and I continue to recommend them to friends who need an affordable, reliable machine.
Love it! It's really fast.
Great value  Awesome.  It takes some time to get used to looking for apps instead of downloading programs.  It is amazing how many apps are available.  Beautiful color, extremely fast.  Lightweight and a nice size.  My daughter who has had a MAC BOOK for years can't believe how great this is for 1/5 the price:)
I love this particular model cause it works great  I bought it five (5) years ago and its still works as new. Very rugged and efficient... I love this particular model cause it works great!
Excellent
damn good computer.  i bought this computer because the price was right. what i didn't expect was how nice and new this computer was. i bought a refurbished computer but when i got it it looked and worked like brand new. i have only had it a couple days but its way faster than i expected. this is a great laptop. i would recommend it as it stands now but we will see if it lasts well.
For $379 you cannot go wrong  This is a powerhouse and the most bang for your buck.  Really enjoying it.  Windows 8 is awful, but installed Start8 for $5 and it by-stepped the whole issue.  Not too much bloatware which is nice also.
I love My macbook air  I can't add a lot to whats already been said about this awesome laptop other than when I first saw this laptop I wanted it and haven't been disappointed in its performance I have had the 13inch model with 2gb of ram and 128gb of hard drive space I thought that I would never use another laptop brand other than sony but I can say that I will never own another laptop unless its an apple I really don't see how apple can make the macbook air any better but I can't wait to see what they come up with next !!!!!
Very nice machine  I have been very pleased with the speed, durability and ease of use.  As long as you realize that a chromebook is not a laptop but a Goigle system you will be happy with this chromebook.
Excellent product  First of all, incredible computer. For the price at which I bought it- $110 it's proven to be fully functioning and great. It truly is an excellent computer for High School or even casual coffee shop papers. Good speakers as well. The only thing is the battery life. As I first got it, it was excellent, but as it got older and older it started to wear down. I'm not sure about the ten hour battery life but it sure does it's purpose for two thirds of the day for sure. Great product, I will probably buy again.
The notebook everyone can use out of the box.  Perfect little notebook. No problems and no complaints. Huge bargain. This is computer I have spent 30 years waiting for.
Great little package.  I cannot say enough good about this little Chromebook.  Admittedly it does mostly online streaming and not even from its own screen....It mostly provides video to a 24in monitor through a DVI to HDMI cord i use at work to keep myself entertained.  I use a Blu-tooth keyboard and the little bugger stays clammed up for the entirety of my 12 hour shift.  From a full charge it goes all night long, cycling between video, music streaming and Social media.  The times i do use the provided monitor i am very pleased with the picture.  I recommend this Chromebook as a great streaming solution for someone not looking to spend a lot of money....the HDMI out is a great feature.
Great spec and value for money.  Great spec and value for money. My users complained that pressure-sensitive touchpad may be too sensitive and unusual but they eventually got used to it.
Quite satisfied  Completely satisfied with this chromebook. The screen is bright and the resolution is quite satisfactory for 14 inch screen. Speakers, touchpad and keyboard are also fine.
I like it, it serves its purpose
Fantastic  The Chromebook is pretty amazing! Some of the features take a little getting used to, but once you figure them out it is wonderful little piece of technology. Small and lightweight. Holds a good charge. Excellent display. Unique Google features and aps. Completely silent when in operation and doesn't get overheated like a traditional laptop. Makes it excellent for watching movies and tv shows, Facebooking, shopping, etc. Would definitely recommend this item to others.
Best investment EVER!  Whoever says this laptop over heats or has any problems is lying! I was worried about the reviews I saw stating that the laptop was bad. However when I got it I was jus impressed with how AWESOME it is. runs warhead with everything on enthusiast without lag unless you are running your laptop on battery. So yeah.. this thing can run ANYTHING no problems!  Pros: 1tb 500+500gb. great feel to it. all the specs. it brought the awesome ASUS backpack that targus made. the mouse. Though I don't use it since I have a naga razer mouse. boots windows REALLY FAST light under the keys is just awesome. I could keep on going with the great stuff this laptop has.  only cons: one of the rubber pads underneath the laptop fell off. Nothing serious.  If you need a gaming computer and a laptop for college or something then look no further this is the GAMING portable device you need.
Just what was expected!
Great Laptop runs good, its light, and It has great sound!
ASUS TP500L initial reaction: Fabulous + VOLUME UPDATE  Initial Review upon 4 days of use: I went through 3 different Laptops in search of my new Notebook PC (to replace a great Dell Inspiron that I have had for 5 years).  So, first question:  Why not go with another Dell? First, Dell has been slipping lately in Customer Satisfaction.  But more importantly, I was looking for a convertible notebook... something that could flip completely around and allow tablet-like operation.  At present, Dell does not have a good one of those that I am aware of.  ASUS has been creating great laptops for the last many years and they keep getting better, so I had to look at ASUS in my selection process.  I also looked at 4 other notebooks in my process (5 if you count the Flex).  Before the ASUS: First I looked at an i7 Sony FIT, just because it was a great price and better specs. My judgement after a week of use: Let's just say no...nothing seemed to work right with this laptop... and since it was not a convertible (2-in-1) I moved past it quickly, despite the great price for the i7. The performance was sub par and useability terrible.  Next, I seriously considered the Lenovo Flex. You can get some great deals on the Flex, and it is a well made, beautiful and powerful line. Only problem?  It FLEXES only so far... so it can NOT fold back on itself... one option I really wanted  for my unique needs.  I just don't see the benefit of a 270 degree flexible PC.  I played with a friends, was impressed, but it gave me no benefit and was not a true convertible.  Third, I purchased the Sony Vaio Flip... a great little 14 inch wonder that is sleek, gorgeous, and utterly unremarkable in performance.  The "flip" mechanism was super neat, and shows great design.  People commented on the design and beauty.  It's a stunner.  The problem after two weeks?  Horribly loud fan, problematic USB and port placement, pedestrian performance, and the killer, the saggy, mushy keyboard, that caused typing to be a chore.  (The keyboard looked great with a back lit keys, but it was impossible to type for any length of time).  The Sony Vaio FLip went FLOP and I returned it.  I really wanted to like it, I couldn't.  I did look at the gorgeous Lenovo Yoga 2.  Hey, that has got to be the best convertible 2-in-1 out there!  But the HIGH PRICE TAG (north of $1K) and lack of size (13.3 screen is the best size you will get... no 14 or 15 inch screens) made the choice of the Lenova Yoga 2 impossible for me to consider.  I would recommend it to those with better bank accounts and those who love the excellent styling, super thin and light weight, and fast performance.  That leaves us number 5:  The Asus Transformer Flip.  ASUS TRANSFORMER FLIP: ASUS is an outstanding brand, and when the Sony showed its true colors (infamous  "sony" failings), the ASUS was really my number 1 choice.  This model would need to be considered nearly a budget consideration compared to most of the other convertibles I considered.  Yet, it is clearly superior in every way to the Sony Vaio, even tho the vaio cost $300 more.  The ASUS is clearly a top-level contender.  It is fast, it is a dream to type on (no, this model doesn't have the backlit keyboard).  But the keyboard has the perfect "travel" for keys and is firm with the Aluminum casing.  The fan is quiet and this thing runs cool.  It is speedy, at least compared with the same spec'd Vaio and faster than the i7 Fit. The one Terabyte drive is so much faster than the 500 GB hard drive on the  vaio. (Twice the hard drive size and twice as speedy) And the wifi card seems to be substantially better as well (no wifi issues...and my internal wifi card is the mediatek...so those issues must have been resolved with the driver update).  The FLIP mechanism (hinge) is sturdy and was well tested before being put into production.  Touch screen super responsive and accurate, unlike Vaio.  And the touchpad (next to keyboard) is so much better than the Sony's impossible touch pad.  Now, I still like having a mouse for serious work, but it is nice to have a workable touchpad.  Comes with Bluetooth, as well.  Comes with WIndows 8.1 and updated drivers.  Now, I must confess, I downloaded the free Classic Shell from CNET's site... and I love being able to have a classic START BUTTON when I want it... need it. I heard we are to expect Windows 8.2 will have a real start button again!  I love having the brilliant 15.6" screen, and at a full 1080P... beautiful.  Cons:  None thus far. Well, it is not as thin and light as the Lenova Yoga 2 units are.  I will try to update this from time to time as I learn more about this impressive notebook.  Update October 2014:  Still love this notebook! Wonderful pc.  A pleasure to use.  I will say that if you want to use this as a true tablet, know that weight will be an issue.  My tablet like use of this great PC alway's keeps it on a desk, so not a problem for me.  If you want to carry everwhere, try the Yoga. Or, I have a super lite tablet when that is what I need....This notebook is my daily work PC, it still shines with all 5 stars!  As of January 29, 2015, I am still very pleased with my purchase. Since I take this with me to meetings and presentations, I still get comments on this Asus Transformer.  They love the design, the vibrant screen, the great viewing angles, the FLIP design, of course,  and the performance. It has been a great purchase for me because of the many ways I use this notebook.  I did pick up a inexpensive "compatible" power charger (from Amazon) to leave at work (about an hour away) so that when I leave in the AM, I simply grab my Asus, slide it in sleeve, and go. The battery life has been great, but just having that back up charger available means I don't have to ever worry...and I don't have to transport the charger unless on serious travel assignments.  Update: Feb. 15 2015: Cons: On my Asus, the volume level at max seems to go down over time.  Well, it has never been loud at max volume. The other day I tried listening to the same video on my laptop and my tablet (Kindle hdx) and the tablet was significantly louder.  If I cannot get a fix for this somehow,  this could be a reason for lowering one star.  Do others notice this problem?  Cons UPDATE 4/23/15 Volume problem?  Found this simple, neat fix for my volume problem. Understand that the steps below may be slightly different on your laptop, but it will make things louder so that it is very usable.  Right click on your white speaker icon in the taskbar, choose "Volume Control Options" (if you don't see that, try "devices") On the playback tab, highlight or put a checkmark in box of  "Realtek High Definition Audio-Default Device" and Click OK. That should bring up new window, if it doesn't, then right-click on task bar speaker icon again and choose "Playback Devices" Realtek window will now appear. Click "Properties" box -- another window will appear Choose the [Enhancements] tab and you will get a selection of choices Scroll thru the choices available to the very bottom one "Loudness Equalization" and check the box, then click apply.  You should immediately hear the difference.  It was quite substantial on my ASUS TP500L.  This is great! The above "fix" was on the ASUS Forums...so apparently some of their laptops have this Loudness feature off when shipped... and based on other reviews of the LP500L from ASUS, I would guess most are in need of this quick fix. JJ
Just perfect for my bussy college life  Awsome. Durable, high quality, arrives on time, really ligth and sleek. Just perfect for my bussy college life.
I've always had Macs but I was tired of the pricetags and had heard good things about this little laptop  This replaced a stolen Macbook Pro. I've always had Macs but I was tired of the pricetags and had heard good things about this little laptop, so decided to give it a shot. (Actually received a sympathy card from a friend who's a die-hard Mac guy and couldn't believe I was jumping ship....)  I am so happy with the Acer. Everything I use a laptop for -- e-mail, Web surfing, social media, composing documents, listening to music -- is easy. I don't do stuff like spreadsheets, but there's an app for that if you do. It keeps a charge for a long time, the screen is beautifully clear and easy to read, the 11" size more than adequate. I had wondered if the keyboard would feel small, but it's very generous. And after the Macbook I love the barely-there weight of this thing on my knees. Not to mention the oh my god lovely price!!!
Good Build, Better performance, and Cheap... a Laptop with Best of three.....  This is best laptop at this range. They Touch pad is bit hard to handle as they have put buttons directly under touch pad, it would have been better if they had removed the touch sensitive from buttons, as sometimes it make difficult, but once you get used to it, not a big problem.  Runs smooth, good processing power with graphics....  I love it as i just bought it for $579 which I think, is lowest price ever I can get it for any other laptop with this configuration range.  I have one more Acer laptop, and i liked that as well as it was having very good processing power, but was bit delicate, I guess, they have made this time design more roubust and looks more sturdy, I would say this is no less than Dell which I think is build good.  I guess, for cheap and better processing with now good build, this laptop should top on the list....
Great purchase for my middle school son.
Nice low $ computer  I didn't buy from Amazon got from newegg 1 year ago It has been great I use for mail some you tube watching no problems with it and run just great for a low dollar computer Its not a business computer remember If u want for games and business buy a high dollar one!
If you can afford it - buy it  The size the speed the quality the weight everything about this computer Iis amazing!  If you can afford it. Buy it!
Well worth the money  Great machine!!  Had a startup Windows question and customer service responded by the next morning and completely satisfied my concern!!
Dell Latitude D630  I had a D630 before this and the nVIDIA chipset went bad (common problem). It was cheaper to buy another one, and it was worth it. It said that it would only have a 60GB hard drive in it but mine came with a 160GB hard drive, and Windows 7! Thanks jpawlyk!
Review Long Time Coming  Sorry so late in giving this  a rating.  It is a wonderful product.  I am still using it and typing this review on it right not as a matter of fact.  It is very well made and have not had any problems with it.  My previous laptop was also a HP, and I was very pleased with it also.  This one is even better made.
so happy with my dell!
great monitor and functions
the good old days of IT  Ah memories!  This laptop is the real deal, back when laptops were sturdy and useful.  If you have old gear, which requires a serial port connection, this is a great addition to your tool chest.  If you just want a cheap laptop to run any program without intensive graphic requirements, this is it.
awesome great purchase
Excellent  It is an excellent piece of design product worth buying this product ...!. I highly recommend it. The whole buying process very good and the product arrived undamaged.
Works great and a great price!  Windows 8 takes a bit to understand but it has worked well.  The computer is everything that I wanted.  Quick enough processor for my use and screen is very clear.
It Is a Great Laptop!!  This is a great laptop, especially for me. The wifi and internet connections work great, and the sound and video also works great. The only thing that I see wrong with it is the aluminum finish. It chips easier then a basic laptops finish. Other then that minor thing, it is a great laptop for college students like myself, it is also a good laptop for your basic internet searches or creating pages for work or school.
great great great  best android i have had so far no joke
Perfect Linux Machine  I got my fiance the version of this machine that doesn't have a built in optical drive for Christmas.  We spent a month trying to figure out the mess that is Windows 8.  Finally, I asked her if she wanted me to just install a Linux distro on it.  She gave me the go ahead and has been happily computing ever since.  Flash forward another couple of months and I was in the market for a new laptop for myself.  I decided, based on my experience with my fiance's machine to go with the Asus X550CA.  As soon as I received it, I took the back off it, removed the Windows 8 HD and plopped in a SSD I had laying around.  I then booted off a thumb drive with my Linux distro of choice and installed.  ! Never once had to have to even look at Windows on this machine!  The 4 GB of RAM supplied in the machine is more than adequate but, never one to let sleeping dogs lie, I found a 4 GB stick laying around and upped the total RAM to 8 GB.  Now we're talking!  However, I found out that this machine allows for expansion of up to an 8 GB stick.  I quickly placed my order and once received, maxed out the total RAM in this machine to 12 GB!  Holy smokies!  With 12 GB RAM, the Intel integrated graphics can take whatever I throw at them.  The only things I don't like, If I can really even say that, is I wish I could've gone with a core i5 or i7.  However, the i3 with all the RAM I threw at it is more than enough.  I'm not computing lunar orbits here.  Also, with the Linux distro, I had to find a fix for getting wifi working.  Not a big deal though.  Ubuntu Forums had a fix that took 30 seconds.  Things I do like about it.  The build quality is really good.  When I swapped out HDs, I was surprised to find an all metal drive carriage/heat shield holding the drive in it's bay.  The laptop I took the SSD out of used a cheap tin foil heat shield.  The thing I possibly like the very most is...IT'S RED!!!  Very sexy, good looking laptop.  The screen is wide and clear.  Bang for buck, I can't really find any fault with this machine...once I put a usable operating system on it.  I would recommend this machine to anyone looking for a mostly out of the box Linux compatible laptop.  I would not, however, recommend it if you want to run Windows 8.
Works like a dream  This is a really good laptop for its price. The touchscreen works amazing as well as the computer itself. It loads pages fast on the internet, and if you like to play games like me, then this works good for that too, even games like The Forest (with some lag). Finally I want to say that the battery on this laptop is about 4 hours.
everything was just as expected.
amazing
So far so good fast and simple to set up
Great condition.  A happy consumer.
It's a Chromebook. If you are not familiar with the differences you may find it awkward at the beginning. However, iot is fast and works exactly as it is meant to.
and it fits great in my medical bag  Loving my light weight computer ... I make house calls for a living, and it fits great in my medical bag.
An Awesome Gaming and Enterntainment Laptop  I have been using the laptop for almost 2 years now.  Believe me or not, this laptop has not disappointed me even for once. Everything just works smooth. In this time span there hasn't been even one hang-time while using it.  I Play heavy games on it. GTA IV and Latest GTA V works smooth. This laptop has proved its mettle in Gaming Arena.  For Entertainment have a great set of speakers which compliment a medium sized room pretty well. You can connect the Home theater system and it will support it as well.  For the battery, I bought extended battery of 9 cells and it last 4 hours on heavy gaming and movies. and almost 8-9 hours working on internet.  The keyboard is standard full size 108 keys. Easy comfortable position of the same when typing. one drawback doesn't have back-lit keys. But that doesnt hampers its functioning.  The Trackpad it huge and you have to make setting so its less sensitive. I used a carbon fiber vinyl on it. It looks great and solves the extra sensitivity issue as well.  Screen is matt finished anti-glare one. Its huge and crisp clear. You have to manage the brightness mode for charging and non charging mode. Also you can configure it in sun to high brightness and it works great.  Webcam has a clear quality and it is HD no doubt about it.  Small details as ports and card reader everything works just fine. Imagine almost 2 years of usage and not even once called acer support that my product is giving some issue.  Over all the Laptop has everything you need to get in a Gaming and Entertainment laptop. Working on this laptop of course that's smooth as butter. It stands for every single penny you invest on it.  Awesome product Acer!!
Computer arrived on time and worked perfectly!
5 stars for me, maybe 4 stars for others  As an Information Technology professional (20 years) I have used a variety of computing devices, some for personal use with my personal expectations and intentions in mind, and many more devices in a professional capacity.  I tend to average about five years in between personal computer replacements so in some respect I'm not as difficult to please as some might be, since an upgrade is always going to be appreciated which should be considered when reading my review.  Also, my device usage intentions are not in the area of high-end graphics or gaming, rather my predominate usage tends to be centered around exchanging email messages, reading, writing and testing code and watching an occasional video.  On the other hand, as I do have a diversity of experiences with a variety of laptops and other devices, I am particularly observant of subtle nuances and variations in capabilities and performance.  I've found the Sony VAIO Fit/Flip 14 (model SVF14N11CXB) to be above and beyond my expectations with some of the pros being:  (1) the Windows 8.1 rapid boot, rapid wake from hibernation and rapid wake from being suspended works very well with this hardware; (2) intuitive and fluid user interface; (3) responsive touchscreen; (4) impressive complimentary applications (via Sony and/or Best Buy); (5) great sound; (6) great screen resolution, clarity and brightness; (7) amazing flip between laptop and tablet feature; (8) nicely implemented backlit keyboard; (9) highly customizable Sony utilities (e.g., advanced battery charge management); (10) impressive BIOS access features; (11) pleasant keyboard tactile response and layout; (12) satisfactory interfaces (2 USB, HDMI, SD card, Ethernet, combined audio in/out); and, (13) sleek aluminum and plastic case and overall efficient use of space.  There are a few cons worth noting as well:  (1) on a rare occasion the O.S. will seem to freeze for around 10 to 30 seconds and become entirely unresponsive, which I haven't really investigated and can only very loosely theorize to perhaps be related to either an I/O read/write delay with the hard drive (not an SSD) or maybe due to a background process overwhelming the processor/O.S.; (2) a suboptimal mouse touchpad which I've found works best by disabling the Windows 8.1 application switching features and also by not resting my hand/fingers on the laptop surface while using it; (3) a peculiar defect associated with the factory BIOS firmware in which any Ctrl + Shift + (Any Key) 3-key combination does not work as it should, which is very frustrating for a keyboard power-user (i.e., word processing, writing code), although based on the positive support and feedback that I've received thus far from Sony I am confident that their in-progress and forthcoming BIOS firmware update will resolve this as they have claimed; (4) if you're a high-end graphics user or hardcore gamer then this laptop might not be for you given the limitations of the Intel HD Graphics 4400 integrated video graphics chipset which shares system RAM, although still-frame artists might find the Active Pen Stylus (sold separately from Sony for $40) used with the touchscreen to be an intriguing replacement for their Wacom drawing tablet; (5) if you're intending to run virtual machines (which does have BIOS support) then you may be disappointed by the somewhat restrictive 4 GB of RAM, although this computer is still capable in this area just to a lesser degree; and, (6) the case design is not conducive to easy component upgrades or replacements and in fact opening it would presumably void the one-year warranty, although message boards and YouTube appear to demonstrate that it is possible to modify the innards (e.g., swap RAM and hard drive).  For my expectations and intentions I give the Sony VAIO Fit/Flip 14 a grade of 95% which works out to roughly 5 stars, though I can understand how some graphics and/or RAM power users might be disappointed and instead rate this as 4 stars.  If you're expecting more than what is provided in this product as marketed then you could be further disappointed:  this is not a desktop replacement unit.  Personally I am satisfied and feel that I have received good value for the dollars spent.
6 year old proof  Okay, well quite honestly had I have been purchasing a computer this would not have been my primary choice.  I had a Toshiba and was perfectly content with this.  But, a relative purchased this & realized that they were completely computer illiterate so ended up buying this for next to nothing.   This computer has been the most durable computer I've ever ever had.  I have a tendency to break laptops, which is why I swore my next computer would be a desktop.  My first two laptops suffered broken screens (another Dell & a Compaq) my Toshiba's keyboard fried after typing a quick msg after getting out the shower with slightly damp hands.   This Dell that I am currently typing this review on has been dropped, things spilled on, and taken so many blunt hits.  Let me explain, I have a 6 year old technology hating computer killer.  She has successfully dropped this laptop from a kitchen table.  This computer hit so hard it knocked the hard drive out.  She then decided that instead of moving the computer after the hard drive was pushed back in, she was going to knock it off the couch because she wanted to sit down.  Nothing major happened to the computer.  So, computer killer decides she's going to spill her morning orange juice on it when she's watching Monster High on Youtube.  Screen changes colors and tweaks out making a hissing sound.  I thought that my PC avenger had finally toasted the laptop.  Ten minutes later, computer is working like new.  The computer then became a Play-Doh molder.  The buttons really took that hard.  They are impossible to take off without taking apart the computer, so we waited and waited and as the playdoh became more crusty it shank and fell out.  Keyboard works great.  I know this is probably a pointless argument for purchasing a laptop -- but I know there has to be other computer crushers in other households, and if you have one, this is your laptop.
Fantastic service!  Arrived quicker than expected. Exactly what I needed and exactly as described in description. Fantastic service!
Good swift shipping and arrived in great condition  The cargo malamute of laptops - not the lightest or the swiftest, but a noble combination of power, and pure ruggeddness. Unbeatable value!  Good swift shipping and arrived in great condition.
Everything I hoped it would be  I needed a laptop for college and I also needed a little processing power to back up what I enjoy doing. This thing takes care of pretty well most of my needs. It handles the most menial tasks without twitching and plays anything from Team Fortress 2 to Modern Warfare 2.  Pros: Pretty good graphics processor 6gb of RAM good speakers Nice hotkey buttons along the top. Nice speed with the i5 decent battery life for being a gaming laptop  Cons: Not an i7 Battery life is around 4 hours get pretty hot during gaming Bloatware...pretty much everything extra that MSI puts on the computer that is useless junk. =[  I recommend this laptop for anyone who is multimedia oriented or enjoys gaming. Expecially for students like myself who need a computer but want a little horsepower.
it works and i love  THANK YOU!!! needed a laptop. it works and i love it
I love it.  Light, fast and easy to transport.  Fired up and was a great Xmas present theres not really anything I do not like as I am a simple user and for me it does what I need when I need it.
Absolutely Love It  I am a demanding laptop user who bought the Chromebook on a lark, more than half expecting that it would fall short of any hopes. It has turned out -- hands down -- to be the best laptop I've ever had, and I've literally had more than two dozen over the years. The keyboard is outstanding -- I like it better than any ThinkPad I've had -- and it is super quick and intuitive. I've now had it for two months and the more I use it, the more I love it. I write for a living, and I am embarrassed to admit that I have, um, five working computers, an IPad, a Blackberry 9900, an Android handheld, and an Android 7".  My favorite device by far? The Chromebook. It's a thing of beauty. I do not understand reviews to the contrary. This is the best deal in a computer I've ever gotten.
Everything I Need  Good quality and speed. Have been using for almost two months and so far so good. Computer is everything I need for home use and more. Would definitely recommend to others.
I love this computer very face and easy to use  I love this computer very face and easy to use. I bought it to use for school and it does the job and more. The seller shipped my computer very fast .The price was great for a computer with some many features. Love windows 10
This laptop is amazing,  Is fast and i mean fast. Yep i only had a couple of horus using it blah blah but it is what it is. I was a little inhibited for the whole "new windows 8" but one get is to it. So for the price you get a amazing computer.
Good
A Full Five Stars From Me  I've had a lot of high-end laptops over the years (Sager, Vaio, Alienware, ...) and this is easily the best. Beautifully conceived and executed. Feels and looks sold. The switch-blade trackpad is sensitve and responsive the way I like it. The speed and power is great. The keyboard has exceptional tactile response for any laptop, actually feels nicer than a Mac. Doesn't run insanely hot. I have found no negatives yet, this rates a full five stars!
I waited to review this unit until I was able to test it fully  The display is the ONE glaring reason I almost decided to return this laptop. This laptop uses TN screen technology and while it can come off at first as a cost-cutting shortcut, closer examination will reveal that there's more to it than that. A gorgeous IPS panel would have been nice but may not have been best for the Blade 14's intended purpose. Since this is a gaming PC the TN display provides a faster pixel response, better outdoor viewing, and screen burn in isn't an issue as it is with most IPS panels. TN displays also use less power than most IPS panels so your battery life gets a small boost. The only other issue I have is the mouse buttons. They are not the best and have a deep travel to them. The battery life is amazing for a gaming PC and not too shabby for a workhorse or MacBook alternative (which is exactly what this machine looks like). The power brick for this unit is surprisingly compact and no worse than any Ultrabook's power brick. This laptop is ideal for someone who needs a very powerful Win 8 laptop but will sacrifice top tier battery life and display for a highly efficient and portable gaming rig that moonlights as your every day goto PC.
Amazing Laptop A+ - Runs fast  Amazing Laptop A+ - Runs  fast, great screen resolution and very lightweight. Also got it for a great price.
mdsnow  I bought this laptop at frys in December 2014  because I wanted a laptop that I can play games on the laptop works great for almost all of the games in the steam library although a lot of the newer games like call of duty black ops 3 Mafia 3 Assassins Creed Syndicate I have to run on lower graphics because the graphics card is two years old it can run all of these games but you have to lower the settings on some of them this first year I had this laptop it had a lot of issues in one year I think I've brought this computer into fry's for repair a total of 3 times the third time I upgraded the hard drive to 2 terrabytes and installed windows 10 onto it and it's been working great since then so always make sure you get a warranty when you buy a laptop.
I liked it  I have had it for 2 months, and it is a great computer. It arrived on time and everything seem to be working well as at now.
Endless Possibilities  Wanted to be able to load Ubuntu 14 on this machine.  However, after test driving it for the past two days, it is not worth the effort to have dual operating systems.  Google chrome is a fine example of how a great, it not excellent and lower cost computer should be.  Has almost everything that you can imagine like MS_Office and not to be mention GMAIL which somehow is able to import all your bookmarks from both Firefox and Internet Explorer.  To me, this is the stuff I was most concerned about and thinking about when installing Ubuntu. No viruses and instant software updates and not to mention an incredibly quick boot  time.  External storage using a SD card, USB Thumb drive and even other external devices as scanners, backup drives etc. just simply works everytime.  Slight different but definitely a great little computer.  The possibilities are endless.
Great for those on the go or light users with  Got this for my fiance for work.  She needed a laptop for business use but all job requires is office suit email and web applications. This was perfect.  Super fast and light to carry very convenient for those who don't quite need full functionality of a laptop/pc or maybe those people that are lucky to be able to know how To use apps .. Lol
Toshiba rocks!  Toshiba rocks!, apple design, toshiba performance
Great laptop  Only had this laptop a couple of days but I love it!  I was hesitant as to what condition it would arrive in as it is a refurbished model.  So far so good! Looks like new.  The graphics are awesome, I play WoW and I'm able to play with ultra settings at 60fps.
Great computer! Very little damage just minor scratches on the outside. My shipment was upgraded to expedited shipping free.
Works great all around the house and shop.
Love it!  I love Chromebooks because they're portable, have long, long, long battery life, and are so inexpensive. This one is so much better because it has a touchscreen which makes scrolling even better.
Good price point for a student laptop.  This laptop has held up well for a few years.
Great little laptop!  Great little laptop. Build quality is good. I upgraded the memory to 8GB and Samsung SSD. It is quick and I can run Adobe CS and Microsoft Office on it.
No Wifi Issue  I don't usually write reviews, but I feel obligated to write this one since there were so many reviews reporting wifi issues. I was concerned, but I bought anyway since the computer had everything I was looking for. I was preparing to install new drivers like some users recommended, or even purchase an external wifi usb device if it came down to it.  Fortunately, I don't have to do either as the wifi issue doesn't seem to be a problem on the unit I received. I bought it refurbished, so maybe the wifi problem was something Lenovo fixed before reselling. I get full bars and my download/upload speed doesn't seem hindered at all, which were the main issues I've been hearing about this product.  I'm happy with my purchase. It's a nice laptop overall, though I'd save money by buying refurbished.
Very happy with my laptop and all other products i have ordered and received from Amazon. I always have a good idea around when my items are coming which is great to know.
Love this computer  Love this computer. It works really well and the monitor is amazing. Windows 10 works really well and it was seamless to set up and use. All my data transferred so easily. Cons: don't have any.
I love my computer  I love my computer! I have about 35 high resolution games on it and it has no problem with any of them. Over a year of use now and no complaints.
This is by far the best purchased I have made  This is by far the best purchased I have made. The condition was like brand new, good functionality and good price.
Perfect for my two kids to do their schoolwork and keeps them off of my laptop.  Great investment for the price.  Their schools use Google docs and this is all they need.
I have had my Irulu Walknbook for a week now and love it! What a wonderful product at the perfect price. I use it while I am on the move to keep track of my small business. Just a tip for future purchasers: buy an SD card to make up for the lack of memory space.
Very good  I love my Mac. Had some issues that were resolved. I am happy with it.
This has been a great little laptop.
Great PC  I love this PC, what a beast. my favorite one i have ever bought and i have bought a s*** load. tons of power beautiful screen, super fast..Fantastic
I Love it!!!!!!!! This is the best thing I have bought.
For my usage, faster than 2008 Macbook Core 2 Duo 2.4 Ghz  I, like everyone, was hesitant about dropping down to a 1.8Ghz processor however it is true if you are doing iLife/internet browsing etc type work then you will consider this a faster computer than the older 2.4ghz macbooks. I have not yet tried Parallels or iMovie, I would imagine they would also work fine though some rendering tasks in iMovie would obviously be a bit slower than on a 2.4ghz Macbook. This 13" is perfect.  However for heavier lifting I can't wait for April (hoping for a 15" DVD-less Macbook Pro with 512GB built in and fast i7). Imagine all the space the DVD takes up in the 15" Macbook Pro...with that space apple can add batteries (permitting a faster processor). When you also take out the physical case of a 2.5" SATA hard drive you can add even more batteries or simply reduce weight/thickness.
Very satisfied with my Amazon purchase!  The Laptop is great
Great Device  This device replaced my office desktop PC, macbook air, and iPad. I have simplified my technology while at the same time am getting more out of technology with this device. The integration with g-mail, google drive, google docs, google calendar is great. It's fast, boots instantly, display is good, battery life is amazing, light weight, nice size screen. It is intuitive and it just works. The quality is good, a little less than you would find on a macbook Air, but at a fraction of the price. I like this better than my 11" macbook air because of the bigger screen and I'm not nervous to throw it in a bag take it out and use it at this price.  As a follow up after using the device for a couple months, the white plastic is starting to discolor in places even though I wipe it clean with a cloth daily. It seems to be caused by heat. Chrome remains as fast as the first day I used it and battery life continues to amaze.
Outstanding Dell XPS system  Have been using this system for a couple of weeks now and love it.  Great compact design, very thin for a system with a optical drive, and the keyboard is excellent.  Pros - Elegant design, slim body, great keyboard + trackpad, Intel architecture, and Dell warranty.  Cons - Dell bloatware.  I would prefer to see Dell load very clean installs instead of some of the useless software they will load to collect bounties.
Awesome!  Love it! It's a little big, the keyboard has that extra digit keyboard on the right side that usually desktop computers have but it's all right, it's not gigantic or anything, it's just kinda big, which surprised me but you definetely get used to it. It was delivered in perfect state to me, not a single scratch.
Nearly best buy of year...but a TOP purchase winner!!!  What a workhorse. Run small business on it. Fires up in 20 seconds & we are at end of line--horrible ISP situation.  Love touchscreen, would never go without now.  Only thing I missed was no lighted keys.  That would have made it most perfect purchase of year. Love the 3.0 USB.  Great for downloading pics (with a high speed transfer insert!). Also, software not caught up yet, often have to still go thru Explorer, for now-very doable.  Bigger than it looks.  HAD a 17", this is nearly as large & waaay less cumbersome.  Clear graphics, clean set up. Like box store geek squad guy said--buy it!!! They sell same one/other brands also with SAME specs for $1,200 & up.  Can't touch this price, even at warehouse club. Did my homework.
Awesome Value  My grandson love this computer. It's easy to use and great for children ages 6 and above first computer. Great deal!
Works well in the blended classroom.
Excelent
This is the computer that is replacing a desktop and a laptop...and it does!  Fast. Holds charge a lonnnngggg time, whose touch pad is so sensitive that you must barely touch to move the cursor, makes it is so much faster..  Light and solid, and the only draw backs are getting used to opening it (very small opening for finger nail, not a finger) and an obnoxious instructional black block with an orange arrow that blocks the screen, and Samsung support can't  seem to lose it - after several swipes it finally goes away...for awhile.). Not having a dvd slot doesn't seem to be a problem, since so many suppliers are downloading rather than using discs. Reads all cards that I have; 2.0 and 3.0 slots, built in mike and camera, and the list continues.  Screen and backlit keyboard react imperceptibly to ambient light, yet can be over-ridden if necessary.  BTW, chat support is quick and professional, even for the most foolish questions.  2014 edition vs. 2015? - biggest difference is the price...and there aren't many left.
I like it  very nice  key board has a nice touch  screen is sharp  and NOT eye straining reflective like so many.  Fast and sleek. The touch screen is responsive and easy to use even with fat stubby fingers. Wifi hooks right up etc. All in all a very nice machine with a very nice price. I like it.
I love my new laptop  I love my new laptop.  A little heavy if I had to carry it around all day but the 17" is perfect for those tired old eyes!
Great computer, just what I was looking for!  Wanted a full keyboard but not the weight.  This is perfect.  My only tiny complaint is the mouse on the lap top is a little  stubborn.  Nothing that a wireless mouse can't fix!
Perfect for college students on a budget.  I bought this Chromebook for the fact that I needed something lightweight, yet be able to get the job done when I'm on campus. And that's just what it is.  I am very happy with it because while it does not have the resolution as a Macbook would, I am able to do all my work and still listen to music on Pandora without a hassle. While you can't really do much without Internet, you can save your work to the actual hard drive of the computer, and work on it on the go.  So in conclusion, if you want amazing resolution and a ton of software for editing and whatnot, then splurge on a Macbook. But if you just need something light, cheap, and gets your school work done, then this is the laptop for you.
Good value  We purchased this laptop for our daughter who is going to be going to college this fall.  For the price (579.99), it is a great value.  The 17 inch screen makes it a bit big, but she says she loves it.  For what she is going to be using it for, it is a great computer.
My daughter uses google docs though and she's been fine.  My daughter uses this for her online public school courses as well as her online college courses and she loves it. Just be aware that there is no caps lock, you can't right click and there's no dvd/CD player. You can download Microsoft office but you have to do it online. My daughter uses google docs though and she's been fine.
Reman. laptop that works - Good job Dell  Works great... I was very hesitant to by reman, as I've had a couple of bad experiences in the past. This works very well. I use for a home recording studio requiring a ton of memory/processor. The speed/cleanliness is exactly what I'm looking for.
Go for the beast..  I bought this from Prague during my visit as the model wasn't available in India. I have been using it for the past 1.5 years and I am fully satisfied.  * Battery Life - Around 6-7 hours average. But if you're not watching any videos or something, it can go upto 12 hours. * Durability -  Accidentally spilled beer during a football match. Guess what, nothing happened. The system was perfectly fine. *** Doesn't get too much heated ***  I haven't turned off my system in 2.5 months. And it still works perfectly fine without any slowness. I also play occassional counter strike and the Intel graphics card is more than enough for it.  Cons: ===== * It's a bit heavy. * Looks wise, it's not that great.
No More Desktop For Me  It's a little heavier than I expected but otherwise, I Love It.
Good item works for me . Came faster then expected . Very recommended .
Acer Aspire windows 7 laptop  Computer arrived on time. It was so easy to make it work. I was able to easily download the security program that I wanted, and my husband is using the computer with no trouble at all. I only need to change the font inside the computer and I have not been able to figure that out. Other than that we are happy with the computer and finding the computer online thru amazon was very easy and convenient.
Great computer  Arrived on time and works perfectly. It's really fast and better than what I was expecting. The price was also great.
Pretty Good  The computer is pretty good for the price. It has the speed I need and most of the hookups. The only issues I have with it are minor. There's a hum that comes from my external speakers/headphones and mic. Though, it's not horribly loud, and it's possible that might be because I only have average quality equipment. Also, HDMI was advertised on a retailer's website, but it has no HDMI port. Lastly, you don't get a Windows disk. You have to create your own restore disks from a separate partition on the hard drive that takes up space on the advertised 320 GB HDD (which wouldn't be horrible if it was exactly what you'd get on a Windows factory disk since you could just reformat later). The problem is that it forces you to keep all the crap they load on the computer (HP factory settings) and spend hours trying to uninstall it all instead of just reformating and reloading Vista. All-in-all, these are minor issues that are more annoying than anything else. For a brand-name computer, it's pretty damn good. To have one custom made with the same specs would normally cost two to four times as much.
Works great. Not a single problem after three years  Had this for about three years. No a single problem.
Biggest Bang for the Bucks affordablequalitytech  Year to year  improvement in PC performance have "slowed down to crawl" Some say it is because Intel has a big lead on AMD and ARM performance. (In other words, Intel probably figures  performance is good enough.). Others think we are hitting the limits of the chip. While others think Intel has moved development resources to their more profitable server business. Regardless a top end 4-5 year old professional system like the T430 can out perform similar priced new low end systems by a mile. True, new low end Systems have more energy efficent chips for longer battery life and weigh less and run cooler.. But if want a  faster computer. And a  quality built system that will stand the test of time the T430 is the bargin buy. Since you are buying used, it is very important that you careful select a seller with a high rating who will ship a quality product and be there if you need them. . So read the reviews for each seller carefully. This is my 6 used system purchase. The best seller I have found is affordablequalitytech. Who also happen to be the low price leader. I am not sure how they do. Providing me with over spec product (more than in the Amazon liste and provided by other sellers), in great condition. Delivered super fast and packaged extremely well to prevent any damage in shipment. Highly recommend  affordablequalitytech. Who deserves their 100% rating.
Great Computer  Wonderful computer.  Lightweight, compact, portable.  Great for the office, plane, or car.  Would recommend this product without hesitation.  Plus its a Toshiba.
Loving it so far. No problems at all
Great quality computer with excellent HD screen  I purchased this computer about a month ago and I love it. I bought it due to its high-end specifications and reasonable price. I am an engineering student that will use this computer to run demanding 3D modeling programs and as of now, it has performed well. The HD screen is stunning and the glare-reduction makes a big difference when watching. The only criticism I have is that the trackpad and area below the keyboard does accumulate fingerprints.
Acer Chromebook computer  Love this computer. Starts fast, and connects easily to the internet.  Very fast and easy to use.  The touch screen works very nice as well.  I had tried a Dell product with Windows 8 and it was slow and very hard to use.  I returned it and bought the Acer Chromebook.
Serviceable Work Machine, Perfect Home Media Center  I bought two of these, one of which I hooked up to my television to use as a home media center. The processor speed isn't great, and I notice it lag a bit when running Microsoft Office, but mostly because I'm accustomed to using a much more powerful desktop machine. It's entirely serviceable as a work machine and for the price (I picked it up when it was on sale for $200) you won't find anything better.  As a media center, though it's great. It has more than enough power to run Kodi (formerly XBMC) and display 1080p video without hiccups. At this price point the combination of wireless AC, small-but-fast SSD, HDMI out, and bluetooth (for remote control connectivity) makes it a perfect dedicated streaming solution.
great product  the computer is a little slow, but really considering what I paid, what I need it for and how I use it I'm very happy.
Best for price, features, and capability.  Great gift for my 6-year-old niece.  She took to it immediately.  Right size and right features.  Reliable!  She's a happy kid!
Super impressed!  I've been a long time owner of Dell laptops but I thought I would see what this Asus a try!  Let me say that I am very impressed.  This is a sizeable laptop with an equally impressive performance.  This is not the kinda of laptop I would want to tote around often because it has a large screen and is somewhat heavy compared to smaller, more portable laptops on the market.  I was impressed with the ease of setup.  With the prompting of a few set up screens, I was online and connected to the wireless within minutes.  I'm still learning Windows 8.1 and soon to be 10 because I've been using older versions of windows up until now.  This laptop runs smoothly and quickly and is just what I need for our family!  Overall, I'm really impressed with Asus!
Great Dell Mini 10  I am extremely pleased with the Dell Mini 10 laptop. When I bought it I read the reviews and wasn't sure what to expect. I already have a 15 inch Toshiba laptop so I bought the Dell Mini specifically for the size. I wanted something to carry that's not heavy, which the Mini is. I carry it in a backpack and it doesn't weigh any more than some of my books. I don't even notice a difference. Also what I like is the battery. Once fully charged it lasts for at least 4 hours so I don't even carry the power cord with me, which is nice. The TV Tuner feature is great. I can pick up stations that are 25 miles away and the picture is good quality. The price at Amazon was a lot cheaper that what I was going to pay with Dell too.
This computer has been the best thing I've owned  This computer has been the best thing I've owned. Even in 2018 I'm using it for gaming so your guys equipment kicks ass. Nothing wrong with it keep doing you thank you msi.
So far i'm very pleased and happy with it  I got this computer to replace my old dell from a decade ago. I picked this one out of a list of about 4 other contenders with this one at the height of my price range, ultimately I decided to go with this one based on reviews and it just offered afew more bells and whistles for afew hundred more. So far i'm very pleased and happy with it, I can use it for music production and virtually everything with little to no lag, drawing/working on illustrations at high resolution is no problem and it plays pretty much any game i've thrown at it on max settings with little to no lag, I can even stream in 720p and maintain 60 frames on most games with high settings. The only real issue I've had so far is when I put it to sleep the monitor doesn't turn back on and I have to shut the whole thing down and boot it back up to make the screen work again, other than this, it works flawlessly and I couldn't be happier with with.
Its muy bueno
FAST SHIPPING ...PC AS DESCRIBED
Very satisfied  Very satisfied-arrived quickly. Computer functions perfectly.
Dell Inspiron 15-Inch Laptop  I had purchased one of these Dell laptops directly from the company over a year ago.  Really liked it for the price. Decided we needed a second laptop and shopped around.  Saw that Amazon had the same computer for a lower price than I paid from Dell. I would have never bought a second one had I not liked the first one.  A nice laptop, as I said, for the price. If I needed a third laptop I would buy another like the two I have and I would buy it from Amazon. Just hard to beat a good product, no shipping charge, and several day delivery.
Nice little computer.  Was bought for a highschool student to learn typing. Amazon had the best price, and its worked well so far.
FANTASTIC LAPTOP AT A GREAT PRICE!!!!  I am extremely happy with this laptop.  It is fast and so easy to set up and get started with online browsing. I am so impressed with this laptop that I ordered another one as a gift for my Mother. I see now why it has gotten such great reviews!!!!
bought as xmas gift for grandaughter
Gateway MC7833u  This is a very impressive looking laptop.  It's fast, with lots of hard drive space and ram and more than adequate for the average user.  It has a built in wireless card and camera, you couldn't ask for more.  The lighted keyboard makes it easy to type at night and the screen resolution is awesome! I highly recommend anyone to buy this inexpensive but classy computer.
This is an AWESOME ultrabook  I had read all the reviews i could find on this ultrabook before i bought it. I knew there was a chance i would have screen bleed or touchpad issues. I figured i would take my chances. I usually use a different mouse anyway. and i wasn't to worried about the screen. I have to say that i must have been lucky with the one i got. No screen bleed. no issues. no flaws. this thing is awesome! its super fast. very responsive touchpad. great battery life. and the screen looks amazing! very bright and colorful. The backlit keyboard works very well. its very easy to see at night. I have noticed that i fill up the 2 usb ports pretty quick. and wouldnt mind a 3rd. but thats not really an issue. Also i cant say enough about the quality of the build. it feels super sturdy. solid. not heavy. the keyboard is easy and smooth. the next laptop i get that is windows 8 will probably have a touchscreen. but for this one, i opted for the faster core i7 and larger ssd 256gb instead of slower, less memory with a touch screen for the same money. For what its worth, the included cases (the large one and the one for dongles) are very cool. well made. and helpful. i keep it in its case, in my laptop bag for extra protection. if you decide on this ultrabook, i'm sure you will have done your research, and you'll be happy with your purchase, because you get what your paying for here.
I love this computer  I love this computer. Highly recommended! If you must buy a PC, then this is top of the line. Can take user abuse well. Professional grade PC laptop.
Great Product, highly recommended seller, many thanks
Amazing computer  So far this is one of the smoothest running laptops I have ever own.  No matter the task there seems to be little to no delay.  For the price it can't be beat.
AMAZEBALLS!!  I absolutely love it!! It's perfect for school!!
Excellent Computer Experience!  Love the Acer!  I've bought other brands but haven't had the excellent success as the Acer!  Also, LOVE that I could purchase it with Windows 7 instead of having to use Windows 8 or later.  Thanks Acer!!!!
Excellent laptop...  Yeah, you are paying a little more but you are paying more for quality parts.  This laptop not only works well as family machine but when I need the robustness of a desktop for video and photography, I know I can trust it with this laptop.  You will not only enjoy the keyboard and light weight of the laptop but as well as the excellent design of the Operating System.  I have used Mac products now since 2002.  They just last.  My mother is still using my PowerBook G4 I pick up in 2002.  The only thing that wore out was the hinges.  No problem fixing.  You will enjoy using this laptop.
Wonderful.
Great graphics for mid-level gamers  I bought this computer for my friend in Spain, and he loves it. He also says the graphics are excellent and plays graphically-intensive Second Life with it. It is easy to carry and maintain -- and is a very good basic laptop.
It fits our needs perfectly for a small laptop at a good price.  We previously bought the smaller one for our daughter in college.  This was for our middle daughter starting online classes at the local university while in high school.  We knew what we were getting and this daughter likes the little bit bigger size.  It fits our needs perfectly for a small laptop at a good price.
This laptop is a great!
Very Pleased, Sturdy, Easy to set up, Runs Windows 7  Great workhorse computer. No frills like touchscreen. Runs the familiar and capable Windows 7. Has a nice fast Intel 4th generation Intel Core i7-4500U processor, 8GB Memory, 1 TB hard drive, and integrated Intel HD graphics with a bright 15.6" HD display. I like the fact that it came loaded with the MS Office software so that once I purchased the suite that I wanted online at the Microsoft store it was setup and ready to use in no time.  I used LapLink PCMover (also from Amazon) to transfer files and applications from my older Dell XPS and added a WD My Passport 1 TB external hard drive (from Amazon). Now I am up and running and very happy with the new set up. Thanks Amazon for having everything I needed, making it easy to chose the right components and getting them to me promptly before the failing hard drive on my older Dell XPS gave up.
5/5  One week in, literally no issues. Some stats which I found difficult to find: 3D Mark Scores: (For reference) Desktop w/ GTX Titan and i7: 25,000 Asus ROG GL551JW-DS74 on charger: 12,500  Battery while streaming video with keyboard back-lighting turned off and headphones: ~4 hours Battery while playing The Binding of Isaac: ~1.5 hours Battery while playing Fallout: New Vegas on max settings, no mods: ~1 hour  Pros: -Nice tactile feel to the center touchpad click -IPS panel is noticeably vibrant -Bloatware kept to a minimum -Solid feel, reminds me of a Macbook with more plastic  Cons: -My Caps Lock got stuck once  tl;dr For a decent battery and excellent performance, buy this laptop.
Very good product, thank you !
I love it
A great buy. Works well.
Excellent value!
Worth the price compared to other gaming laptops  My son loved this for Christmas!  His only complaint is that there is no memory card and that means he would have to do a memory upgrade.  Somewhat complicated but, he is learning more about it all and loving the speed and the large screen. Certainly worth the cost.  He especially likes the lighting.
I love it!  Today I received my laptop, it works perfectly! The keyboard feels soft and durable, it's backlit so that helps when working without lights.  The sound is amazing, I plugged the external speaker and I just love it, the games and music sound great!  I still have to keep testing since i just got it and I have to upload my apps and games, but so far this is keeping me happy, the touchscreen works great too!
Touch screen very responsive and even the low res screen looks fairly good when set against higher res display  Have used heavily for a year, every manner of surfing and streaming video, regularly outputting video to external HDMI display, even light video-editing and gaming (Alien Isolation at medium settings most recently), this has been a rock-solid performer surprising me at every turn. Touch screen very responsive and even the low res screen looks fairly good when set against higher res display. Battery life is stellar, often exceeding 7 hours at 50% brightness. Mouse track pad needs adjusting in the settings (hate Synaptics 'inertia' feature) --once that's done, the trackpad is very stable and responsive. For the price I cannot be more pleased.
The best laptop ever!  I brought it on April and used it for almost 3 month now. Everything for this computer is great, I just love it! Asus has the best quality laptop, better then apple, lenovo, sony...This is a great buy, and I'll definitely recommend for everybody!!!
Amazing. Chromebook for life. I'm hooked.  At first I was a little skeptical with Chromebooks with all the rumors I had heard. Being in school, I require my computer to be good at a little bit of everything. Streaming was particularly important to me, I mean, netflix and chill, right? I had asked around for a long time about their opinions on the Chromebook line, and the Chrome OS, granted most were die-hard Mac and Windows users, but most bashed the line, so I took my search to the interweb. When I ordered my C201, I was a little nervous to what I had put $200 towards. I recieved my package on Dec 11, and immediately took my knife to the thick tape. The ASUS packaging had a nice, simplistic look to it, clean and modern. When I opened the product packaging, I was pleasantly surprised with how light and thin this machine was. My unit came with 93% charge, but I plugged it in and booted it up. The set up was amazingly easy, almost too easy. After a day of in-depth, and heavy usage, and a night of standby, my battery is still at 72%. The overall experience of this machine and its OS scream productivity, multitasking, and scholastic. You can tell this is built for work, and education. I absolutely love this machine, its amazing an is EXACTLY what I was looking for. Beware, if you're looking for a PC to game on, turn around, keep walking; This is NOT it. a 1.8Ghz processor, and 2GB of RAM is not made for gaming. But I can say its made for me.
Love my Chromebook  I highly recommend the Chromebook, it is easy to use and is fast.  The screen is clear and colorful.  Love it.
it is absolutely great. top of the line and exceeding my expectations  it is absolutely great.  top of the line and exceeding my expectations.
Perfect for Internet surfing  This has worked perfect for my husband who uses his computer strictly for Internet surfing, you tube watching, and email.  No complicated programs for the novice to contend with.
excellent chrome book very fast and long lasting battery
T440S - Corporate Durability and Exceptional Service  Lenovo's T440S is quite simply the best laptop on the market.  The build quality is excellent.  The trackpad is an engineering marvel.  Although Lenovo did not get it right with their first trackpad two years ago, the T440S trackpad is great.  It is completely adjustable with the Ultranav settings to provide just the right personalized experience to maximize productivity.  BTW, I started with the Thinkpad 770 ($6,000) and have owned the T21, T30, T41, T42, T42P, T61, T61P, T430S.  I really count on Lenovo's Service and Support.  From the moment I contact Lenovo Support in Atlanta, my machines have been promptly serviced within 1 - 2 days.  That is really what sets Lenovo apart.  I learned from my first corporate IT experience, the Thinkpad is the gold standard for large corporations.  BTW, the best features that I like includes: full docking base station, low glare IPS touch screen, built-in ethernet (no dongles), SIM ready for cellular data connectivity, 17 hour battery life with power bridge dual battery technology, interchangeable battery (lifesaver to stay up and running), carbon fiber build for lightness and durability (aluminum scratches and is not durable), best LED/LCD hinges, and most importantly, the best keyboard in the industry.
Switch over from 1st year Surface Pro  I am switching over from a first year Surface Pro to the Dell XPS. Only had this for a couple days so this review is early and will update as time goes on with ownership.  Pros: Clean sleek design, very lightweight compared to my old Surface. The touchpad is quite responsive, the left and right click are not the strongest and can be a bit finicky but I rarely use them to where it does not interfere with my usage. The touch screen is responsive and allows for easy zoom in/out through pinching or spreading. Something the Surface Pro had issues with in my opinion. The converting flip screen from laptop to tablet is quick and sturdy. I love this feature and the simplicity of it compared to the Surface with flipping the keyboard under the device and not disabling the key functions. Not an issue here. Having the screen cover the keys rather than flip under the back is great as it allows for the fans and vents to freely flow and circulate. The windows UI is a BUTTON rather than a touch sensor which is another issue with the Surface. If using to write on or draw, brushing over the windows hotkey does not bring you to home screen as it requires the button press. So that is a benefit if you are looking to get this model or any of the models of XPS 2-in-1 convertible.  Cons: As mentioned, the left and right click are finicky and don't always function properly. As of now that is my only concern with such short usage to date.  Neutral: Battery life. Given this is not the Haswell i-5/ i-7 Intel processor which helps greatly extend battery life to roughly 8hours. This particular model has about a 5:30hours of battery life depending on processes. I primarily use this for graduate school and web surfing, e-mail, some videos on YouTube etc. So this is not being heavily used for media or photo/video processing. So given my usage of this laptop/tablet the battery life is decent enough for my purposes, very comparable to the Surface Pro which has a very similar life span of battery life. Major difference is that the XPS does not overheat to the extent the Surface Pro does with just basic use.  Summary: If you are looking for a 2-in-1 I would recommend this product as of now. It functions quite well for the purposes it was made for. If you are wanting a stronger battery life and processor for such usages as video and photo editing and processing I would say spend the extra $200-350 and upgrade to the i-7 Haswell. But for basic use, school, work functions. This is a great deal for the money. Will update at milestone date of ownership.
Best for the price, anti glare screen, quiet, nice touch to the keyboard; time will tell as I just purchased it.  Sansung continues to be a company that gives you more for your money.  I am very pleased with my trial at the store and will keep you updated after we take her on vacation, but the keyboard is quiet, the screen is very easy on the eyes, connectivity should be just fine.  I can sing to the cd's, watch dvd's, upload my photos and keep in contact with my family and friends and write a journal and make movies of my photos....that is all I want and it will do that and so much more....later.
Great little laptop.  It's great for my wife. Emails and looking up things on line from the couch. Light and comfortable on her lap. Works very well and fast.
Loved it
Great product. Very reliable and efficient
The best laptop I have ever owned. And the price was fantastic.
Good laptop good price
Excellent  Can't get any better than an Apple.
Awesome 
I was a little hesitant at first to order it online but It arrived in perfect condition! It's so lightweight and exactly what I needed for nursing school!!
Great travel companion.  Great little computer. Starts up in a flash and is powerful enough for me to use entering sweepstakes online. Windows 8.1 takes a little getting used to but it's my quick goto machine when I need information in a hurry. The red/pink finish is not that durable so it scratches easily. The black version that we also have has the more durable exterior.
Good product.  No problems but did find that the space bar doesn't respond well.  I had read that in the reviews and so knew ahead of time it might be an issue.  The computer in general though is great.
2014 Report on some things that have changed -- NOT a general review  FIRST of all, if you are looking for an affordable netbook, this is a great machine. And this review really isn't for you.  What you'll find is a fast little machine that runs Chrome, from which you can watch videos and check your email.  No problem there.  The video quality is mediocre, but really, it's what one would expect from a super affordable machine.  NOW... There are some things that have changed since some of the first questions were answered.  Citrix - No Longer runs on this machine.  Citrix has withdrawn their product.  The way it works now you can only use Citrix if you can convince your company to run Citrix software on their server to support you. [I don't know about you but our system guys aren't going to update the system to support one or two people.]  Java - Doesn't support java.  It looks to us that Google is going to HTML5, which is a non-issue for most people.  We're exploring switching over to Ubuntu to allow us some Java, but that's not something everyone's going to want to do.  SUMMARY Processor performance is awesome. Streaming is great. The display screen is acceptable.  And overall, I think this little machine rocks.  However, it's not ready for some business applications since Citrix no longer runs on it.  Highly recommend.
I love this little chromebook  I love this little chromebook! I mostly watch things online, do banking and bill paying, and surfing the internet.  I love the touch screen and the portability of it. This is the second one I purchased because my grandson threw up  on the keyboard of my first on and it fried out, so in that regard it's pretty sensitive. But it is perfect for what I use it for, and I would definitely buy it again. I have had this one for almost a year and it's still just like it was when I bought it.
Best Laptop I have ever owned  I bought this laptop as a cheap(ish) replacement to my dying laptop and I am SO glad I did.  This baby has tons of power, able to run multiple games, multiple copies of chrome with extensions and multiple tabs, and virus scans without slowing down at all.  And best of all, it is cold! I have never experienced such impressive cooling as with this laptop.  I could go on and on about how light it is, how great the sound is, or how much I love the number pad they squeezed into the keyboard.  Very impressed my this model by Asus
Better than advertised and upgradable.
I love HP, and Amazon!  Great customer service, and a great product!
Nice Performance, Small Package  I have owned over 15 laptops over the years and I'll have to admit that I really enjoy this laptop.  It's small, quick, lightweight, has an on-board DVD-RW which is nice on a 13".  Runs quiet and cool which is nice during air travel.  The battery was listed as an area of concern when looking at this unit, I've never had an issue with it and it consistantly pumps out 3 hours of worktime for me.  It also doesn't seem to be degrading as quickly on the ability to hold a full recharge as other laptops have over the years.  The 64-bit system was an issue for older software without upgrade fixes on the market yet, but now most everything plays nicely with the software.  Overall, I would highly recomend this unit to others who travel and are looking for it all in a small package.
just bought 2 of these and they both work great. good deal.
Beautiful screen for surfing or watching TV  Beautiful screen for surfing or watching TV. I don't game or run a lot of programs so this is perfect for me. The mouse pad is a little tricky for my big handed boyfriend but was easily fixed by plugging in another mouse.
Definitely a must buy for any student!  This is the best bang for your back. I kid you not.  What I love: Portability Size Weight!!  So light. Color Accessibility to everything because it is NOT a chromebook AMAZING battery life USB access  What I don't love Lack of memory or ability to expand Does lag if you have too many things going on The color and resolution is a little off buy nothing bad  I love this thing so much. It was the best decision I could have made as a student and full time worker. It allowed me to not have to lug around my expensive and heavy laptop. This is affordable (yay), and works so well.
PC to MAC...no looking back  I'm still trying to figure out all the features, but am really happy to have switched from a PC to a Mac environment. I run Windows on here too and it works wonderfully. The user interface is so much cleaner and as I get accustomed to the various features, it's becoming clear to me how easy it is to use.
Aweskme  I love this!! It's fast, easy to use and affordable.  I only wish I could have desktop icons (or knew how to do it?). I'm a writer so I needed something to put my work on and know it's safe from everything. The apps are pretty awesome as well!  Great item! And shipped/delivered quickly!
Love it  Normally I don't like buying refurbished electronics, but I have always wanted a Mac. Surprisingly quick delivery, everything was packaged well. The power adapter works, but it has some damage to the cord, so I might end up getting a new one at some point.
it did and it was delivered on time and I was very satisfied with the product  Yes, it did and it was delivered on time and I was very satisfied with the product.
excellent lap top I love it .. with my old eyes it's easy to see // great graphics
you will come away pretty happy I think  The laptop is fast enough for daily work (office, web browsing, basic stuff) but won't do anything too demanding (the Pentium N3700 is an entry level processor), but the trade off for less power is all day battery life (typically 12 hours or so) without spending close to 1000 dollars on a premium ultrabook. If you look at this device as a budget ultrabook, you will come away pretty happy I think. Not really good for gaming or watching movies (the TN panel doesn't offer the best colors and viewing angles for entertainment), but it is good enough for working on writing stuff, spreadsheets, and other school/office tasks. There is no touch screen, but the lack of a touch screen means that the overall unit is lighter and gets battery life because of it. The trackpad isn't perfect, but it works OK. Other windows computers with a "precision trackpad" perform better, but are often only available on more expensive machines. The keyboard is comfortable enough, but its no ThinkPad. I write excessively and haven't had any problems with it.  Another user commented that other budget machines (around 200 dollars or so) are cheaper but much slower and less pleasant to use. I concur, after trying a few budget machines myself, it seems that a Pentium or other quad core processor is the minimum requirement for windows to be pleasant enough for day to day use. The celeron and atom processors (except perhaps the X7 in the surface 3) are generally not fast enough for a smooth experience in real world usage. This device is a perfect entry level PC, and while it costs twice as much as those other cheaper units, it will last a long time on a charge without compromising performance too much. A cheap 15 inch laptop with an i3 will be much more powerful, but get substantially worse battery life and weigh a lot more.  Overall, I recommend this device highly for anyone who is on a budget and wants a taste of the ultrabook life offered by the Dell XPS or Macbook Air. Sure, you won't mistake this device for one of those in appearance, feel, or speed, but its a similar product for half the price.  For the user who was getting the BSOD when booting (CRITICAL ERROR PROCESS DIED), just turn off the "fast boot" option in power settings and you should be golden. This option is provided so computers with spinning hard drives will boot quicker, but with the eMMC storage on this unit it boots fairly quickly without the "fast boot" setting. I turned it off after getting the BSOD twice and haven't had it since. To to this, go to control panel>power options and select "choose what the power buttons do" on the left panel of shortcuts. This will take you to a new screen, where you will have to click "change settings that are currently unavailable" to un-grey the options. Then un-check the box for "turn on fast startup." After this, you can restart the computer. The computer will boot a little slower, but no more pesky BSODs on start up!
Good Laptop  This is my second ACER laptop and both have and are giving me good service. I like the markings on the KEYS so you know what is going to happen when you press the key. For example, if you want to put the computer to sleep, press Fn and F4 (There is a sleep icon on the F4 key)  Performance has been reliable,  I haven't had any significant problems, and I hope they will continue to use Windows 7.
Very prompt and professional service  I bought this as a deployment gift for myself.  I must say that I am very pleased with the prompt service from this company and I would look forward to the opportunity of dealing with this company again in the future.  The condition of the Macbook that I purchased from them was grade A, with only a few unnoticeable blemishes.  When you factor in the software that they through in, the excellent battery supply, and the price, I'd have to say that this is the best deal that I could have ever hoped for.  Thanks for giving me something to look forward to after a long deployment to Afghanistan.  I'd highly recommend this company and look forward to working with them in the future.
It's a great PC  This PC met all of my requirements . This is so thin. The touch screen is responsive. Most importantly, it has all the bells and whistles at a great price, comes in a surprisingly sleek packaging and storage pouch is provided. The Dolby Home Theater sound makes it a winner as well. It's a great PC at a great price.
Pretty good so far!  Bought this laptop for my dad and set it up today. For now, it has performed quite exceptionally! I set it up at around 2pm and once it was fully charged, unplugged the charger. It has now been about 5 hours (without the cord plugged in) and it still has about 35% remaining. Compared to dad's old laptop, this is good! He specifically asked for a long battery life feature and I definitely found him one. Everything has been working fine but have not used the computer long enough for me to find out if something is wrong.
five starts
Awesome Laptop  I love this computer. Its fast and plus a touchscreen. I have never had a problem with this device
One of the best laptops I've ever purchased, and never so cheaply.
Good
Perfect...thx
Acer E5-573G  For the money it's an amazing computer - Mousepad isn't perfect, but it's better than another computers - The screen can be better, but it's a sub $500 laptop with 1080p .... wow - Hard drive can be a little slow, but with 2 hours you can replace it with SSD and do a clean install of Windows 10 - Memory.... i got mine with a single 8Gb stick, you can add a 4Gb stick for about nothing (now mine is running with 12Gb) - nVidia 940m is fast enought to play World of Warcraft in High (raids Mid) - 5th Core i5 is just fine
Great for parents and people who just browse the web  I'm a computer hardware engineer and this is my new favorite computer.  I use it everyday and have forsaken my windows desktop for occasional gaming. My work is all done through servers that I use chrome to remote-in.  I forced my parents to get these and they love them.  This can do everything your web browser can do from PDFs to CandyCrush.  It boots up almost instantly and contains the same wifi radio that your other laptop does.  I would give it 5 stars but I abused the HDMI connection and it quickly broke contact to the motherboard and I haven't had the time to solder it back on.  If I could give it 4.9 stars I would.  It may be important to note that the screen on this is NOT HD.  It does not advertise an HD screen so it doesn't deserve to have points knocked off, but it somewhat disappointed me.  I believe GoogleChrome will be the dominate OS for personal computing in the future.
excellent thanks
Nice unit thus far. No issues yet, so 5 stars it is.
Still using it to write this feedback. Haven't had any problems with it.
The Original List Price = Not Correct  The original list price is not correct.  If you go to www.apple.com and build your own with the exact, same specs as this website, the max price you'll ever see (before taxes) is $3548.00.  There is no way a MacBook Pro quadcore maxed out in all the specs in current model will ever break $4k before adding other accessories.  The $3548.00 includes 3 years of Applecare on Apple's website.  Amazon's website is misleading in this specific listing.
A Fine laptop  I bought this laptop and delivered to Korea where I stay. This laptop has a very fast booting and supports a comfortable user interface. It has no problem to foreigners for using. The Game Hearthstone is also supported.
good
Big 17.3", powerful and super fast  Ordered Dell laptop Sunday, arrived Wednesday via UPS. Outer and inner boxes undamaged. Laptop lit up and ran perfectly while I installed software on Windows 7 Pro already setup at factory (a prime reason for purchase choice). After three days, it's still super fast and responsive. I need the big screens for my word-processing business. Love the new backlit keyboard--no more USB plug-in light.  Even though the lithium ion battery has longer life, I was hoping for and happy to discover an extra battery is also available on this model to allow me to continue work offline when power goes out for extended periods. A serendipity perk.  My older Dell laptop with Windows 7 is 6 years old and still a strong work horse, so it will become backup. So far so good. I'll update this review in a few months.
Great used Mac find  My 1st MAC so I did not want to pay over $1,000. Its older, but works wonderful. Just a couple scratches on the outside. Came with all the software and upgrades stated. I love it. I see why this seller has 4 & 5 stars. I would definitely order from them again.
Great! Thank you so much
love my new ultrabook  Its an absolute good value for money.  Only 2 issues:  It doesnt have an inbuilt bluetooth.. the battery life is not too great.  Overall love this ultrabook.
Great used laptop  arrived quickly, was in great shape, all promised software was installed, great price.  The "plus" is that it was running windows 7!
Great affordable laptop  Very happy with purchase. SSD hard drive is definitely the way to go. So quiet.
my daughter uses this computer everyday for 5 grade STEM classes. She loves it.
1st MAC experience  This is the first time I have owned a MAC.  Actually it is my wife's, I'm stuck with a windows laptop.  I come up with every excuse to use the new MAC though.  MACs are the best, no doubt about it.  I will be getting a MAC desktop with my tax kickback this year...and I can't wait.
Online day trader  Originally looking at gamers laptops but cost prohibitive. The Lenovo Y50 was my next choice but with the Thinkpad P50 I could get a little more of what I needed and less of what I didn't at a better price. Really faaast!!
Decent laptop. I'm not crazy about windows 8 but the laptop itself has worked well. Had it for five months now.
Great Machine  I absolutely love this laptop! It's extremely lightweight and the battery lasts a long time. I am using it now and intend to for a while to come!
great value  terrific little laptop - ultra portable, boots up quickly - seems very durable. i love the matte finish of the screen, reflections are minimized.
All you ever want  It's a really nice computer and I like everything about it. I am able to plat all of the games I want because of it. It's really nice for gaming as well. Packing was great I picked it up the same day it got to my house.
Its a complete package!  I've been eyeing the MacBook Pros since they were first announced back in Jan. 2006. However, as with every brand new product introduced it had a lot of problems. I waited and waited till this last update in June 2007. It seemed like Apple sorted out the issues and Tiger is now mature so i took the plunge.  I bought mine directly from Apple since i qualify for the education discount. I must say that it has the absolute best screen i have ever seen on a computer. It is so bright that i can't view it at more than 75% brightness. The glossy screen shows vivid colors and is a pleasure to view.  Mac OS X itself is an amazing OS. Very easy to install and uninstall applications, you don't have to worry about Virus protection but i did enable the firewall. I had 0 problems syncing my phone with it using bluetooth. I had no problems connecting to my printer via our wireless home network. I even added some tweaks to get quicktime to play more types of movie files. It is lacking office applications but Apple's own iWork will do or even freeware NeoOffice was recommended to me, i have yet to try either.  Overall a very professional, fast, attractive, and feature-packed notebook.
ASUS 1025C-MU17-BK 10.1-Inch Netbook (Black)  Very happy with the very tiny laptop.  I needed to run Java for work so a famous product we won't name wouldn't work for me. Customer service very good when I had trouble with it; we had to reformat it and that was very easy and they stayed with me until completed.  It fits in most hand bags. Nice keyboard-comfortable to type on.
Laptop Review  Laptop was intended as a gift and is definitely great value for money. Fantastic visual display. Overall pleased with the price and shipping.
Great laptop. I bought it as gift for my husband, and now wish it were mine. Great quality, no issues. He sooooo appreciates its reliability when he goes online. Great price as well.
Great laptop but beware the fake retail price displayed  Great laptop but beware the fake retail price displayed.  The retail price for the 4GB/128GB/non-touchscreen model is $899 not $1199 which makes the listed price no bargain at all.  Other than that, fantastic laptop as long as you don't have oversized hands/fingers.  Far more functional than a tablet for not much more and not much heavier.
Takes a litte work, but GREAT for Lubuntu!  I originally purchased this for a customer who specifically requested it. Once I had it loaded with the software she wanted and everything, she changed her mind. I decided to play with it to learn Windows 8. I LOVE the small size! While the screen is small, its sharp and clear. Even my old eyes can read it. The battery life is great, it runs completely cool to the touch. There are so many good things to say about it, except for one... It's SLOW. Out of the box Windows 8 runs fine, sluggish, but fine. Once you begin loading it with Chrome and/or Firefox, anti-virus, anti-malware, etc., it becomes painfully slow. Then I had a happy accident. I was attempting to dual-boot Linux to play with that and accidentally installed it over the Windows partition. Oops! I had to get some work done, so I was forced to use Linux. Now I can say this thing is a ROCKET! Install Lubuntu or Zorin Lite and you'll never go back to Windows.
It rocks!  This netbook rocks!  I absolutely love mine.  Got the aquamarine.  It is loaded with 4GB of RAM, 500GB HD, and Windows Home Premium 64-bit.  Spent a little time removing some pre-installed stuff that I didn't want (way less than the normal crapware that comes pre-installed on most new computers) and getting Windows up to date and it runs like a champ.  The screen is the sweet spot; not too small, not too large.  It is a nice size for traveling and should be great taking it on the road.  Can't beat the specs on this one for the price.  Sorry HP and Toshiba (too brands I've bought in the past), this one kicks your butt.
Fantastic laptop; as hoped for; none of problems from other reviews  I bought this for approx $1200 and it was the best I could get for that money for what I wanted.  I did the research, incl reading tons of reviews.  Heaps of old reviews complained about the wifi.  That is really important to me coz I travel a lot and is exactly what I wanted it for, plus at home we all have a laptop each and all use the wifi.  But then I read that this particular model - the B01 - had got a new wifi card in it, plus if there was still a problem, Samsung would put an even better one in it for you (they have upgraded the card again in the latest model, I gather).  I have now had it for a month, and am overseas with it already.  It is perfect so far -- handled wifi in public places, up and down stairs in houses, etc. It is super light & super-fast and does everything I want it to, for work and play.  The only drawback would be the small HD - I got 128GB coz that is what was available for $1200.  I would have had to pay $500 more for the 256GB, but also, when I wanted to get it, the 256 was out of stock where I was looking and I wanted it quickly, so I took the 128.  It is going to run out of space fast if i keep everything on it like itunes and all my photos.  So I just have to get used to using the external HD I got. (and maybe the i-cloud, too.  So i am sure it will all work.  BUt these are nothing compared with the benefits of the speed and lightness. Oh, and the beautiful feel of the keys -- much better than my last laptop - plus the backlit keyboard is exc.  Everything feels good. Even the mouse pad.  I have honestly not had any problems at all and would wholly recommend it.  Esp for speed freaks (ie, multi-tasking, don't like to wait for anything...) - there is no waiting to turn on or off, sleep or wake.  No down time when you don't need it. I love it. I would get it again in an instant.  This is a bit 'off the cuff' for a review, but I hope it helps.  CHeers.
An awesome purchase. Better than the Acer and Samsung chromebooks.
Excellent Product  This is an excellent product, I recommend for students like me, certain cover all my necessities in the university and my home entertainment. don't think about it twice... order now...
More than enough computer.  This has been a fantastic used laptop for school and research projects. The Apple OS works seamlessly with the solid state hard drive.
asus lab top  I love the lab top I think I will order one more for my daughter for school, have not had any thing go wrong with this.
Good laptop for the price, no issues!  I have had this computer now for a few months and have had no problems with it. It is quick on start up and the screen is really good. The only things I regret (although you can use an external DVD drive, or download movies etc on a thumb drive) is it does not have a built in DVD player and from the looks of it, it would be hard to change out drives, or add memory (haven't tried yet). I knew this going in and so far it is not a deal breaker, but I would still like to have had one hindsight being what it is. This laptop is light and the materials used feel solid to the touch and not cheaply made.
Perfect order  Refurbished and runs perfectly
Nice one  Excelent , But Windows 8 Ain't the best OS ever just needs to be changed to Windows 7 And It's done a very OP laptop :)
Serves purpose well
Beautiful, Mobile, and Fast  INTRODUCTION I had considered buying the previous generation MacBook Air (pre July 2011) but just couldn't quite force myself to spend the money on machine that still used Intel's Core 2 Duo CPUs (despite the fact that the older Airs were still actually quite speedy).  Apple was using the then newer generation Core i5/i7 CPUs on their other computers.  So when Apple updated their Airs with Intel's significantly faster Sandy Bridge i5/i7 CPUs, I became interested again.  But, which size would be best for me?  11" VERSUS 13" I've been struggling over this decision on which size 2011 MBA would be better. It's the usual dilemma with the 13" boasting pretty much better specs and battery life than the 11". Then I thought, well, the 13" is ONLY 2" larger diagonally, and ONLY weighs a "little" more (and ONLY costs a "little" more).  But the reality (for me) is that for a truly mobile device, like an iPad, only the MBA 11" has a shot at being mobile. The MBA 13" is great and certainly more mobile than a conventional MacBook Pro 13", but the MBA 13" is still IMHO more of a portable, than a mobile laptop.  The MBA 11" is actually mobile.  Once I realized this, there really was no longer a comparison to be made. They are two different devices. One being mobile and the other very portable.  I have a 2011 MBP 17" which is my ultimate portable, and now my 2011 MBA 11" is my mobile computer.  PROS 1. Extremely fast CPU - The MBA 11" comes with a Sandy Bridge 1.6 gHz dual-core Core i5 CPU (or a 1.8 gHz dual-core i7 directly from Apple).  Despite rumors to the contrary, the Turbo Boost and hyper threading capabilities were NOT turned off in the Core i5 CPUs.  Geekbench benchmarks show extraordinary speed increases.  The previous generation MBA 11" 1.4 gHz Core 2 Duo produced 2024 on Geekbench, while the 2011 MBA 11" now produced 5040 for a 149% increase.  This speed even rivals the 2010 MacBook Pro 17" which scored 5423!  The 2011 MacBook Air 13" uses a slightly faster 1.7 gHz dual core i5 which scored 5860.)  2. Extraordinarily small!  The MBA 11" measures 11.8 x 7.56 x 0.68 inches, while the MBA 13" is 12.8 x 8.94 x 0.68 inches.  This means that the 11" is "only" 1 inch shorter and "only" 1.3 inches less deep, but in reality, when you hold up both machines, the MBA 11" feels like a completely different machine.  My wife uses a 2011 MacBook Pro 13" which has a similar footprint to the MBA 13".  The MacBook Air 13" still felt too much like a laptop, albeit an extraordinarily thin and light one.  3. Extraordinarily light!  The MBA 11" weighs 2.38 pounds (while the MBA 13" weighs 2.96 pounds and an iPad 2 weighs 1.35 pounds  I actually  sometimes hold the MBA like an iPad while reading in bed because it's so light.  If you are seeking just a light, portable laptop, then the weight of the MBA 11" or 13" would be great, but if you (like me) are seeking a truly mobile device, then even fractions of a pound matter.  The MBA 11" weighs less and is consequently the better choice, but as amazingly light as it is, even lighter would be better.  Its doubtful that a mobile device will ever exist that would be considered too light.  4. High-speed Thunderbolt (i.e. Lightpeak) port offering bidirectional 10 gigabits/s throughput - Thunderbolt technology is far more revolutionary than USB 3.0 or eSATA.  Thunderbolt is NOT limited to the use of a storage device.  An external LCD can be attached.  Although I use the MBA 11" as my mobile device, it may be acceptable as a primary computer if one attaches an external LCD display and a high-speed Thunderbolt drive.  Supposedly an external Thunderbolt hard drive would be nearly as fast as an internal hard drive.  5. Everything is solid state!  This MBA feels more like a true "mobile" device since it is fully solid state with its solid state drive.  I am far less worried about damaging this versus other laptops I've owned in the past.  6. Extremely fast cold starts and shutdowns thanks to the solid state drive and OS X. 7. Great, full-size keyboard AND keyboard backlighting is back again!  While this may seem like a minor point, the previous generation Core 2 Duo Airs did not have the backlighting.  8. The battery life between the 11" and the 13" was only found to be 36 minutes shorter for the 11" (and NOT the 2 hours claimed by Apple) for light usage by Anandtech [...].  The battery life is Apple (conservatively) rated at 5 hours (compared to 7 hours for the MBA 13" and also 7 hours for my MBP 17").  Apple's battery life ratings have become much more stringent in the past few years are much closer to real world usage.  I am indeed able to use my 11" for about 6 hours with light usage, which is much better than Apple's claimed 5 hours.  9. Tremendous, typical Apple build quality.  The MBA feels like a piece of solid precision crafted machinery. 10. Same great glass trackpad with even more gestures in OS X Lion to be used. 11. Comes with the new Mac OS X Lion (which I won't discuss, but it will allow for apps to use a full-screen mode which is of benefit to MBA 11" owners) 12. Extraordinary aesthetics - I can't express adequately in words how beautiful this machine looks.  CONS 1. Although I have a Samsung LCD, the vertical and horizontal viewing angles are not nearly as good as on my 2011 MBP 17".  It's still more than acceptable, but it's something that MacBook Pro owners will probably notice. 2. Some MBAs come with a Toshiba solid-state drive which is not necessarily a con, but this may bother some users.  In real world usage, I have read that one cannot detect any speed differences, but if you like to run benchmarks, then the Toshiba drives in the 128 GB size seem to be slower than the Samsung 128 GB drives in certain benchmarks. 3. MBAs come with either a Samsung or LG LCD panel.  It's not clear what the differences are between them.  There is pure speculation and mostly fear that one panel is superior to the other, but I have seen comparison photos of both types of displays, and the only difference I can notice is an extremely slightly warmer look to the LG panel.  BUT this was on computers that did not have the screens color calibrated.  In any case, I can state clearly that my 2011 MacBook Pro 17" display is vastly superior in color and viewing angles, but they are completely different machines. 4. There is no SecureDigital memory card slot on the 11" MBA, although there is one in the larger 13" size.  I can't believe I got another Mac laptop WITHOUT a SD slot!  My 17" MBP doesn't have one either while the smaller MBPs do!  And now, the smaller MBA doesn't have one while the larger one does!  I wonder if I'll ever get a Mac with an SD card slot!)  TIPS 1. Believe it or not (do a Google search) but if you use Adobe's Flash, your laptop battery life will most likely be significantly shorter.  Some reports show that having Adobe flash turned off allows for 2 hours of additional battery life. 2. I purchased the MBA 11" with standard 1.6 gHz Core i5 and am happy with this.  If you get the built to order ones from Apple, you can upgrade your 11" to include the same 1.8 gHz Core i7 that's also available as an upgrade on the MBA 13".  Anandtech has found that the 1.8 gHz Core i7 upgrade produces significantly faster benchmarks >20% speed difference without a shorter battery life.  The i7 upgrade did produce significantly more heat, however. 3. If you do not need a truly mobile laptop, then the MBA 13" is probably better for most people's needs as a standard conventional laptop (albeit very light, thin, and also beautiful). 4. If you absolutely must have USB 3.0, and you can wait, then you should know that Intel's next future CPU/chipset for Ivy Bridge will allow for native USB 3.0 support.  CONCLUSION There is no such thing as the perfect computer for everybody just as there is no single tool for every task for every person.  I needed a truly mobile laptop to fit with my lifestyle and work needs, which for me included a smartphone, tablet, mobile laptop, and a large laptop/desktop replacement.  For the right person, this MBA 11" is truly in a class of its own.
Amazing Purchase!  I just received this in the mail a few days ago as replacement for my old Sony Viao. I love them both but it was the price point and quality reviews that caught my attention. After researching a number of sites looking for product details and further information, I finally made the purchase and I couldn't be happier!
Wonderful
Amazing Computer,Great value for very Premium Laptop  The Asus NX90 is an amazing computer. It's very large and at 9.7 pounds isn't very portable,however as a desktop replacement it really works. The screen clarity is great,and the sound out of the Bang & Olufsen speakers is unreal. Runs very quiet and has a very nice feeling keyboard. The touchpads work really well ones you get used to it. Overall this computer is a great value,with top of the line specs, metal casing and very premium feel. The mirror finish looks really cool.
Love it!  Love it!
Great Chromebook With Access To The Google Playstore!  Bought this on a whim back in March 2017 for $188 shipped. I can say this is by far the best $188 I've spend on a computer. It is ultraportable and well-built. The only thing I find lacking is the screen quality but I can't complain considering the price. I already fell I got my money's worth out of this computer. I also got access to the google play store with last nights update (08/18/2017) so for those of you that are looking for a chromebook with play store access in the stable branch this one now has it!
My husband love it works really good and his other one was broken so this was his replacement
This is the first time using the brand but I really like it. The only thing I miss is not having a cd-rom but other than that it is great. I love the navy color, the sleekness and light weight.
good
I love it  LOVE IT, EVERYTHING ABOUT IT
... have been using it for 5 months and works great. Good value for the money  I have been using it for 5 months and works great. Good value for the money. No problems so far. Low Battery time could be an issue for people without a socket for a long time but that is not my case.
I love this thing  I use this as a computer for my living room. As long as you are not expecting much from this computer, it does a great job at browsing the web, displaying web videos (even in HD) and playing flash games. It is even decent at google hangouts. Highly recommended as a secondary computer.
14 Points that made the deal  I compared Asus and Dell before I decided on netbook. I was a bit weary because IBM sold this line to a Chinese company and I was worried that the quality would be diminished.  The comparable Asus that I tested felt cheap, the Dell that a freind has was nice quality, but did not have all the perks that the Lenovo has.  The 14 points that sold me on this purchase:  1)The 10.2 inch screen is crystal clear and makes for better viewing pleasure. It is a matte screen which I like better than the glossy screen when using in direct sunlight.  2) The power setting programs, which extends battery power, is well thought out and screen is quite bright even at the low power setting.  3) The expansion port that will allow me to add an air card to the computer. (I notice now that Asus and HP have this built into their netbooks, but are provider specific).  4) The 6 cell battery pack lets me work continuly between 5 to 7 hours depending on the intensity of the applications I am running.  5) The keypad is the quality of a regular laptop - in other words it does not feel cheap and is responsive to my typing. The keyboard is only 90% of a regular keyboard and my fat fingers can handle it just fine.  6) The Lenovo quick start program gives an instant on and ready to connect to the internet in a matter of seconds. It bypasses the xp boot process.  7) A dedicated one touch backup button.  8) A dedicated wireless on and off button.  9) A sturdy lightweight chasis. This computer looks and feels like a quality laptop.  10) The touchpad works flawlessly. The left and right mouse pad buttons arequality and work flawlessly as well. The other models I tested had finicky mousepads and their buttons were either hard to push, in an awkward place, and very cheaply made.  11) Windows XP runs very quickly on this 1gb memory machine. It made me realize how much of a hog Vista is on my desktop computer.even with 3gb of memory. XP still feels like it runs faster and responds better. That's my personal oppinion.  12) It can be upgraded very easily to 2gb of memory.  13) Upgraded easily to bluetooth.  14) Ubuntu installs flawlessly for a dual boot machine.  What I don't like:  1) The super small right shift key that I cannot get used to. This seems to be a design issue with most other netbookks as well.  2) No bluetooth in the US model. I bought the module on eBay for $14 including shipping and it works like a charm. There are videos on youtube how to install this.  3) No option to purchase with Ubuntu preloaded, but this will easily install if you feel comfortable installing it.  4) No backup disks - I made a complete copy of the hard drive to a pen drive then burned to a DVD. There is a built in one button backup, but I am not sure if this will reinstall the complete system in case of hard drive failure.  5) The built in camera software runs slow on this amount of memory.  I know these machines are made primarily for web surfing, but I use it to do graphic intensive work as well. I use it at both work in the courtroom and on the road for genealogy research. It's ideal for my usage.  Overall, I am very pleased and impressed with the quality of this machine and am glad I made the purchase.  I purchased as a refurbished unit from the Lenovo website for $330.00. It came with a very nice Think Pad carry case.
Good for what I needed  Quick
Nice while it lasted  It was a nice computer while it lasted.  Bought it in September, 2013 and the motherboard needs to be replaced. I have three other HP notebooks that's I've been happy with. I bought this as the Homeschool computer for my grandson.  It performed well until one day when it just went to sleep and wouldn't wake up.  I described the symptoms online to a site where various companies would provide a quote to repair it.  Most of them said it is a bad motherboard;  others said they'd have to take it apart to determine the cause. I ended up buying another cheap HP notebook with an AMD processor... it's not as fast as the previous one, but at least it works. ----------------------UPDATE--------updated to 5 stars----------------------- Sorry, my mistake.  The year was 2014, not 2013. Also, I never did open this computer, it was over a week late and I needed another. I guess I had ordered this one to replace a Pavilion dv6 I had purchased from HP... the one listed here is apparently a later incarnation of the notebook I had that went bad.
good
Came on time and in good condition.  Product arrived ready to use. Good display, good battery.  I wiped the drive and installed Windows 10 successfully.
Astonishingly light and slim. The packaging was beautiful, and I honestly thought the laptop itself was a cardboard top in the package because it was so light. It's fast, has a long battery life, and an absolutely marvelous viewing angle. Even the things I had doubts about (trackpad) I fell in love with after a little use. I'm a student, and this is honestly perfect. Highly recommend.
Small and Powerful!  Only had it a week. So far I love it. Very fast! Love the 2 second awake! Really light and much easier to move around. Love the touch option. Still getting used to Windows 8. It's definitely different but cant say I don't like it. Overall, great little laptop!
Nobody does it like Apple  Absolutely LOVE this MacBook Pro with Retina display. I upgraded from a 2012 iMac (a 2009 MacBook before that) and the difference is stellar. The display is undoubtedly gorgeous, system performance is wicked, and it's thin and light. It just screams. Let's face it, there's nothing that compares to a Mac, but even this takes it to a whole new level. It is SO worth it.  I'm an Apple & Mac customer for life. Not because I'm a fanboy, but because Apple never fails to seamlessly integrate hardware, software, and services in a way that makes every product they produce an absolute joy to use.
Love it! Killed my last computer after 60 hours or more of homework a week!
cool laptop, price is good for the configuration and also the win 10 system. but you need to add a hard drive yourself.
Fast service, great computer!  The computer is solid. It is fast, handles games like a dream and handles all my computing and gaming needs. CUK is a great company to purchase from and they have excellent customer service. Will definitely purchase again.
All is good :D  I love macs! Got one in 2010 and bought another one this year after I gave it  to my sister. Never going back to PC. Everything in order with the product received.
Powerful laptop which meets all my needs! No issues to report after having it for the last couple months! Definitely worth buying!
HP Celeron - My New Personal Workhorse  I write now from the product in question. Since I got it, it has been an absolute work-horse, far superior to any other product for which I have similar use. How anyone could use a Mac as their "Facebook Machine" is totally beyond me. This computer has been one of the best purchases I've made this year. The keyboard is good, the mousepad is better, the speakers are best. Seriously, it's got killer sound for such a dinky computer. Guys, don't be afraid of the color. I'm a guy and the "Peach Coral," though girly in name, is actually a sort of brick-ish orange. I've received a lot of compliments on how cool the color is. Buy refurb, it came in 100% working order and condition with no visible wear.
Most usable laptop I've ever had  I like this laptop better than any other that I have tried. I've always been a desktop person, and I have always thought that the laptops I have had were limited and each came with its own peculiar quirks. They were travel computers only.  This is the _only_ one I've ever used that I felt would make an adequate replacement for a desktop for general use.  I like the keyboard; it's complete without crowding, the surface is soft without being sloppy, it's quiet, and it has backlighting--all wonderful for using the computer while someone else is sleeping.  The touchpad is the first one I've ever been able to use precisely without resorting to at least an occasional external mouse.  I'm not fully used to a computer (as opposed to some sort of tablet) with a touch screen, but already a pattern is emerging of using the keyboard, the touchpad, and the touch screen together as a blended input system in which using each as convenient is almost instinctive.  Resolution is high, and I have seen no screen flicker at all, even while the computer is being moved. Films looked great and ran smoothly. The speakers are good and the sound is clear, but maximum volume as delivered  isn't very loud. It is loud enough for one or three people watching a film, but not for inviting the neighborhood to join you around your living room.  Husband said he could clearly hear what they were saying in _Gettysburg_ from about 14 feet away,  but there was no ambient noise.  Speed--I can't answer for the extremes, being neither a fanatic gamer nor a scientific researcher. It handles photo editing fine. I haven't used it for video editing, but according to the specs it's considerably faster than the desktop, which does video editing without problems (or did, until I decided that if I wasn't getting paid, there were better ways to spend my life).  I ran it on battery twice, just to do normal things. Once it went four hours and forty minutes before it started complaining; The other time it was four hours and ten minutes. That's less than they say it should do, but more than I was expecting; I was happy with that.  However,  it's a bit heavy just to throw in your bag along with all the other stuff you have (it weighs nearly 7-1/2 pounds) and go from place to place. From home to work and back is probably fine, but not carrying around constantly.  All in all, I recommend the machine very highly.  I have tried to review the computer itself, rather than the operating system or the included software, about which I would have other things to say, but it arrived pre-registered for the Windows 10 upgrade, so I look to the future and hope.
Love the size. Easy to travel with. Did not like the Windows 8 it came with
Great Gaming Laptop  awesome!  Fast and runs many games no issues!
I love this computer
So worth it  I bought a netbook a couple of years ago which was completely horrible so I was skeptical to buy another one without knowing what I was getting till it came. I fix computers and the last one I bought broke the next day and when I tried to contact the seller, he was rude and wouldn't do anything so I was out the 200$ plus another $200 for fixing it till it finally died and I had to upgrade. So this price and product left me worried but I figured I'd try one more time because of the reviews of this. It is first and foremost a GREAT little netbook! I use it for school and for work. I watch countless movies and tv on it and its faster than even my desktop! I was really worried it would be slow and break the first day but here it is more than a month later and its working like the first day i opened it! Its super fun to play with all the apps. It has so much power it flies through pages and apps like nothing else. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants something portable, that can fit in a purse and do anything you may need to do but don't want to spend $500 or so on an IPad. This is a fun little machine.
Great Laptop  This is my first laptop and I think I made a great choice.  Firstly, I bought it directly from hp.com and with the rebates I had, saved two hundred dollars. Secondly, I got free 2 day shipping and it arrived on time.  The first thing I like about it is that the color is not the cheap gold look you see in the picture. I love the keyboards on HPs Entertainment and Special Edition notebooks. They do not feel cramped. There have been many cmplaints about the glare of the keyboards on this and the black and chrome models.  So far, I have had no problems with the glare.  Yes, I agree with the other reviewer, that the keys are hard to see in the dark.  I would assume that would be the case for any laptop unless it is backlighted and this is not. It is light (wtihtout the battery), the speakers generate nice sound, it finds wireless networks instantly, and I actually like Vista.  Just a note, read up on accessing the hidden administrator account if you are new to Vista.  It has some serious security that will keep you from making even the most basic adjustments, including removing the bloatware. HP has done a wonderful job in including set up tutorials and online registration processes. The size is fantastic and screen is beautiful.  I have not attached any peripherals up to it yet, so I cannot really comment on that.  Cons: The battery life is short.. maybe an hour and a half even when it in the recommended power save mode. It has a lighted HP emblem on the back of the cover that uses resources. HP could have added the backlighted keyboard instead!  The verdict is still out on there telephone tech service!  I have had better experience with there chat support. The comp does sound like it is working overtime anytime I burn a CD and the vibration generating from drive is a bit too much for me to type at the same time.  This is a great laptop, esp. if you can get it for under $[...]. It has only some bells and whistles, so if you want built in bluetooth and a blueray player, you will have to go up a model.  Otherwise, no reason not to consider this one.
this is the best computer owned  So, this is the best computer owned.  Comparing this to an older MacBook.  This new type of computer is so light.  After using this Chromebook for a month it is clear that Chrome is a solid system.  Took some getting use to, but after the learning curves this computer is ultra modern, and does the job well. Looks good, sounds good, types good.  5 stars.
Great product
We are very happy with it  Bought this for my 7 year old son. He can manuever it well for his homework and games. We are very happy with it. Arrived fast. It was smaller than I expected, maybe the measurements in my head were off. It would be better if it wasn't white. But this had the best reviews and amazing for the price.
Works Great  The reviews of this laptop were very positive. I was looking for a smaller than traditional laptop for recording meeting minutes--something easy to carry around, but not a netbook--too small. When it arrived some keys were intermittent. I suspected the keyboard ribbon cable connection was loose. A Google search yielded a YouTube tutorial of how to change the keyboard. I didn't want to open up a brand new computer, but the fellow said it was quick & easy, just a few clips to release around the board (but very small). Do this at your own risk. Most people would just want to ship it back, and try another. But it was just as he said. The connector was a bit tricky to reassemble, but in a few minutes the keyboard worked fine. I've had no other problems. The processor is pretty fast for word processing and spreadsheets. It's not bad either for photo viewing. The LCD is very sharp and bright. I got a USB outboard DVD drive--no space in the machine, too thin. Battery life 6 hours, super. It think this laptop is a great value.
in love with mac
better price other than to get a brand new one.
This was the Best deal...
great  more appropriate for airline tvl!!!
GREAT buy!  Oh. My. God. I LOVE my new laptop. It is perfect, has lots of power. Shipping was very fast, packaging was secure.
Great Value  I bought this same computer on another site 6 months prior and paid DOUBLE. Very satisfied with the price of this computer. I already knew it would work well but the price was unbeatable!
Android apps are coming!  I am waiting for my Acer CB14 but was thrilled when I read that Google announced at its 3 day annual conference that Android apps are coming to Chromebooks! Initially it is only coming to 3 CB's in mid-June but it will roll out later in 2016 to many others. Acer CB3-431 series was on the Google Chrome support site as one of those. I can't wait! This really changes what Chromebook is capable of.  Update 5-20: I asked Alexa when I would get my order and she replied that it would be "Tuesday, July 5th". I certainly hope she is wrong! '  Update 5-24: It arrived today and in I had it set up within a couple of minutes! As Google knows all my bookmarks and passwords it was a breeze to get started. I'll just have to learn some new shortcuts and commands. I LOVE the keyboard. I'm a typist pre-computer days and I don't look at the keys when I type so back lighting is not an issue (but I am sort in a darker room right now and the light from the screen would seem to be enough illumination anyway). The track pad is fine, too -- I don't understand how it is not slick or smooth enough. At any rate, Day 1 and I am very happy. This is replacing my iMac as my main computer and for $800 less and I can definitely say this is just as good of a product. Thank you, Acer and Google for a stellar job!
The best!  Got a great Prime deal on it. Wasn't expecting much and can't say I knew what a Chromebook really was. It now is my family's favorite computer. It's small lightwieght...IMO better than a Ipad. Love it!
Great
purchased for a friend
First off, this is an amazing laptop.  I've gone from using 400 to 500 dollar laptops, and this is a fantastic upgrade.  Between the i7, the 970, the amount of ram and storage, the hardware on this thing is spectacular.  Gaming is smooth and easy.  I play games like CSGO and BF4, both of which run smoothly, without lag, at high settings.  The only thing is when gaming, the laptop gets loud and warm from running the intense platforms, but there is a button next to the power button that turbo boosts the fans, which though noisy cools down the laptop.  From a design standpoint, the laptop itself looks appealing.  Between the steel finish on the outside of the laptop, to the red accents, its a nice looking laptop.  When typing, the keys feel sturdy, and the backlit keyboard is a nice touch.  I am very much in love with my purchase, and I couldn't recommend it enough to anyone looking to buy a laptop that will play games, and run intensive software at a good price.
A lot of buck--but a lot of bang  It's worth the money. Small, light, fast, and a long battery life. Little extras: the sound is pretty decent, the screen is very bright, and startup time is literally a few seconds. PC users need not worry that it's going to be a pain to transition; the Mac's user-friendly reputation is earned. I did immediately purchase an external CD/DVD drive to make life a little easier. I've been told that having minimal USB ports might be an issue for some users, so be aware that there are only two.  The only drawback I've seen thus far is that it's *so* small and light (literally the size of a spiral notebook, and thinner than that) one might forget it's a $900-plus piece of technology. It almost begs to be treated casually. Those with children/teens, beware: it's toyish in its size and heft, and will invite abuse.
This ultrabook made me keep coming back to it.  I absolutely love this laptop. I did NOT need a laptop. I already had an array of computing devices for every purpose I can think of. But when I saw this laptop (yes even with the price tag) I couldn't resist. I did not have any particular laptop in mind when I entered into the Microsoft store, but after trying out all the laptops at the store, I kept coming back to this one because it was just so pleasant to work on it. I was actually browsing the Internet looking for pros and cons of the ultrabooks and comparison chart, etc. The screen was so sharp and crisp; it was like a different world compared to the other ones around - not just other ultrabooks but probably all the other laptops, ultrabooks, tablet pcs, and even all-in-one monitors. And it looked the best too.  So the pros: 1. The amazingly sharp and crisp screen 2. The look and feel 3. Haswell CPU! 4. The keyboard feels great; just the right amount of resistance and lightness for an ultrabook; and it's backlit! 5. Touchscreen is seamless 6. Samsung bundled software is pretty good to sync with other Samsung devices.  The cons: 1. Price tag 2. Low clock speed on CPU but good enough for an ultrabook! 3. No full size ethernet port - even though it comes with the adapter 4. The location of the SD card slot - the tip of the card sticks out making it cumbersome to keep it in the slot. 5. The finger (or more of the fingernail) touches the touchscreen to open.
Amazing gaming laptop!  Alienware brand stands for itself. I have never had one but always knew they are great, judging from the reviews. And now I can confirm this myself. This machine is a gaming powerhouse. Throw in what you want and it runs smoothly. The laptop finish is impecable. I highly recommend this for every serious gamer!
laptop  this has been a great laptop for my husband, he only had to get use to windows 8, I really like gateway computers, we also have a gateway desktop
Wonderful laptop!!
Very good computer, runs Lightroom great.  I am a full time Photo student at AIP, and got this computer for Christmas (It was ordered by a different account, obviously). Windows rates it a 3.9, because of a low-ish quality video card. I, however, rate it much higher. It can run Lightroom AND Photoshop, as well as an internet browser and two IM programs with only a slight bit of lag. It also is able to run Sims 3 with eight sims per household, and graphics mostly on high. Now it has no Firewire port, but it does have HDMI. The webcam and audio work very good, and the audio quality is beautiful. It can even have surround sound with just two speakers. Like all laptops, the color balance for the screen is not the greatest, but it is good enough to do moderate image editing, and with the HDMI port, it can be connected to an external screen or even an HDTV
Ordered for a friend and he loves it!
Excellent computer!
Awesome for the price  At the time I bought it at least, it was the cheapest laptop with a gtx graphics card in it. And it performs great. After about a month of heavy usage, it has only ever crashed once (after starting up on half battery from a long hibernate). It runs all my games fantastic on high settings (Wildstar, Borderlands 2, Sims 4.) I never go below 40fps on anything.
Great buy!  It more than meets my expectations. Boots up quick, is extremely fast. Love it!
... an Apple so everything works perfectly and it looks beautiful!  Its an Apple so everything works perfectly and it looks beautiful!
Great computer!  Great computer and value for the money.  Does everything expected and more.  I just wish the battery lasted a little longer, but I have no prior experience with computers so I guess two hours is average.
happy  This is just what my brat wanted. Now she wants a new TV. Now I hate computers, buying on line.
Very happy!  My old Dell Inspiron 1525 died in January of 2016 and I had been wanting a MacBook Pro with Retina Display for a while because I had gotten used to the crystal clear, crisp display while using my iPhone 5S. After 5 months of being without a laptop, I took the leap and applied for a Barclay Visa with Apple rewards. I was immediately approved and was able to start using my credit immediately to purchase the 13" via Apple's online store. I debated over the advantages/disadvantages of 13" versus 15". I really wanted something smaller that I could carry around easily. From my previous experience with a 15" laptop, it's more cumbersome to deal with. I choose the 512GB because I needed more storage and was of deleting files to make room. It's super quiet and fast. I also love that it starts up and shuts down quickly. It was super simple to do the initial setup. Coming from using Windows Vista was a change, but I'm enjoying learning to navigate iOS. I am very pleased and I would surely purchase another one when the time comes.
Great computer...  Everything works great. Just a note, if you have trouble with shutdowns and reboots taking forever (5 minutes or more) after upgrading to Windows 8.1, uninstall the Qualcomm bluetooth drivers, restart, then download and reinstall the bluetooth drivers from the Asus support site.  This resolved this issue immediately for me.  The bluetooth works fine, and my shutdowns and startups now take about 20 seconds.  Annoying issue, but easily resolved.
My nephew is completely satisfied with this item. Thank you!
it's great, works perfectly, is just what I needed, and I would recommend to buy
Fantastic Laptop.
Excellent Chromebook Value  I have a few chromebooks and this one is a great value. The price point was excellent for what this computer delivers. I am a big believer in Chromebooks and would highly recommend this one to anyone thinking about getting one. It is always fast and does what a Chromebook should be doing (quick boot-up, using chrome to access the web, long-lasting battery, always updated).
Exceptional gaming laptop  I bought one a month ago and have put the machine through its paces since.  I'm writing this review on it. There are several specs of this model that differ from other computers with the same model number. Most notably, mine uses SATA 3.0 for the SSD (as opposed to the PCIE on some others). I'm am running Windows 10 on this machine. I definitely would recommend this laptop for a certain type of person: a hardcore gamer. This machine runs quiet, cool, and fast. I've had one freeze while playing Doom 2016 (it was the game, not the OS), other than that it has run flawlessly. You will probably want a larger SSD at some point, but the 7200rpm HDD is plenty fast and spacious enough for now. The ASUS ROG forums are a solid and helpful community. Definitely check them out. I would recommend waiting for a price drop below $1600. Mine was $1550 when I purchased and $1520 the day before.
A Good First Laptop  The laptop was everything I hoped it would be and more. I had no great disappointments, except that I wish it had more storage as I'm in university. This would probably be more ideal for high school students. The quality of the Beats Audio lived up to my expectations. Everything was on point. The design, its feel, its portability. Everything was as expected. I have no major complaints. I love HP very much.
A workhorse  I don't give 5 stars easily. But, this one deserves it. Bought it 1.5 years ago and it's still running fine; a workhorse. Mainly used for internet browsing, watching online videos. I also bought another for my sister about a year ago which is also running fine.  The speaker could be a little better but can't beat the price.
LOVE IT!  super fast, light and great. It came before the day it supposed to which is great. I don't have too much time with it, but right now Im happy.
Best Macbook ever !  I bought this Macbook Pro from apple store and now i write some reviews about this.  Design: Beautiful design, ligher than previous version. This version taken out the DVD driver, so this thick only 1.9 cm. To compare with Macbook Air, I prefer this one. As I think new macbook pro' s design is more more professional. Thick enough, light enough.  System: Although with this budget, you can buy a PC with higher system, but Macbook pro will bring back smoothy and fluently in running programs. No lagging, no "Not response" as you saw in PC. Beside that, PCIe-based flash storage take out all the noise. The speed of copy or starting were enhanced very much. This machine is not a realy power machine for graphic user but I use it for work on RAW images fluently. Retina display is the speal feature of this laptop. however, some program display is not good like advertising ~ Maybe they do not have any update for retina monitor.  CONS: 128GB PCIe-based flash storage ~ It not enough for my demand, I wish 1TB :D  These are some things you should buy with this:  Superdrive: <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/B008AL9VXI/dp/B008AL9VXI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">B008AL9VXI</a>  Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/B008ALA6DW/dp/B008ALA6DW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">B008ALA6DW</a>  Mini DisplayPort to VGA: <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/B009K916ZK/dp/B009K916ZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">B009K916ZK</a>
More than i expected  the computer is really amazing i recommend it, Photoshop is really fast, its good for gaming so far i played Unreal TournamentII,starcraff,Rise of nations, saints row 3, Fifa13, Online game: Aion and ragnarock II, so far im loving this laptop
Very pleased.  Fast delivery, brand new as expected. Very pleased.
Econo laptop ftw  I got this on a whim from a local  retailer.  For the price its awesome for browsing and watching vids on the web.  For $170. its fast compared to more expensive tablets/laptops, rends pages better, plays vids good  Only downside is I wish I got one with a larger screen.  The battery life is also awesome!
Awesome Chromebook  I love this little laptop/chromebook. The size is perfect too. Yes, it's internet-dependant, but I absolutely love it for when I'm out or at home and need to do some important internet stuff that I may not be able to accomplish with my phone of tablet. Again, its strictly internet-dependant (in other words you cannot install any type of third party programs/software like you would on a regular Windows computer) but its fast and gets the job done for me. Battery life is a little under the 6-hour battery life statement - it last me like around 5 hours. But again, its ok. It's perfect for me.
Another excellent general-purpose laptop from Lenovo to carry on the Thinkpad tradition  I purchased the R61e to replace my old T30 (which ended up, as my review of that machine indicates, having some significant problems), and so far I'm extremely pleased with it. The 1.86GHZ Celeron CPU is a single-core CPU and therefore not as swift as the latest dual-core CPU's, but it's quite speedy enough to handle any general-purpose business or entertainment work.  As shipped, it comes with 512MB RAM, but can be upgraded to 4GB RAM; Windows XP addresses a maximum of 3GB RAM, so I upgraded to 2GB (using high-quality Crucial brand memory), which allows the onboard Intel video GPU to address up to 384MB while still leaving over 1.5GB for other applications. The hard drive, at 80GB, is slightly undersized but inexpensive external USB hard drives are readily available to expand your storage capacity if needed.  The DVD/CDRW combo optical drive can also readily be augmented by an external USB DVD writer if you need one.  The 15" widescreen display is bright and clear, and only requires 10MB of memory (remember, video memory on this system is shared out from overall RAM) to get full color at 32 bits.  DVD and video clip playback are sharp, clear and smooth.  I even tried Guild Wars (a fairly demanding game, though not so much so as the latest generation) on this laptop and played it successfully for several hours.  The machine is attractively constructed in the classic Thinkpad style, all serious-looking black and gleaming chrome (I've remarked on a web forum that Thinkpads, as compared to other laptops, _look_ like machines on which you can actually get something done!) with the famous "pencil eraser" pointer, the signature feature of the series, riding proudly in its accustomed place in the midst of the large keyboard.  The system comes bundled with a full suite of "Thinkvantage" utilities, including an extensive "Rescue and Recovery" facility which can be accessed at boot time or any time during operation by pressing the large blue "Thinkvantage" button on the keyboard, and a trial version of Microsoft Office.  The installed OS is Windows XP Professional, which is quite suitable to this class of machine and which, in any case, I prefer to Vista, to which I'm still not ready to upgrade for a while yet.  The Thinkpad R61e will work best for you (as it does for me) as a mobile adjunct to your main system, but in that role it's hard to beat.
It feels well built. Performance is also great. I've been playing Witcher 3 on Ultra for the last couple of months, and it's very playable (probably gets above 30fps). I had to turn off Nvidia Hair works and a few other non-essentials (motion blur, chromatic aberration). The fans become audible when gaming, but nothing too bothersome. It also doesn't heat up to uncomfortable levels. Rig details: GTX965m, i5 version
I have been very happy with this purchase  This is the first time I have ordered a computer online and I was a bit septicAL of making an doing so. I have been very happy with this purchase. It is exactly what I was looking for. I would do it again on this dell computer again.
My Son Loves It  I have twin 13 year old boys.  One son wanted this Pro 17 inch Gaming Laptop, while my other son wanted the 14" Touchscreen Gaming Laptop.  We got each what they wanted for their birthday and they are ecstatic.
there is nothing you need to change  great online work and everyone says it just work thanks
Third one I have bought for employees that do development in Visual studio. I need to upgrade from windows 10 home to pro or enterprise, but these laptops seem worth it.
Fits its purpose to a T  Loving it. Serves exactly the purpose it was designed for--  Super fast--both turning on and loading the web.  Incredible battery life--I am only charging it every 2 weeks or so.  Highly portable--can barely notice the thing in my backpack and carry it one-handed all over the place.  All sorts of other cool little perks, too.  Caveat emptor: some wi-fi networks apparently have troubles dealing with Linux-based operating systems (which Chrome is). The connection in my office building is very sketchy (connects at high speeds before stochastically losing connection)--the tech people are still trying to figure out why and address this. That said, without changing any settings at all (on the laptop nor on the router), it works perfectly fine on my home wireless network, so it's not like it's a pain to get it connected to every network.
From a Tech's Point of View  I have had this computer for about 6 months now. When I was looking at laptops, I had several ideas of what I wanted. I wanted  *12.1" to 14.0" screen *practical, sturdy construction *better than average battery life *enough performance to do anything I want to do  I found all of that with this computer. The body of the unit is a blend of plastic and aluminum, giving it sharp looks and a good solid feel to it. This is no featherweight computer, but that's fine because I like my laptops with much more tookus than a Macbook Air. It puts my mind at ease knowing that I won't break it in half. One thing I really liked about the construction of it is the intake vent for the cooling fan is in the front of the unit, not on the bottom. So you can safely have the computer on your lap, bed, pillow, etc. without worrying about cutting off the airflow to the cooling system!  One thing I did notice though is that when I was using the unit for an extended amount of time the left palm rest would get warm enough to make my palm sweat, but this is because the palm rest itself is aluminum and the hard drive is directly underneath it.  For battery life, it is amazing. I have been able to tweak the power settings enough to where I was able to get 10 hours of battery life out of this machine. That was after turning off the wifi adapter, dimming the display, putting a power cap on the CPU, etc. The NVidia Optimus comes in handy for this. When on battery, switch to integrated graphics. With wifi on and surfing the internet, I can usually get 6-8 hours of battery life.  Performance wise, this unit has 2 GPU's that help offset the less oomph that the i3 processor gives. I have been able to play many different games with this computer with almost no lag due to performance issues. I have played Half-life 2, Portal, Portal 2, Rift, League of Legends, and Mass Effect 2 with no problems. When playing games or videos on battery power, I have been able to get 4-6 hours out of it.  The webcam isn't a lot to brag about, but I don't really use it. It does just fine for Skype though. The microphone is pretty poor but the same can be said of quite a few laptop microphones. It doesn't have ESATA or an express card slot, but the average user doesn't even use them. I do use ESATA but I haven't really minded the absence of it on this computer.  The only things I would change with this computer would be *500 GB Hard drive instead of the 320 GB *A matte screen and a matte LCD bezel (picture frame of the screen) instead of the glossy *Inclusion of software to operate the webcam (for some weird reason this isn't included) *Two separate soft-click mouse buttons (meaning buttons that don't give a "click" sound).  If you want a compact, good looking computer that can outlast any other computer in it's class for battery life while wielding great performance, this is the unit that will do it.  Bonus: ASUS gives this unit a 2-year manufacturer warranty, and if you register the unit within 60 days of your purchase you get a 1-year Accidental Damage Protection that covers 1 incident!
Great for the price  Exactly what it said it was.... Could use a bit more ram for the 64 bit OS... But plenty of computer for the dollar.
Favorite computer ever!  Favorite computer ever.  Great size!  Perfect for travel.  A laptop is so I can work on the go and this one goes with you so easily. I use it for Word Processing and other office/work related things.  Love it!
This laptop is very good, Asus has a good gaming laptop, i Play videos games in full resolution.
This machine runs like a dream  This machine runs like a dream!  It can handle all my applications and games without any framerate slowdown!  I'm so happy I got it!
good  Really decent laptop, very fast, good price
I like the fact it was shipped to my house quickly. Thank you. And it works fine to me.
Was looking for ultrabook  I bought this for my oldest going into high school.  she needed her own computer and portability should she need it at school.  This is light weight and with a touch screen you can't ask for a better deal.  It was right at back to school which I think brought the price down to just under $600. Fabulous.
Had it set up and ready to use within just a few minutes. Very light, compact chromebook. Works great
Great computer . God Bless W 7. Lenovo is super user friendly. Will buy it again!
Speedy Laptop  Extremely happy with my purchase!!  The laptop is so fast!  I turn it on and it takes about 2 seconds for the login screen to appear.  Nice big clear screen too.
best laptop in ever bought  I gotta give it a five star rating I use it for writing my books im a . Writer and I just needed a little laptop to finish my book and this was more than what I needed it was great .......you should bye over and ober again
Nice laptop with Low cost and good design. Performance is good. Battery life around 4 to 6 hours.
Love this computer.
Good computer, but Don't buy from Amazon.  Apple MacBook MB404LL/A 13.3-inch Laptop (2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 2 GB RAM, 250 GB Hard Drive) Black  A good laptop overall! Not as much battery time as the G4 and I replaced the battery for this within a week at the Apple store for free. My biggest disappointment however is that I bought it from Amazon as they not only will not honor the rebate that they told me to wait 30 days for... They are now selling the laptop for $150.00 less, and will also not honor the price drop.  My advice is to buy it directly from Apple as they have reduced prices on the item and the service is obviously better.
It's been great  Just got this a few days ago, and so far it has been outstanding. First of all, the initial setup encountered no issues at all. In my experience this is pretty unusual for any new piece of technology.  It just worked, after a handful of setup steps (choose time zone etc). I love the design. SO far I have used it in laptop mode, tablet mode, and presentation mode (which I find to generally be easier than tablet mode). Don't expect to use this like a regular tablet - it's too big for that. But using it in your lap as a tablet works great.  The performance is quick and the touchscreen works beautifully.  I use that far more than I expected to on a laptop.  The only minor nitpick I have is that the hinge could be a little stiffer. Sometimes when using the touchscreen the screen bounces back a bit when you press on it. The hinge flexes a fraction of an inch. If this was a little stiffer, knowing that you'll be touching the screen a lot, it would be better. But that is not worth taking a star off for.  So far this seems like a great purchase.
THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT FOR A GOOD PRICE.
Must give credit to MSI on this one. Full Review  A few days ago I wasn't paying attention and left my Sony laptop on the passenger seat at night, and yeah, gone. This had me scrambling for a replacement laptop, and it had some very big shoes to fill from the lost high end Sony. I'm a tech freak, so I put a lot of thought into these purchases. I wanted something premium. I wanted a full laptop that can be my desktop on the go. I need something I can use in my vehicle on a job site or in a hotel room. I occasionally play the latest and greatest games during down time and wanted something that could give me that option, basically this means I had a requirement of a dedicated graphics card, AMD or Nvidia. I don't game a lot, and mostly it's SC2, so I didn't require the highest performance in this. Therefore I considered lower GPUs almost as equals in my shopping. Basically... I had an unlimited budget. I had every intention on buying whatever I decided was the best option right now.  I give those details to give you insight into my goals in this purchase and where I come from in this review. I researched online for the current offerings, but I was afraid to buy one online without seeing it in person. I was down to a Razer 14 2015, Asus G501, Asus UX501, MSI GS60, HP Omen, Dell XPS 15 9550, and a couple others. I went to 5 different stores to find these. None had more than 1 of them. I didn't find the Dell with the correct specs, or the ASUS UX501, but I experienced all the others.  I was about the buy the Razer 14 2015 at the first store, but I decided to go on the search rampage because despite the premium feel of the Razer, I was concerned about the smaller screen for SC2, the lack of a number pad bothered me, the screen was super reflective (a problem when using in a car during the day on a job site). And add that I knew that was going to be the most expensive of all the options, I didn't want to buy it that quickly with those issues, but I had it in my mind that if I wasn't more attracted to something else, I would come back to get it.  The next find was the HP Omen. Something bothered me about buying a HP laptop because I associate them with budget friendly cheaper laptops, but the Omen was certainly premium. It had it all there, except still no number pad. I liked all the ports in the rear and I liked the build quality. But there was just something about the aggressive design that turned me off. I loved it at first, but I felt like it would age quicker and I'd grow tired of it.  I then found the ASUS G501. It was very nice. In fact, based on the look and feel, I had it in my mind it was the winner and I was going home to order it as the one in the store wasn't the spec sheet I had in mind. I've also been a fan of ASUS in the past. It was nice.  I then found the MSI. I'm glad I went on this due diligence spree because I would have never ordered an MSI laptop sight unseen. I respect the MSI brand, but I've always favored ASUS in desktop components, and in my previous laptop search MSI was just entering the market and they were bulky, cheap, gamer gear looking laptops that turned me off. This one however, is NOT that. It is understated. It feels premium. It is light for it's power and size. It is well thought out. It feels BETTER than the Asus and is spec'ed better to boot.  Serious Pros:  SCREEN QUALITY- It is not a touchscreen (no use on a true laptop), glossy, but not highly reflective. I knew the issues with 4k going in, and would have bought a 1920x1200, like my lost Sony, but none had more than 1080p except 4k. And most of them were highly reflective touchscreens. Seeing a 4k image on your wallpaper looks amazing on this thing. Colors are great. Perfect amount of gloss. KEYBOARD QUALITY- The number pad is great for us that actually use it often, but more than that. This Steel Series keyboard is the best I've ever used on a laptop. The customize-able back-lighting is even an added bonus. BUILD QUALITY - This is a beautiful laptop. I'd say in the same class as all the other options including the Razer. WEIGHT - Beats all the competition hands down. Although I suspect the UX501 is here too. POWER - This is spec'ed as well or BETTER than ALL the other options I listed. One of the few that have the latest and greatest processor and GPU. Most have the 960M which would have been fine for my uses, but the 970 puts it on par with the Razer. It lacks nothing in this department. STORAGE - I think this is the ONLY one that gives you the options for multiple drives out of the box. It comes with the high performance SSD and a large storage drive. This is an option I missed on my last laptop as I constantly had to invest in a bigger SSD because I kept filling it up. PRICE - It is an expensive laptop, but on the lower end of the scale compared to the other listed options. The UX501 and Razer are more expensive. The rest are either the same or slightly lower because of the 960M GPU.  I really like the auto switching GPU that is indicated by the power light color. VERY nice touch that speaks to how well thought out the design is here. I think this is the only one with a good ol' ethernet port. Very nice to have sometimes when you are having wifi issues or reformat and need drivers.  Cons:  None, but a few things I'll note for people who might care. I've never met a touch pad I liked, so I didn't bother with this one. I always use a mouse. I can't say that this one is bad or good because I've barely used it, but it looks good and isn't in my way. But I've read that people don't like it. I would prefer smaller bezels, but in this one you'd have to increase the screen size rather than decrease laptop size to preserve the number pad and keyboard feel. This is why I was looking at the Dell, but I suspect the Dell is much bulkier. The screen is so gorgeous I haven't noticed the bezels. Not a lot of USB ports, but honestly, I had three on my last laptop, and I don't' recall ever using all 3.
Very Good  Great..  The price, the configuration,  i recomended.
Great for me  Surfing the net is my main use for a good laptop.  I don't need a big hard drive to store data.  This little jewel suits me perfectly.
good value, meets my needs  Very pleased with this purchase
Excellent product - exceeded all expectations!  Kids laptop was getting old and school is starting so when I saw the refurbished HP ChromeBook on sale for $199 I ordered it. The laptop exceeded all expectations. It starts up in a couple seconds and once set-up instantly and consistently connects to your WiFi. The Chrome browser that most everyone uses is the operating system for this laptop. If you mostly surf the web, check email and write an occasional school paper or letter this device is perfect. Printing can be a little complicated but if you have another computer on your home WiFi that is connected to a printer or you have a new WiFi connected printer you will be fine. Build quality, sound, feel, fit and finish all were well beyond what I expected in this price range. If you have a Google email account and use their service for storing pictures and files, this is the way to go - order one today!
Happy!  I think I got what I wanted. Service was excellent.
Awsome, Highly recommended!!!  Awsome, Highly recommended!!!
MacBook, Perfect Size & Power  I went back and forth between the MacBook and MacBook Pro. Which one? Will it be powerful enough? Big enough...?  Maybe a Sony Vaio would be better?  I'm a Windows software developer but I'm going back to school for my MBA and I wanted a smaller, simple notebook for papers and internet communication for classwork. It needs to be durable and I need it to work without a lot of fussing around with system bits.  After much research I chose the MacBook over the pro because of the smaller size and the fact that the aluminum on the pro although cool, can dent easily. The matte black finish on the MacBook is elegant, tough, and the build quality it top notch. Does the the black eventually get smears on it from your hands and fingers? Yes it does but just wipe them off every so often. It's not a big deal.  IMO, aside from a few points in processor speed the major technical thing the Pro gets your over the MacBook is a dedicated video card. The card in the MacBook uses part of your system memory and that's not a big deal if you aren't doing complex things like 3D Rendering or gaming. Even most photo editing tasks on the little MacBook will work well *if* you have enough RAM. I recommend 2GB or more.  My MacBook arrived and I couldn't be happier. I personally think the black is nicer looking than the aluminum model. And this thing is fast! It makes my dual Intel Windows tower at work seem pokey. The glossy screen probably has more glare than a matte screen but the trade off in weight and size is well worth it.  Also the built in wireless Airport is great and reception is wonderful. Just turn it on and  available networks show up in your menu. It's really so much nicer than Windows. The bonus is that I can dual boot with BootCamp and run all my Windows stuff when I need to. I installed Neo Office (open source office suite) and now I can open and create all the documents for my coursework.  Don't fool yourself into thinking the less expensive MacBook is less worthy for general computing tasks than the more sophisticated pro. It's very elegant looking and very powerful. If you don't need the power and size of the pro, I think you'll be happy and the money you save can be put toward other things. Maybe a new digital camera?
The Best 15.6" Ultrabook Touchscreen at its Pricepoint  I own three of the latest tablets/laptops and this is by far the best of the bunch in terms of balancing power, weight, and usability.  The other two laptops I own are a Microsoft Surface Pro (too dinky and unstable) and a core-i7 Dell w/ a maxed out graphics card (too big and heavy).  Before I begin the technical part of my review, let me say how I use my computers.  As an information systems & digital media professor I use my computers for basic tasks like writing papers, lecturing, and presentations.  With it's 15.6 inch touchscreen, it's perfect for those.  However, as part of my research and teaching, I also use my computers for programming, 3D modeling, animation, visual effects, digital inking, and video production.  My computers need to be powerful enough to not only run Microsoft Office, but Adobe Photoshop, After Effects, and Premier, as well as Autodesk Maya, and the Visual Studio programming environment.  Rather than just list features I'll describe why I feel the ASUS is better than my other computers.  Why the Asus is better than my Surface Pro: Both the Surface Pro and the Asus S550CA have core-i5 processors running at the same speed.  The Surface Pro has better screen resolution (1920x1080 vs 1366x768).  HOWEVER, the Surface packs 1080p into an 11 inch screen, which is too small to use especially in desktop mode where it's hard to touch the tiny icons.  I find the ASUS's 1366x768 *perfect* for selecting icons in desktop mode.  Of course the Surface Pro is more portable, but you pay for that portability.  It only has a single USB 2.0 port, whereas the ASUS has 2 USB 2.0 ports and a USB 3.0 port.  The ASUS also has a VGA port, which is still the standard when you're hooking up to projectors.  If you want to hook up to a VGA projector on the Surface, you need to buy a $40 adapter.  So to summarize, the ASUS is just as powerful, easier to use in terms of the touchscreen, and has better connectivity.  Why the ASUS is better than my maxed out Dell: the Dell's too heavy and gets too hot.  Yes, when I need speed for my apps and when I want to play games I use my Dell with it's quad-i7 and discrete graphics card.  But the Asus is fast enough for all the applications I mentioned and I only notice the lack of power when I render videos & animations--not while I'm creating them.  Anyway, I don't want this review to get too long. I want to end by saying that I compared the features of my Asus to other ultrabooks at the same price point like the Acers, HPs, and Lenovos, and what I found, to my surprise, was that these other ultrabooks were missing the DVD writer and the VGA port that my Asus had.  You may not need these features, but they're important for what I do.  Bottom line: Highly Recommended!
I love my laptop.
Good entry level chromebook  Bought this for my son as they required a chromebook for class. Solid construction. Decent performance. Lightweight. So far so good.
excellent
Love it  The best notebook ever!!! I really recommend it. I missed the 256GB memory, though :(  But that's ok. Go ahead and get the 256GB
Great laptop!!
Professional  Received the laptop in great condition. Fast startup, open up in like 8 seconds. Kinda have a difficult time setting up the Chromebook though, cause this is my first time that I ever bought these. Look nice and everything with touch-screen and responsive keyboard. However, for some reason, I feel like the mousepad does not respond that well. Overall, the Chromebook look nice, stylish, and small. Good for travel.
Amazing Laptop  I absolutely love this laptop. It does everything I need it to do! The only downside to it is that it has a rather low battery life. Don't forget to keep it plugged in! Another downside is that (obviously) the laptop does not come with an optical drive. I don't really mind it considering I don't even use CDs or DVDs anyways, but for those wondering, this does not come with the hotswap optical drive. I love the speakers on this system as well as the screen. I watch a lot of online movies and videos and when it comes to streaming, this laptop brings the quality I need.
Awesome!!  Beautiful, brand new MacBook! The box was damaged, so I got it for the low price of $639! Its perfect.
I got this mac refurbished and it works like any other mac pro  I got this mac refurbished and it works like any other mac pro! When I received it, it was packaged very nicely and securely which was VERY important to me. The only thing that showed that it was refurbished was a small bump on the corner on the part of the keyboard which wasn't noticeable at all when you put a cover case on it. I have had it for 5 months and I am still in love with it!
Affordable, competent choice for the small business professional  I give this laptop a solid five stars for what it is. I use it as a laptop for business, web-browsing, web-applications, Netflix, and a few computer programs. It does all those things very smoothly and with little problem. I was able to uninstall any bloatware within 30 minutes. Bootup doesn't take too long, and I rarely run into any crashes, etc. The webcam provides good picture that is more than good enough for Skype and such. It is slim, relatively lightweight, attractive, and does everything I need it to do.  If you're looking for an affordable laptop to do all of the basics, this is great.
FANTASTIC LAPTOP LIGHT AND FAST  The base 2012 13" aIr arrived this afternoon and it is beautiful. Its fast. Its quiet. The screen is perfect as is the keyboard. Buying from amazon is great. It arrived in a couple iof days via prime and no tax. Plus a year interest free with the amazon card. Great deal!
5 stars  On time delivery.. prouduct as describe.. works great.. thank you.. my 12 year old son loves it great tool for school.
Great product!  Great item and does not look refurbished. Comes with all the desired cables and in good packaging.
Boooo  I used to love this laptop for the price and all! I had the 1 year warranty on it, and 3 months after that was up my battery broke! I used it for simple school tasks, typing and small searches. Not built to last!!!
Want it
Right Coast is a good company to do business with.  Right Coast listed this laptop in good condition.  It was not.  It was in EXCELLENT condition.  Theres not a scratch on it.  It looks like brand new.  It will take a bit of getting used to, as my old laptop was on Lion OS, but I will get the hang of it. Another thing Right Coast said was that I would get it between the 5th and 10th.  I got it on the fourth.  Excellent service!
Sleek, fun, terrific  I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this laptop due to some of the cons and negative feedback it received, but I am sooooo glad I took the risk and "went for it". This is an amazing, powerful and fun laptop. I provide voice over and video production services and it is perfect for this type of work, as well as, many other fun activities - gaming, social websites, watching movies - it does it all superbly! :-)
Great Value  I needed a new computer and this more than filled the need . I am very pleased with this and at a good price.
Portable bliss for movies, desktop publishing, and more  I've been a Mac gal for 20 years now, although I have to use a PC at work (but it can't hurt to know both platforms, right?). This is my second Mac laptop, replacing an original iBook from 1999, which is still working fine but can't accommodate enough RAM for OS X and things like Photoshop. The MacBook is lighter, boots up in record time (faster than the iBook and my work PC), and I love the glossy screen. OK, I do sort of miss the handle--no matter what people said about the iBook, that handle is helpful when you live in a house full of butterfingers.  No complaints about battery life--I keep AirPort turned off when I'm not online--and I work in some pretty battery-draining programs, like iMovie, InDesign, and Photoshop. The MacBook handles them all with ease, and the big hard drive means I can keep multiple projects onboard and still have plenty of working room.  Love Spotlight (the search widget) and Dashboard--my inner Steve Jobs really hates all sorts of aliases cluttering up my desktop and impinging on my wallpaper. Dashboard has a calculator and a dictionary/thesaurus for my son, and boatloads of free widgets are available at apple.com for the publishing geek (font management, project timers, etc.)  Being somewhat new to OS X and using Windows XP at work, I wasn't sure how Tiger would handle cross-platform files, but I've imported wav and avi files and iTunes and iMovie read them without needing additional software for translation. If I want Windows on the MacBook, I can use BootCamp to have it run native, which would be a vast improvement over the adequate-but-slow PC emulation I had on the iBook under Virtual PC. Because I'd only need Windows to run spreadsheet software for hubby, I'm hoping iWork07 has the long-awaited spreadsheet program.  Hooking the MacBook up to my ancient peripherals was a snap. Drivers for my 8-year-old inkjet printer were native to OS 10.4, and I was able to download free OS X drivers for my 8-year-old scanner and 15-year-old laserprinter.  I'm very happy with my MacBook. Now if I could just pry it away from the rest of the family ...
But she's happy.  My wife absolutely loves this computer.  It's fast, with decent hard drive space.  The only gripe I have is that I cannot stand the OS.  I'll stick with my Win 7.  But she's happy.
I almost return this great machine by error  I almost return this great machine by error. Thank God I change my mind. It's a good product, I have used other products before getting this on Amazon. No regret.
Love the computer  Love the computer. It is an ideal machine, memory and size for what I need. Initially computer had dead battery upon delivery however the seller immediately offered to send a replacement battery within days of taking delivery of computer. New battery was installed and everything is functioning as should be. Seller is to be commended for such service. I am a satisfied customer and would purchase from seller again.
satisfied.  good peformance. and excellent service of amazon.
Great Computer!  This computer has great features, and a fast processor.  I love it! I serves my needs great, and it is great for gaming.
I will NEVER get a PC again  I was always reluctant to switch to Mac even after my sister and friends endlessly talked me into getting a Mac instead of making the same mistake again of getting a PC. I finally did it and I don't regret it one bit!!... I have been using PC since I was 12 and I got used to the Mac in a less than a week! so easy to use and this computer is ULTRA fast! I run Photoshop, Illustrator, Firefox (with at least 16 tabs open) and probably running something else with no lag. Battery life is longer than any PC laptop I know but on a normal use with bright light almost at the max I will probably get 3 hours but when I watch videos it will last maybe 2 hours. Greatest laptop EVER.
Great Linux machine  I bought this laptop to install Linux Mint. Thanks other people mentioned in their reviews that Mint works well on this one. Everything works fine except screen brightness control, I have to use "xrandr --output eDP1 --brightness N" (N from 0.4 to 1.0). Excellent quality for the price. Very lightweight, excellent travel companion. With Linux the battery life is between 4 and 5 hours, but I am developing software on it, so not a big surprise. My favourite laptop ever.
Absolutly love it!  I have only been using it for a few days now so I cannot say to much about the longevity of the machine, but so far I am loving it! Its very small, thin, and lightweight yet very powerful. So far I have managed to play Bioshock infinite, Far cry 3, Boarderlands 2 all on ultra settings unplugged, and on power saver mode, with playable frame rates. Turn it on performance mode and it runs silky smooth. Im getting great battery performance as well, I have yet to record the amount of time im getting with it while playing games or just surfing the web, however I would expect about 2hrs playing games on ultra settings, and about 5 surfing the web at the moment. Reviews have said it can get around 8hrs with the right settings surfing the web. The only downside would be the display, however 1600x900 is perfectly fine display for a 14" laptop, and everything looks crystal clear to me. The sound quality is also decent considering the size of this laptop, you can only expect so much. I am loving the location of the speakers, and the grill that covers them make it seem as if they are not even there. Looks great, anyways if you are looking for a small, portable laptop that is a power house at a reasonable price, im thinking you found it! Wouldn't hesitate to recommend to a friend.
Great Value and Performance  I bought this computer because it was the best value that I can find! $650 for a fast i5 processor, 6 GB of RAM, a touchscreen, and a hybrid SSD/HDD drive is absolutely amazing.  It is a little thicker than typical ultrabooks, but that is OK with me especially since it has more connection ports (4 USB 3.0, Ethernet Port, full-sized HDMI port, media card reader, and even an optical drive).  NOTE: The computer I received does not have a second (mini) HDMI port as described above, but it does have an Ethernet port.  I was deciding between the Inspiron 15z and a Macbook Air, and I am glad that I went with this computer and saved some money.  For being $450 cheaper, the Inspiron 15z has the same Core i5 processor and even more RAM (6 GB compared to 4 GB).  I can also see how the Macbook Air would have connectivity issues with only 2 USB ports.  PROS: -I have not encountered a single bug (computer freezing, touchpad/touchscreen issues, software issues, etc) since receiving the computer a few days ago. -The body of the computer is very sleek and is made of aluminum with a plastic underbelly.  The backlit keyboard looks great and feels great. -The SSD drive is absolutely amazing... the computer takes 10-15 seconds to boot. -The factory speakers are pretty good for laptop speakers and are manufactured by Skullcandy.  They can get pretty loud, which is a plus because I have had issues with previous laptops and not being able to hear clearly.  CONS: -The touchscreen is pretty glossy and reflects some background light which obstructs the screen when viewing at certain angles.  Though this is less of an issue when the screen is set to max brightness. -As someone else mentioned, the integrated webcam is not too great.
Asus Eee 700  We were looking for a compact computer for a trip abroad --We read about the Asus and everyone who had purchased and used one was very happy and impressed with its functions-We opted for the one with Windows XP,which was a littls more expensive,but are very happy that we did since there was no need to learn a new operating system--The computer's small internal(4GB) hard drive is no problem--We bought a small portable external hard drive(160GB) and downloaded pictures,video and audio files directly to it with no problem-Also flash drives can be used to store editing programs to plug in and use when needed-It weighs less than two pounds and is small enough to fit in a purse or small carry-on--Needless to say, we are very pleased with the product and the company(J&T)that delivered it promptly--V Laurini,Sarasota,Florida
Nice laptop computer  After going through all the specs on various computers this is the one I decided on. I searched Best Buy, Tiger Direct, etc.. and Amazon had the same exact computer for $50 less and I also have Amazon Prime so it was a win, win. I like how light the computer is, in the past I have travelled with a laptop and the weight was a big issue. I was trying to avoid buying a Windows 8 system but then I found the app called START 8 so I decided to try Windows 8. Start 8 makes your desktop identical to the old Windows 7 so I didn't waste any time going to Windows 8. System is fast, starts up very quick and screen is very clear. Keyboard is nice and responsive. I don't rarely use the touch pad so I can't rate how I like it. I also like the battery connection to the laptop. My old Toshiba had a loose connection right from the start and didn't like it. The battery life is also pretty good. If there is one thing I could change it would be a longer power cord, it could use an extra 2 ft. I would recommend this computer to others.
A value for the brave-We are not all techies...  Even in an effort to be brief, I was blessed to be a tech for a Fortune 500 in 1982 when the first IBM PC came out, or, the Apple II-e, prior to any Mac. I tend to think a lot of you if you may be reading this, if you were in grade school then, there was a joint *Gift* venture of some kind with my company, and Apple to put a *Black Apple II-e* in every grade school library, (Not the beige ones they sold). I am an oldster with back ground, but, at the same time, I bet Middle School kid would have done better than me. If you know how to find things called *DNS numbers* and *IP numbers* from your Internet Service provider, and, can figure out where to put them in the software in this little guy, it will work. It will connect to your wireless router. I am not sure what it would do at a *Hot Spot* on the road, I have never really used those places. It took me 5 hours to get it to fly, but it will do the things I want it to do, without question, which isn't a lot. There are at least a couple good YouTube discussions on what it *Will do*, but not how to set it up. In addition to what I *Know* it will do, I am *Fairly sure* I will be able to *Link it to my cell phone*, pay that provider as little as $15 / month for unlimited Internet. That is clearly a maybe at this point. Still, for $100 new, 1 year warrantee, and purchasing from someone reputable you can return it to if you are disappointed, it is well worth the price. Alternatives for *My uses* would have been about 3 times the cost... Thank / John +
New laptop  So far a great laptop.
Sub $1000 gaming beast!  PROS: Best price/performance power ratio for under $1000.... period.  Dual GT 750M graphics powers through most games and sometimes performs better than more powerful single cards (comparable to GTX 770M).  Back-lit red keyboard is geek sexy.  Plays MOST games at high/ultra settings at 60 FPS.  Overall design is sleek and stands out without being gaudy.  Best built-in speakers I have heard on a laptop (have owned 4 and my wife has gone through 2).  CONS: Takes some work to get some features working properly (Optimus, Turbo Boost, etc.).  Buggy WiFi software/drivers included cause issues (see Other Thoughts).  Stock cooling setup doesn't handle CPU/GPU under heavy load very well and temps can get high on certain games maxed out (Bioshock Infinite, Crysis 3).  Trackpad is one of the worst I have personally experienced on a laptop.  Lots of unneeded crapware/missing useful utility software pre-installed.  Other Thoughts: This is ALMOST the perfect Steam gaming laptop! This machine is ideal for Steam and direct download gaming services as it has no optical drive and replaces it with an Ultrabay secondary GT 750M GPU for extra performance. Now, if you think you are just going to take this laptop out and connect to Steam out of box, you may be disappointed. The included Intel ProSet Wireless software is crap and doesn't play nice with Intel N Centrino card on certain networks (N Wireless). I had done my research and just uninstalled this Intel software (you don't need it). I also uninstalled the included drivers and let Windows install default generic wireless drivers and it worked fine. Then went to install newest drivers off Lenovo and forgot to uncheck the box Install Intel ProSet software. Steam could not connect error after install. WTH? Uninstalled software and now working perfectly. Nothing wrong with the WiFi card (5-10 minutes to fix but a pain). Now, onto gaming performance which is why you're probably looking at this. This laptop plays most games in High/Ultra settings without breaking a sweat. Some benchmarks on games tested so far:  Alice Madness Returns (Settings maxed, PhysX Medium): 30 FPS cap Bioshock Infinite (Ultra/No DDOF): ~60 FPS (see below) Dark Souls (DSFix SMAA & AO maxed): 30 FPS cap (no SLI) Dishonored (Ultra/maxed settings): 60 FPS DMC Devil May Cry (Ultra/maxed): 60 FPS Elders Scrolls V: Skyrim (Ultra preset): ~60 FPS  Now, I said most games this thing doesn't break a sweat, but if you enable Turbo Boost (Lenovo disables by default if GPU is under load) and play Bioshock Infinite the temps soar. Mine got so hot that I saw frames dip to almost 0 momentarily and then recover, a sign of real world throttle due to sensors recognizing ceiling allowable temps. I exited out and reset back to stock base clock (no Turbo Boost) and made some tweaks using Nvidia Inspector to control temps and no more overheating and FPS performance went up. Lenovo should have had a better stock cooling solution (better heatsink, more efficient fans, Arctic Silver Thermal Paste!) in place instead of disabling a built-in OEM feature on the Intel chip. Just lazy. Most games not affected by CPU power, except Battlefield 3 MP and Crysis 3 on certain settings.  That being said if you're using this just for gaming and not doing photo/video editing, complex math equations, flight simulators, using certain emulators  (PCSX2, Dolphin) or other CPU intensive tasks, I suggest you save your money and your temps and get this beast over the i7. Take the money you saved and invest in a decent bluetooth mouse and a laptop cooling pad, or even better- a good priced SSD. This will up your performance and bring temps down further due to no HDD spinning. So why with some of these faults did I give this a 5 star rating? With some tweaks/mods (non hardware) this thing performs like no other laptop at this price (~$900-1000). Overall, I am very pleased with the gaming performance of this laptop and at this price ($879 at this time) it can't be beat!
Excellent for any purposes. Had this computer for 8 months now and no issues.
Great buy thus far  It's a MacBook Pro, need I say more. I will be able to give a technical review when I am able to fully utilize the audio software for which this device was bought.
Easiest product ever.  Love the Acer chrome book. So simple and easy to use.
GREAT PRODUCT, BEST PRICE !!!  This computer is perfect to use with my LCD TV. I don't need and external Blu-Ray player for my LCD just the Laptop.
I love my new macbook air  Great little laptop. Clear screen, easy to use and great size. Fast delivery.
This is a great little computer  This is a great little computer. It is easy to carry around, and the resolution makes it really easy to see. The battery life has been good, and it works well with Ubuntu. It worked fine with Arch, but it took me about 2 months to get it working due to the weird bios and uefi. I am presently using the unauthorized Gnome version of Ubuntu, because I am not a fan of Unity. It has worked quite well. It also runs Mint easily. For most users, I would imagine the stock Ubuntu 14.04 LTS will work best. It has a restore partition like windows, and easy to set up. This is well worth the money.
XPS13 blows everything else out of the water!  Great laptop!  Well worth the $$$.
LOVE IT!!!!!  This Laptop offers you great Speed, Power and Performance. It runs like a dream. I give it two big thumbs up. Its Money well spent.
A definite cool little machine  Awesome value for a college student who just needs Firefox and the Microsoft Office Suite.  It gets the job done and is ridiculously portable.  I dropped it hard and it took it like a champ.  Battery life lasts only about 4hrs when working on it constantly but who needs more per day for a net book.  But literally will charge half a battery in 20 min.  If your dinosaur of a laptop broke(Myself) and you are looking for something in between the library and other computers this is the best $250 I've spent on a computer.  Plus I get a lot of complements on the white color!
Great!!!
Very high Performance/Price ratio.  I bought an ASUS N53SM-ES72 six weeks ago. If you come from a smaller res display (ie 1280x800 or smaller) you'll be blown away by its Full HD LED display. Together with the 2GB Nvidia video card for performance and Intel's HD 3000 integrated video for power efficiency make for a great combo. Sound system is pretty much OK! The keyboard also feels good (no flex at all). I was hoping for a better touchpad experience though, but it's OK anyway. Do not expect multitouch feature to work as smoothly as, say, on an Samsung Galaxy smartphone. It comes with a hidden recovery partition and an alternative mini-OS ("Express Gate"), very useful if you're in a hurry and your Windows suddenly croaks. Only con IMHO is, if you want very good portability, look elsewhere: it's quite bigger and heavier than my 14.1" laptop. But once in your desk, it really shines! All in all, it's a sleek, fast, powerful system: great performer for the price.
I think it's a nice size for use as a tablet  Have had it a few days now and I am liking my choice to get this 2_in-1 computer. There is a learning curve for Windows 8 but I think it will be worth the time. I think it's a nice size for use as a tablet, and as a full computer with the dock and the extra storage it offers. Will definitely be better than my full size laptop when traveling.
good
Excellent  Very fast processor. Plenty of main memory. Excellent usability. I recommended the same commuter t for 5 friends all are happy
More Features, Longer Battery Life, Same Great Retina Display  Like many people here, I looked at both this model and the newer 2016 Mac Pro 13.3".  I tried both out in the Apple store---several times---and came to the conclusion that this 2015 model had more features that I wanted than the newer model.  Besides being $200 less than the new model, I liked that it allowed me to use my devices that use USB2 and USB3 ports---the new one doesn't unless you buy adapters.  it also has a bigger battery which on online tests show it gives roughly two hours more than the substantially smaller battery in the newer model.  Apple insists they both provide 10 hours (12 for iTunes on the 2015). This means I'll get more use per charge than if I got the smaller battery in the 2016 model.  The keyboard on this one is superior to the clackety one with little tactile feel on the 2016 model.  I've been a typist for 55 years and though I can type well on both keyboards, I prefer the softer, quieter and apparently more reliable scissor-type on the 2015 model.  Online issues seem to turn me off the new "butterfly" keyboard.  I also like the Touchpad on the 2015 model.  The oversized one on the 2016 seems to catch people's wrist movements and cause errors. The newer model is brighter, but I never go about 45% on my display so it would be lost on me.  One feature I do like about the new one is that it turns on when you open the lid...saves wear and tear on the Power On button.  The weight difference is less than half a pound so that was not an issue for me.  For me, the 128GB storage is more than sufficient.  On my iMac with 1TB, I still have only used 30GB with my iTunes, documents, apps, and security camera operations, so  I know 128GB will not get used in the years I have this.  The final positive of this 2015 model is the MagSafe plug...a blessing and to cut costs, Apple did away with that and the USB, HDMI ports on the smaller 2016 model.  As someone else said, this is likely the last fully compatible Mac Book as it seems Apple is paring down features and I wouldn't be surprised if the headphone jack will go next.  Update:  6/12/17:  Working perfectly.  Been getting approximately 11-12 hours per charge.  I don't do gaming but I surf and use iTunes and some security camera features.  Never gets warm either so I am thankful for that.  My military retailer matched another local retailer's price so got this for a bit over $1000.  Great laptop.
looks and works great
My 8 year old loves it
Very happy with purchase, but this Laptop is BIGGER Than you think it is! Its big!  I wanted to write more of a detailed review for this Laptop, to help those looking at it make their decision easier. I purchased this from Computer King, and the buying experience had a bump but worked out well. My initial order with them was cancelled, but when I did some research I found out that they oversold the model with the specs I wanted. I ordered it and decided to wait the 6-10 days for it to ship, since it had to be made to order. I was in contact with one of the Reps from Computer Upgrade King and to my delight after I informed him I placed the order again, he emailed me the next day and told me it was shipping that morning. I was delighted to hear that! It arrived in the window indicated. Now when I open this Laptop up as other readers stress it is HUGE. It is very bulky, and if you are carrying it from one room to another, you should use 2 hands. I am getting this mainly for gaming, and my other Laptop is an 11inch MB Air thats used for email and internet. Different ends of the spectrum. This laptop came with no documentation what-so-ever, but that is the fault of ASUS, not CUK. I emailed CUK and they promptly returned my email and directed me to a website where I can download the users manual.  Going from the Keyboard of the 11inch Air to this is like night and day. The full size keyboard is a dream come true. There are a few things I am noticing about it though.  -My MB was silent, you can always hear the fan on this, albeit its low.  -The keyboard on this Laptop has a lot more "clacks" to it than the Keyboard on the MB Air.  - The battery life is a joke. It really is. You know that when you buy it. But when your on the Internet and after maybe 10 minutes you have 85% left or 1:30 is annoying. I don't expect to go gaming without a Charger, but none the less a better battery would be nice.  -THIS LAPTOP WILL NOT FIT IN A 17.3 INCH BAG that Amazon or Caselogic sells. This laptop is just too big. It would be nice to find a Carryon that can fit it without forking over a lot of cash for the ASUS ROG Backpack.  I will update more as I use this machine more, but in closing I will say I am very happy with the Laptop, and when I use it I feel like I am using a Desktop. the 17 inch screen allows for window splitting easily and the Webcam is even HD. ( Didn't know it came with one )
I was initially unsure about buying this but now that I have used it for a couple of weeks I find it quite handy. It is lightweight, quiet and has all of the functions I was looking for, or required. A definite worthwhile buy.
like this laptop  this is a good device mouse a little funky but this is just a little funny but this is a good laptop
awesome product!
Love it!  This is the coolest laptop I have ever used! I love the touch screen and keyboard combination. I get to pick how I want to use it that way. The speed puts my old laptop to shame.
I love it!  It's an awesome computer. I don't know what else to say. I've been using the computer every day for the last 2 and 1/2 weeks with zero problems. I haven't even needed to add in the extra RAM I bought because the computer has been running smoothly. It's lightweight and I've noticed doesn't run hot. Love the keyboard. The screen resolution is great. I'm not a high tech computer user, so it looks great to me. I do have an issue with the text in the Google Chrome browser. The text is really small. I've tried to fix it, but nothing has worked yet. I think it's an issue with Chrome though, because I've used Mozilla and Microsoft Edge and neither of those browsers have that problem. As some of the reviews say, it doesn't have a light that indicates when CAPS lock and Num lock is enabled. A minor issue. All an all, a great buy for me. With the extra RAM, I only spent $394. A steal!
Great netbook, has the potential to be a fantastic ultrabook alternative  I bought this netbook off of ebay as manufacturer refurbished, but Acer had amazing ratings on there, so I trusted them. :)  My netbook came with only 2gb of ram, but everything's the same.  I gave this a 5/5 because anyone who buys a machine like this should know what to expect. It's not going to be a powerhouse replacement, it's intended to be light, yet speedy and capable to to do everything you'd do on a main computer. (This is replacing my actual computer, though, mind you)  The HDD is what one would expect from 5400rpm. It's quiet, meaning not annoying--you'll still hear it when the room is silent, and it doesn't give off much heat, unless you're doing something drastic like running many programs while sitting in a hot room. With Satan.  The processor is speedy, don't underestimate it. Of course it's only 1.4ghz and it's dual-core, but it's very capable. I've done my research on netbooks, specifically their cpu's, and this is one of the best. Don't buy any other model unless it can compete with this one. I believe this one tripled, maybe even quadrupled, the performance of the amd processors that the other models have.  The screen is great on here, although things do appear small--but hey, it's an 11" screen. And not only that, I'm used to using a 42" 1080p tv as my monitor. The issue is remedied with a bit of tweaking of settings and sites. Not a problem here, but be aware! If you're worried text might be a bit too hard to read, than browse the 13" laptops. You'll probably find a screen more to your liking. :) Just make sure it's a solid package.  Keyboard is awesome, I'm very happy with it, though I do miss my mechanical keyboard. =/ It's no fault to the netbook, so I kept the 5 stars as it is, though if I were to demote a star, the keyboard would be the reason. After comparing the key sizes to my old one and my little brother's 15.6" laptop, the keys are definitely smaller, though the spacing in between them is roughly the same. Other than that, it is pleasant to type on! :D One of the most important parts of a good keyboard, to me, is the size of the enter and shift keys. :) I am a writer and this is one of the most important things I need and I need it to function well and comfortably. (Take note, this isn't a very comfortable keyboard to play games with)  Let's move on to how well this machine can play games! League of legends, it is capable of running at 60 fps, though it will dip to 30-55 more often than anything. Before this netbook, I would play the game with a 5770, six core processor, at 1080p at 60 fps and I can still comfortably play my matches on this netbook, though the latter is preferred. ;D  Torchlight 2 runs EXCELLENT on here and I assume Diablo3 would run the same, but I was surprised Team Fortress 2 did not run well on here, so take not of that if you plan on playing games akin to that on here.  Overall, for games, this thing exceeded my expectations. If I can play LoL and Torchlight 2 (And any other games akin to those), I'm a happy camper, albeit I should be working rather than playing games...  One last thing before I move on to my upgrades, the netbook handles temperature well. It is only a machine, though, so it won't be ice cold. Don't expect that. =/  ------------  UPGRADES!  First thing I did was installed 8gb of ram by Crucial, which is the same brand of my Solid state drive. The expanded ram helped A TON with multi-tasking, which is what I always do. As of now, I have 7 chrome tabs open, music playing, steam downloading games, and I'm writing this review. I can easily alt-tab during League matches just as well as I've done on my desktop. So I payed about 30 bucks for the ram and it was well worth it. :)  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DZJQQI/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00  Right after that, I installed my trusty Crucial SSD 128gb! This is where I ran into trouble though. First off, the ssd itself was a tad too thick, so I had to void my warranty and slim it down a bit by taking the spacer off the middle and using electrical tape to keep it a tight package. I checked the area where the tape presses against and it's fine, though I do check up on it occasionally for a worry-free mind.  After the installation, windows didn't detect the drivers the netbook needed to do anything internet related--even being connected via ethernet cable didn't work, so I just downloaded the drivers using another computer and transferred it over. I should've been smarter than the computer and downloaded all them prior to the upgrades, but I have an excuse.  I didn't think of it.  After all that, everything is smooth sailing. ;D I now own a netbook I am proud of and I didn't have to pay over a grand for an ultrabook!  I hope my review helped!  Update: January 2nd, 2012 I've removed one of the 4gb ram slots out of the netbook because 8gb seemed to be overkill. :) I would've left it in there, except the extra ram was generating more heat than I'd like. It was nothing serious or out of the ordinary, but I'm trying to see how long I can keep this laptop running optimally. Who knows, maybe this'll become my daughter's first computer when she grows up. And, you know, exists in the world. 4gb of ram seems to be plenty as I've never even utilized 8gb during my normal usages, which always involve multiple tabs of chrome, music, videos, downloading, games, some video editing. :) So hopefully this little update will help anyone interested in this netbook. Pertaining to everything else, it's all running amazingly still. I also downloaded a little program called TwoFingerScroll that makes the touchpad awesome to use. :3
Great PC. But Windows 8 is a pain.  Excellent buy. No issues with the performance. Just a bit of a task to get used to Windows 8 after getting used to Windows 7.
This is a great laptop. The sound quality and screen quality is amazing.
Great laptop  Love the way it works and feels. I like the large cear screen.  Easy to setup and use.  Windows 8 works well
The chrome book is everything that I expected it to be.
excellent condition, function, and Value
great product
Awesome!  Finally... This build is everything I was looking for. Solid state HD, blu-ray, dedicated graphics, back-lit keyboard, windows 7 with windows 8 disk if you wanted to "upgrade" even though I haven't come across a single person that has anything good to say about windows 8.  Anyway, I've only had this for 2 weeks, but it is super fast, didn't have much bloatware to remove, and has handled any game I've played easily. I don't play anything like warcraft, but based on what I've played, I know it would be able to handle it just fine.  The only con is the battery life. I'm still giving it 5 stars because I read about this in other reviews outside amazon. You can play with the power settings, but utilizing all performance features, don't expect much more than 2 hours... 3 hours tops if not running anything remotely demanding. This didn't really concern me since I wasn't looking for ultra-portability, just something around the house or whatever where using the power outlet isn't a big deal when needed.  If you don't need extra long battery life, I would highly recommend this unit.
Laptop works great, super slim easy to carry on trips battery life could be a little better, but works great running Adobe products and memory  intensive programs.
Bigger than expected!  Excellent!  Bigger than I expected.  I hooked it up to an old LCD TV and it is now my primary home computer.  Fast and easy to use!
Please give me rufurn girff care  Non good
AWESOME  light, durable, and blazing fast. this ultrabook had everything i was looking for and turns heads in lecture. i love the keyboard for typing but came with some easily removable bloatware. i love this laptop, has all the right specs and all the right performance 5*
I like it  I bought an Ideapad G550 five years ago and it still works very well for my daily work. One time I dropped it on concrete floor and it survived with only one corner broken. So I bought this one without hesitation. I would say this one is more stylish and more powerful than my previous G550. The Window 8 OS includes some preinstalled softwares, some seemingly good but some seemingly useless to me.
Great machine  This is a great Chromebook and the red is red not pink. Otherwise this is a pretty standard Chromebook.
Excellent display. Very light for size  Impressive machine. Very quick startup. Excellent display. Very light for size.  Plenty of power and storage for 90% of most tasks anyone  does. Internal battery cooler than expected. Audio is good. Bluetooth to external speakers , great.
As promised shipped fast great laptop for the money.
Good choice  It's light, versatile, fast the perfect size and a pleasure to use...especially with the other Samsung devices that I have.
Amazing computer for amazing price
Happy with computer.  Very good computer, good performance compared to its price, the only drawback is the difficulty of installing linux causes your disk format.
Outstanding value for the computer. Great condition for refurb.  Very impressed with the computer. It's not fully ruggedized, but for what we'll use it for it's gonna be great. It has 8GB of RAM and an i5 processor so it's quite snappy. Eventually I'll put an SSD in it. The Windows 7 Experience rating is 4.8 overall. Due, of course, to the video. But this time it's the Desktop video performance; the 3D performance is actually a 6.3. The CPU is a 7.1, the memory is 7.5 and of course the hard drive is 5.9 (until I install that SSD).
this is a great laptop.  for the price, this is a great laptop.
Excellent product delivered quickly  Excellent product delivered quickly.  I am very happy with this purchase and am enjoying how the Y50 fills the differing business, gaming, and recreational browsing applications I have thrown at it.
one of the best laptops i have used  this laptop is amazing and for it price it's even batter . i got it about 5 weeks ago and i like every bit of it . it's amazingly quite you can barely hear the fan is working but believe me it really works it dissipates the heat very well . performance-wise the laptop performs perfectly and the connectivity of the i/o is amazing you have HDMI and VGA and thunder bolt / display ports and you have for USB 3.0 and an amazing SD card reader with a speed up to 80 MB/s and a beautiful  screen . and the laptop looks amazing this is the best mony i have spent but it has some cons and the biggest one of them is that it comes with pre installed windows 8, yes you can upgrade to 8.1 but it still windows 8, i fixed that problem with downloading  staretsback which is windows 7 full start button with that beaing done i now like windows 8 it's faster then 7 and it does not get stuck like 7 . back to the laptop thanks to the 256GB ssd the laptop is fast really fast and i replaced the 1tb HDD with a samsung 840 evo 1tb SSD now i can really have fun with it. basically if you need a "budgette" laptop i could not think of another laptop other then the asus it has a very good build quality and nice sound as well but with that the headphone jack has some hiss to it but for me that was not a problem because  i'm using an external sound card.
Acer  i WAS LOOKIN  I was in the market for an inexpensive laptop for my son to use in school. This was so easy to use. Basically plug in and go. I was thrilled that this laptop has all the bells and whistles that my teen needs for school. Easy to use as well This will be easy for any teen to operate. I love speed and the thin design overall of the computer. Overall its a great for doing homework . The thin design makes it great for putting in a backpack or a book bag. Great price as well.
A great buy  Great laptop the touch screen is amazing I don't regret getting it
Excellent product
Really nice machine!  I bought this as a second computer primarily for my wife who is computer averse, but she is really enjoying it.  It has preformed so far as advertised and as being easy to use.  We have yet to put it to the acid test.
As expected
Actually not mine but my brother is 100% satisfied
well worth the money  This laptop is great. It can handle any game that can be ran on a console. Computing power is definitely not a problem with this machine. The battery is pretty amazing as well. It lasts 3-5 hours depending on the task at hand. Overall, great laptop.
I wouldnt say its the best computer to get for gaming nowadays  Im leaving a review years after having purchased this computer.  This computer helped me with a lot of work i needed to do at the time, and while it wasn't capable of playing all of the games out at the time i got it, it did allow me to play many games i wanted to, and use emulators and the roms/ISOs to go with them.  I wouldnt say its the best computer to get for gaming nowadays, but it is very reliable. Its good for everything else, whether hard work or for casual use. A very good computer. If you do have or get this and hope to game on it perhaps considering buying a few parts to upgrade it, because it is still a very good computer.
this lab top is a fantastic buy and I'm currently playing gta v on it  Yes, this lab top is a fantastic buy and I'm currently playing gta v on it. It week handle pretty much any thing given the right internet connection and graphic settings. Buy this
Excellent computer for the price
Its Apple.
great price  love it  still had original packing tape on it what a saving.
Stylish and practical  It's very thin and lightweight. Lovely metallic finish and white backlit keyboard with a 10 key. Very stylish. I love the soft keys. On the left side is a power button, volume buttons, sd slot, and USB 3.0 port. On the right side there are two more USB ports. There is no Ethernet port, CD/DVD drive, or removable battery, which is part of the reason that it's so thin. When you fold the laptop keyboard and mouse stop working, so you won't be interrupted.  I'm enjoying this a lot so far. However, I find the power settings to be slightly bewildering. "Balanced has a darker screen than Eco mode does. Eco mode makes the screen brighter, but turns the backlit keyboard off. Interestingly, the screen automatically adjusts its brightness relative to the lighting in the room.
Loveeee the laptop
This laptop works great, is fast and light. No problems or complaints.
I love it  I have the Ubuntu version of this. I find it very intuitive, and much less trouble than Windows ever was. It's cute, and inexpensive, and does what I need it to do- burn CDs (with an external drive), let me type up fiction stories and journal, and make up for the things my Kindle Fire cannot do. The added bonus is the size. It happens to be adorable, and I like adorable things.
Best laptop ever  -Incredibly thin and lightweight -Battery life lasts a VERY long time -8GB RAM is perfect - Any more seems to be a waste for my needs -256GB SSD is a great medium between cost and size. Of course a 512GB would be nice, but I have an external for media files anyway. -HDMI Out - Essential component that many "budget" computers lack (This is definitely not a budget computer) -Three USB3.0 Ports - I never use more than 2 at a time anyway, but I understand that some people will need more ports. Personally I prefer to use Bluetooth so there are no wires. -Serves as a good desktop replacement  Below are some questions people often ask me about it:  1)How hot does it get? -It feels pretty hot when I play certain games like Crysis 3 on max settings; however, I checked the CPU core temperature only to realize it was actually cooler than my previous laptop had been. I believe this may be due to the bezel being made out of metal which can more easily transfer heat than plastic.  2)Can it play games? -This is always my favorite question because it's a gaming laptop and people love to ask if it can play games. In short the answer is yes. So far I have run into no problems playing games except with radial flora shadows on Battlefield 3 and motion blur in Crysis 3. Both of these settings need to not be on extreme or the FPS take a hit.  3)How is the battery life? -Great! Best out of any laptop I've ever had. I'm sure this is directly correlated with the new Intel Haswell processor that is inside since Intel's big selling point with this generation was lower power consumption. While playing games I generally can get about 5-6hours on battery and doing low power tasks such as browsing the internet and typing a paper I get about double the battery life. It's hard to get an exact number, but with my screen brightness all the way down and battery saving options enabled I was able to get a good 14 hours off one charge. Sure screen is a little harder to use with the brightness so low, but eventually your eyes adjust and it's fine.  4)Are there any weird "quirks?" -When I first purchased it I noticed the internet was a bit spotting. I avoided using the built in NIC card by using a USB Wireless Adapter that I used on my desktop, but what's the point of having a good laptop if the internet doesn't work well on the go? So I did some research and realized my Killer drivers were out of date. (Of course--it's always a drivers issue!) After fixing that I haven't really had any problems at all with the internet.  5)How long does the laptop take to turn on? -People ask me this all the time because my last laptop had a dual-raid SSD so it could boot in about 7 seconds. This laptop (thankfully) can boot in about the same time. I haven't really timed it, but if I push the on button then grab my laptop mouse--the computer is on and at my desktop before I've put the mouse case back in my bag. Any faster would really be a waste considering the work it would take could go into improving something else.  6)What did the Windows Experience Index place the laptop at? -The base score is a 6.9 and here's the breakdown: o Processor: 7.8 o Memory: 7.8 o Graphics: 6.9 o Gaming Graphics: 6.9 o Primary Hard disk: 8.1  7)Did it come with any bloatware? -It depends what you consider bloat. There were no programs such as Norton's Anti-Virus installed; however, there was some of the Razer software such as Razer Comms and Razer Synapse 2.0 installed. I use these programs so it wasn't a big deal for me, but I could see where someone else might not want them.  8)How is the screen quality? -When I was looking to purchase the laptop I definitely considered it a downside; however, since the screen is smaller it doesn't really make much of a difference at all. Coming from a 1080p screen on my last laptop I don't really notice the difference at all. Of course there will always be people who claim they can see the difference, but speaking per inch a 17.3 inch screen with 1080p resolution is 127.34PPI, a 15.6 inch screen with 1080p resolution is 141.21PPI, a 15.4 inch screen with 1080p resolution is 143.05PPI, and a 14 inch screen with 1600x900 resolution is 131.13PPI. With that being said--I'm satisfied with the screen. Sometimes I feel like people are chasing pixels they can't see. . .  I think that sums up my review. If you have any questions please leave a comment and I will reply to it as soon as I can.
Great seller and product  I received the MacBook and it was better than I had hoped for, no noticeable scratches or damage, powered right up and the battery is in good condition, thank you honeytech for an honest representation of a great product, and for answering my questions in a very timely manner
Great
Excellent
The Best Laptop Ever  I love this laptop. I was diagnosed with a Degenerative Disc disease. The doctor said that carrying too much weight will cause more pain in my back. After buying this laptop the pain vanished thanks to this lightweight notebook pc. Weight plays a negative factor when it come to notebook pc's. If anyone want to undue the increased back pain get this laptop and you'll see the difference. However, the hardware and software are excellent as well. I am a member of the U.S. Air Force and I travel a lot. My Averatec laptop go everywhere I go with no problems as far as connectivity. Most of all my back feel terrific. It's really pleasing for a consumer to enjoy the pleasure of his/her product without any uncomforting expectations. I've told all my friends and co-workers, they love this laptop too.
Great Value  This dell computer was a great value for the cost. Out of the box and since we have had no issues! Fast delivery.
So far so good.  I don't love windows 8 but I like the computer itself. Good sound, runs my computer games without any glitching or buffering. Internet explorer doesn't work for s*** but I'm going to get chrome and see if that helps. I don't think its the laptops fault. I like the winter blue color. Very pretty. I received the laptop when I was told I would, it was packaged properly and not damaged at all. Overall, very satisfied so far.
Not a Mac but super solid for he  Been using this for over two years now as my primary computer as a full time student.  Not a Mac but super solid for he price
Dell's XPS with touchscreen was made for Windows 10  I bought Dell XPS 13 with touchscreen after thorough review of all competitors. I choose the i5 processor with the 256GB SS at $1,399. My needs relate only to academic work, research and writing, with trips to registry of deeds, libraries, or archives. Therefore, I needed a light, but sturdy laptop. However, I bought from Dell directly because I have an account.  The XPS 13 with touchscreen was made for Windows 10. Its design, touchscreen, and incredible screen resolution exceeds Apple's MacBook Pro with Retina, the XPS weighs less by one pound, and cost $100 less - now $200 less at Amazon. The performance of the Dell and Apple machines were reasonably close; however, I preferred to stay with Windows and Dell.  Over two years ago, I bought a Dell Optiplex desktop and learned to check for updates - it's automatic or you can hunt for the updates. I've had no problems with my desktop, and I can vouch for Dell's updates and access to technical expertise at its website.  I bought my XPS during a July promotion and received a 32" LG HDTV at no cost. Only downside was waiting for the Windows 10 upgrade and Dell's revisions. I learned Windows 8.1 with several online books before upgrading. As it turns out, Windows 10 appears with the dual incorporation of 7 and 8.1 into an interface the user can pick from optional interfaces and functions.  With Amazon's current pricing, I highly recommend the Dell XPS 13" with the touchscreen. Carefully consider your projected needs before picking the processor and storage. Unlike other users whose needs were immediate and critical, I had the time to wait for Dell's revisions. I did not encounter any difficulty or technical shortcomings. It appears Dell and other vendors had problems with Microsoft's new release.
Very Nice Quality  Very Nice Quality Laptop - Clean, attractive appearance, fast processing, crisp display. A good, dependable machine and a nice break from the typical big chain computer brands. I am not quick to give all five stars but have found no reason not to for this product.
yay  really love this I really hope this last through school. I have been looking for the perfect laptop for my school life I believe this is it:). I am actually writing the review from the laptop so YAY!
Way better than another macbook pro.
Chromebook meets expectations  I have considerable experience with Windows computers, so I was curious about the Chromebook. It meets all my expectations, (remoted to my desktop with Windows 7).  Enjoy the instant on, off and the complete lack of concern for viruses.  The build quality is sufficient for the price range, the screen also is adequate.  However, the entire laptop, desktop, monitor market ought to be at least 1080p by now.  Kudos to amazon.com for another faultless transaction.  Oh, and not part of this rating, throw all congressmen out of office NLT tomorrow.
My friend said it works perfect
Classic Chromebook with Frills  <div id="video-block-R26X0K64K1MEVV" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1U4rYDREMS.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vX%2BdcJacS.png" class="video-slate-img-url">&nbsp;Acer's new Chromebook 11 (CB3-11-C670) should come as highly recommended for anyone expecting a classic Chromebook look and feel that's enhanced by an Intel Dual-core 2.16 GHz with burst mode Celeron processor, USB 3.0 and HDMI (nicely placed on the back) and super-speedy 802.11ac Wi-Fi.  A lot of its specs are 'standard': 2 GB RAM, 16 GB SSD, 11.6" 1366 x 768 resolution but it looks and feel good, with a nice, light (2.65 lb), thin (0.73 in), fingerprint proof body, standard Chromebook style keyboard. The 8-hour battery life is not 'the best' but it's good enough to last for one day of typical use and then maybe some. As all Chromebooks, you get 100 GB of Google Drive storage, free for 2 years.  My experience with Acer's Chromebook 11 is that of a responsive little machine that should handle most 'media consumption' tasks such as movie watching. If you want to do 'productivity', I had no problem going through and handling my email and, thanks to Bluetooth and the 2 USB ports (USB 3.0 and USB 2.0) it's easy use it with mice and keyboards. I didn't try it myself but, with a monitor attached through the HDMI port, it could be made into a nice desktop-like appliance, if so desired.  I view this as a great machine and 'I love it' (5 stars) because:  - Stays true to the traditional Chromebook 'low price' expectations. - It's way faster than the first generation of under-200-dollar Chromebooks - Has all the nice ports for good expansion - Supports 802.11ac which can get you very fast Wi-Fi (over 500 Mbps on this one) - It's pretty overall __________________________________________________________________  For anyone new to Chromebooks, here are some of my thoughts that may help one decide whether 'a Chromebook' would be a good choice/  WHY A CHROMEBOOK AT ALL?  There's so much to say here but let me make a quick summary. And never forget that we are talking about an 'around 300 dollars' device here because, yes, anything that costs 3-4-5 times as much should do SOMETHING better or very few of us would pay more for such devices.   My Chromebook is by far my most used computer excluding work hours and by 'computer' I mean PCs, laptops and tablets.  Malware, spyware, adware-free. Since nothing is really 'installed' on a Chromebook and not much is physically stored on it, it would be very hard for one to be infected. I am in fact now using my Chromebook to open suspicious emails or click on dubious URLs that I don't dare touch from a laptop.  Extremely safe OS. I don't know if this is common knowledge but Google is constantly challenging hackers to crack their OS. As far as I know, Chrome OS wasn't cracked yet.  Easy to share among any number of users without any concerns of compromising privacy. If you have a Google account, you simply sign in and you are going to be within your own, personal environment.  Constantly updated and upgraded. Google updates Chrome OS every few weeks and I found my Chromebooks actually getting better all the time rather than slowly fall into obsolescence.  Nearly maintenance free. Whenever I don't use a tablet or even a laptop for a while, they tend to get very busy once I turn them back on, downloading and installing various patches, updates and upgrades. Not the case for Chromebooks. Whatever upgrades may take place don't hit my Chromebook. Whenever I call up an app, I get it in its latest version.  The attached keyboard helps a lot. Yes, you can pair a keyboard and even a mouse to a tablet but the Chromebook's keyboard is always there, it negates the need of a stand or even some protecting case.  Chrome OS is streamlined and efficiently focused where it matters, on the everyday uses most of us need a 'computer' most of the time.  Chrome OS being such a streamlined one, browsing and running apps on a Chromebook is in fact faster than off a PC/laptop/tablet of equivalent specs.  Relatively low prince, 11.6" display and light weight seem to be just about right for something that typically you'd be using to browse the Web while watching TV or take to and from school.  WHY NOT A CHROMEBOOK?  True, Chromebooks can't do everything. Google's productivity suites notwithstanding, Chromebooks are best at media consumption rather than production. Nobody should buy a Chromebook and expect to be able to edit video or do some hard-core gaming. There are other machines and devices for such tasks. My experience is that a Chromebook can't do 'everything'. Tablets are more portable, PCs and laptops are more powerful and versatile but, to me, my Chromebook is the most fun to use and it's likely to stay this way. I am not going to call it my 'second' or 'third' or 'first' computer but, objectively, it's the one I most use outside business hours if what we measure is 'hours'.
Perfect portable second computer  I bought this to supplement my Macbook Pro, and I absolutely love how portable and efficient it is. It's tiny and light and I can just throw it in my purse with some books. Also, the battery life is spectacular. These days, most netbooks have similar specs, and I ultimately chose this one for its looks -- I really like the matte black, and the shell is sleek and clean-looking.  I'm a college student and mostly use it for word processing, internet-ing, and listening to music--it does all of this beautifully. I have the files all synced with my other computer (via Dropbox, which I highly recommend) and it's so easy to go back and forth.  Although I'm really a Mac person, Windows 7 is not bad, and even Windows 7 Starter does about everything you really need it to do. I think my only complaints about the machine would be Windows related -- like there are obviously a lot of junk applications taking up some space, and for some reason it needs to inform you every time you plug in your headphones ("you have plugged something into the audio jack" -- I KNOW!). The one other complaint I have is that it doesn't have bluetooth... but I knew that in advance and it hasn't been much of a problem. Otherwise, I definitely recommend this netbook!
Little monster takes care of grad school  So I'm a CS undergrad and currently in Grad school doing information studies. I spend long hours on campus and sometimes in classrooms that do not have power outlets. Carrying a bulky laptop and charger, while still dreading power drain is not one of my happiest thoughts of the day. In comes chromebook with features that cover 80% of my campus needs. Note taking with Evernote, Email,  Word processing(all the 'useful' features of word are there in word online) , Excel etc. everything is now available online and the chrome browser functions perfectly. The chromebook helps me function almost exactly with what my laptop did. Except of course I cant code on the browser(yet).  This has been one of my smartest purchases recently. The C201 looks slick - smooth and sleek finishing, a rich strong texture, crisp lcd and a great keyboard to go with it. I love typing on this baby. My campus needs are taken care of, and i can carry this lightweight monster everywhere ! 5 Stars.
Lightweight, Hardworking, Get One  Use this for school, running Windows 10 and the various apps the school requires. (Hey, why standardize when you can let each instructor set up assignments in tech they don't really understand how to install or use?) This is my in the backpack, around the town, connect to any wireless portable library. It's not Alienware, but it does a good job of browsing, accessing Canvas, and creating graphics-intensive projects without bogging down into uselessness. It's the perfect size to balance on your lap on the bus, and it's light enough you won't need a chiropractor by Spring break. There are just enough USB ports to handle dongles to mouse and headphones. Buy or borrow a portable disk reader if you need to load a CD or DVD (I know, ancient tech). I get about six hours of continuous web use or YouTube assignments out of it, then need to connect the power cord to whatever outlet I'm near. It charges while I sneak a latte and a scone. Owe this laptop my GPA!
laptop  I purchased it for my grand daughter.  She love it and it meet all the needs for school this year.
Asus prime  with asus on its prime, no doubt that this machine is a newborn beast! bought this in a very low price and I was surprised that I can play high end games in this laptop without delay!
I have had good luck with these HP's  I have had good luck with these HP's. I really like the touch screen and laptop functionality. No issues yet so...5 stars
Practically perfect in every way!  I am thrilled with my new Lenovo computer.  I was dreading a computer change, but my steadfast 2006 Windows Vista laptop was getting slower and slower as my frustration became greater and greater.  I knew it was time for an upgrade.  Setting up this computer is quick and easy.  It's attractive, substantial and very, very fast.  I couldn't be happier.
Perfect laptop for 2018  Amazed at the quality, speed, ease of use for the price. Fantastic bargain.
love it really fast, portable and cute!
Amazing  Simply the perfect laptop out there, as a gamer i am very pleased. A lot of software spam though. Can play anything on high/ ultra
Great Laptop  I really love this laptop. It's sleek, responsive and takes pretty much everything I throw at it without any problems. The reviewer complaining about the graphics card must not know what they are doing because it works flawlessly for me. My only complaint is that the usb 2.0 ports were kinda difficult to deal with, when I first started using them. The 3.0s were fine, but the 2.0s had to be "broken in".
Very Good
Met every expectation  I ordered this laptop a little over a month ago and it has met every expectation I've had for it. I watched reviews on youtube, I read practically every review of this product online I could find just to MAKE SURE that I was getting a multimedia laptop that could handle some heavy gaming. I have to say this thing is a beast. I run Skyrim at max graphics with an ENB and it runs flawlessly, and it can run GTA5 online without so much as a hiccup. The only thing I want to change about this laptop is the matte black metal finish. It looks nice, but it catches oil and smudges like crazy. I've had it for a month and the amount of oil and smudges I've been constantly wiping off make me feel like a cheeto-munching neckbeard. Other than that, SOLID 9.5/10 machine.
Powerful Features, Casual Interface  As a user interface enthusiast, I feel that a computer should be bought first based on the interface and second based on performance.  Luckily the Macbook Air 13" beats my expectations on both fronts.  This Macbook Air was clearly made for Mac OS 10.7 Lion.  Having used Lion on an older computer without one of Apple's new multi-touch trackpads, I originally thought it wasn't a very big upgrade, but this MacBook Air proved my original thoughts wrong.  It still retains all of the power of Snow Leopard, and adds some new functionality too, while making everything seem much more casual and personal.  Four finger swipes between spaces and full screen apps is the best way to go about a handful of tasks at once.  Mission Control can quickly organize the most cluttered workspace.  There are also tons of nice little features that really make the computing experience seem much more natural and refined.  Over time, you'll start spotting small differences that really make a big impact in usability like being able to zoom into webpages in safari, holding down a letter on the keyboard to bring up accents, and letting Quick Look run in the background. The immediacy and intimacy of apple's iOS operating system has been brought over, making simple tasks like checking email, browsing the web, or writing a document feel much less constricted.  All of these things, of course, get the benefit of a bigger screen and a full qwerty keyboard.  My first thing that struck me about the computer physically was just how compact it was.  Even now, whenever I pick it up or plug in a cable, I'm surprised about how much they could fit in such a tiny body.  Of course, there are some sacrifices to make it this thin, but nothing that has really bothered me too much.  No optical disk drive (more on that later), no firewire, no HD FaceTime camera, no external battery indicator...  These are all things found on the MacBook Pro line, but are absent from the Air and aren't horribly missed.  One concession that might bug people is in the keyboard.  Although it's backlight (which is much more useful than it sounds), the travel of the keys in about half of that found in traditional MacBook keyboards.  It bugged me a bit at first, but after just a few days it wasn't really an issue anymore, but if you're still on the fence, it's one thing to keep in mind.  One thing to note is that if you're looking for a day to day computer, the 11 inch macbook air will probably feel a bit claustrophobic to most.  The 13 inch screen is definitely a breath of fresh air for me because feels much larger than it actually is.  Having used a 13 inch white plastic macbook for the past 4 years, I expected the screen to be similar, but in use, it's vastly better.  Colors look brighter and blacks look deeper, but the big difference is in the display's pixel density.  The 13 inch Air ships with a 1440x900 resolution screen, matching the 15 inch macbook pro pixel for pixel, but at a smaller size.  This makes texts and graphics look much crisper.  I've found that the interface in general has much more room to breathe than on the 1280x800 resolution screen found on previous 13 inch MacBooks and the current line of 13 inch MacBook Pros.  Someone looking for great connectivity features might want to look at the MacBook Pro line as the MacBook Air has only two USB ports, and SD Card Reader, Thunderbolt port, and auxiliary in/out.  However, I've been surprised at how little I really miss the CD Drive.  If you're already seriously considering this computer, it's omission shouldn't be too much of an issue, especially if you share files mostly through SD cards, flash drives, or emails.  Of course, a $79 Apple CD Drive can be purchased and plugged in if you really need it.  It's definitely a good idea to get one now if this is going to be your only computer, but since the world seems to be going further away from physical media towards downloads exclusively, I could see that CD drive collecting dust a few years down the road.  I'd also like to note that wifi performance has been stellar so far, being able to pick up a stronger signal in most places than my phone or previous computer.  Inside in Air is 256gb of flash memory and a Core i5 ULV processor, making the computer feel quick and zippy.  After Effects and Illustrator, two extremely large and intensive applications, boot up with unbelievable speed.  If you're going to use this just for light tasks and small applications, this computer packs more speed and power than you'll ever need.  Even if you're into more intensive applications, you'll still be pleasantly surprised by the performance.  While it's clearly no super computer, anyone who casually likes to play with the Adobe Suite, even monsters in it like After Effects or Photoshop, won't be upset.  As expected, rendering takes a while, but any slowdowns you might encounter aren't enough, for me at least, to get frustrated with the computer.  I've yet to experience an app crash, even Adobe After Effects, which used to force quit every time I tried to close a composition on my old MacBook.  The Air feels like an obvious extension of both the established Mac line as well as iOS. When I had an old baseline MacBook, I couldn't imagine living without an iPad for simple tasks, because the old computing experience was so restricted and confined, but after using the 13 inch air with all of its OS X Lion glory, I completely understand why people wouldn't want something between a computer and smartphone.  Using the MacBook Air is the first time I've felt as engrossed into a desktop interface as I have with an iPad.  Everything about it feels more fluid and comfortable than any other full computer I've ever used.  When Apple announced the new MacBook Airs and killed the white plastic MacBooks, I was really confused, but now I fully understand their actions.  The white plastic MacBooks were the cheapest computers they sold that could do everything the average consumer wanted.  People bought them because they could do a lot for less, but with the matching price point of the MacBook Airs, they suddenly have much less appeal.  The great specs and power of the MacBook Air prove Apple's commitment to quality across all levels as it takes the position as the cheapest MacBook.  The MacBook Air is the first computer I've used that does everything I need it to and disappears when I'm using it so I can focus on what I'm doing.  Overall, the MacBook Air is a strong choice for anyone looking for a computer to use day to day and maybe even for a bit of serious computing.  Although in the future, it might be reflected upon as a transitory device in the convergence of iOS and Mac OS, right now it feels like the perfect combination of the two.  It's both comfortable in use and powerful, making the entire experience feel "just right."
Amazing!  Exactly as described. Showed up on time. I'm loving it!
Very good laptop  I like the backlit keyboard, the processor is fast and the laptop has a good design. I recommend this laptop.
Great laptop!  I really like this laptop.  It has everything I need and it wasn't too expensive.  Toshiba is a good brand.  Thank you very much!!
Great travel computer  I wanted something light and easy to use and for a good price.  I got all of it with this.  I'm very happy with this product.  The battery life is pretty good and surfing the net and checking email.  Doesn't hurt that I use a lot of Google products already.  Definitely a good deal and great way to be productive on the go.
Fast computer. Makes work a breeze!
For my wife  I had just  got one for myself, so I got this one for my wife, Great PC, still working on Windows 8, We don't like it.
A Full Featured Laptop in a Netbook Size  I've been working on this Elitebook 2530p for over six months and it performs like a champ!  I upgraded from an 10.1" netbook to the Elitebook that features a fast Intel processor, a hardened 160 GB hard drive, enough RAM that I haven't felt the need to add more, a built in DVD-RW drive and a battery that has a good 7 to 8 hours of staying power.  What follows are some of the things there were not disclosed to me before I purchased this EliteBook:  * A built in fingerprint scanner (super cool!) * A descrete pop up LED keyboard light that has been installed in the top edge of the monitor screen's frame (also really cool) * A rollerball type mouse button that's built into the keyboard with an extra set of mouse buttons.  Above the row of function keys is the HP Quick Launch Bar which has LED indicators that allows you immediate access to many of the EliteBook's top functions with just a single tap of your finger, such as:  * The HP Info Center, which is a dashboard like application to the EliteBooks major features/programs, * An on/off switch for WANN and Bluetooth reception, * Pop up access to the HP Presentation Settings panel, * An instant Silence button for the netbook's speakers, and * A pop up volume adjuster that allows you to modify the volume level with just a simple swipe of your finger tip - no mouse necessary!  To go even one better, these LED "buttons" change colors to show you what state they are in!  Also on this Quick Launch Bar are lights for Cap Lock, Print Screen, Num Lock and Scroll Lock - indicators that are missing from many netbook keyboards.  As I was getting to know my new EliteBook and all of these "extras" were revealing themselves to me, I felt like, and still feel like,  I got ahold of a great, compact laptop with all the fancy bells and whistles that I could have asked for and I am very, very pleased!
Awesome  I love my new Chromebook...a Christmas present to myself. It does almost everything that I want it to do. I use email, news sites, social media and movie sites a lot. Chromebooks seems to take care of all of that. The computer looks great and handles well.
Love It!
Great laptop for 600..gigaport ethernet  Great laptop..gigabit ethernet...5400rpm is slow but I upgraded to an SSD and this puppy loads in 5 seconds flat. Processor is awesome for what I do which is web site development and flash programming. THe current memory is 2X2mb 1006mhz but upgradeable to 2 X 4 1333mhz ddr3 ram sticks which makes this thing FLY. Amazon likes to raise and lower the price of this product daily but if you are patient like I was you can pick it up for 600 like I did one random morning at work while looking at the current price to see that there was a lighting deal currently on it. 600 and I was stoked..100 for memory upgrade 200 for ssd 128mb upgrade and you have yourself a macbook pro killer for 900 bucks.
Buena!
Nice laptop and cheap
Great laptop for school or home use.
This computer is amazing! It started in a flash  This computer is amazing! It started in a flash, and started up all of the games I have thrown at it so far on the highest settings with no problem. The battery tends to drain fairly quickly when gaming and such, but putting it on power saver mode helps, as well as altering your graphics settings if you want. The speakers aren't very loud sadly, but they do the trick, and you could always get other speakers to connect to it. HDMI port, FOUR USB ports, backlit keyboard with adjustable brightness settings at the top of the keyboard. Volume and screen brightness settings are up there too as well as a game hub quick launch button. HUGE HUGE HUGE computer. Took some time to get used to, but now I wouldn't have it any other way. It stays firmly planted on my lap or anywhere I put it, and really is the size of a small TV! It can multitask like nobody's business. I have had it for a little over a month now and am completely satisfied 100% with this choice. I looked at MANY computers before deciding on this one, and it is amazing. My first gaming computer, and it blows my desktop out of the water relentlessly. SO much space for everything you could ever imagine. Dual fans keep it from getting too hot. Usually, it barely even feels warm, even after HOURS of extensive gaming. I work online at home, take classes online, and game online, so this computer has had to be tough as nails to handle my constant use of it. It has excelled. I am IN LOVE with this machine, and I hope that I have it for many, many years to come.
Light, Efficient and Well Made.  It's a nice notebook!!!  ^_^  I've got a tweaked 3.0Ghz HP laptop that took the place of my desktop which I love, but this is the first notebook I've tried.  It's not made for editing and encoding 1080p DivX, but it's so lite and thin that your barely notice it.  It's got a great battery life, a nice textured touch pad and a comfortable keyboard.  So as far as most of the Windows 10 software, short of Heavy Video Editors go.  It's a great notebook and for something this thin and light it's smooth and solidly made.  I've only used it for a few hours and I already like it.  ^_^
Great computer  I like the speed, the keyboard, and everything else that others have complained about.  I was sick to death with Windows little quirks on my other three laptops.  I just thought I would have to live with the pain,  This computer does not operate using Windows.  I had no idea when I made the purchase.(I bought based solely on price) I even attempted to cancel the order after I did some researched, but the item had already shipped.  I have a tendency to do things backwards!  I am however pleased with the performance of this computer.  My only problem with it is the fact that you cannot attach a printer to it.  That however is really no big deal because I have three other computers that I can print from.
Laptop  A reasonable compact laptop, with a limited memory and storage, just right for a schoolkid like my nephew to take his work to and from school. nice and light weight. It does the job efficienly, no frills.
In love  Just received this today, but have already spent a good amount of time with it. I absolutely love how easy this thing is to use, and I love that you can use it as both a laptop or a tablet. Only negative thing I can think of to say is that the mouse can be a bit irritating to use, but is bearable.
Very good Laptop. Liked it
Best deal evaaa  I bought this laptop six months ago for about $230, and in terms of value this is prob the best deal you can find. The stock hard drive is quick, but for $60 i bought a Ssd and this laptop is blazing fast. The intel dual core processors work at their full potential with the ssd, it runs like an i7 with hard drive. Also the placement of the intake/exhaust fan vents are perfect for using on the bed. In total i spent about $300. Snappy, modern looking, and bang for your duck.
Totally Thrilled--from a life long DOS/Windows User!  I bought two Apple MacBook Pro laptops and could not be more pleased.  A little bit of a learning curve for a Windows user, but I love the operating system.  No doubt there will be more Apple Mac systems in my future.
great  Over a year later and still running like new
2016 Dell Inspiron 15 5000 Premium 15.6" HD... Dell Computers  Works great & not too heavy. Easy to start up & charges pretty quick & holds long charge as well.
Great for a College Student  Bought this as a gift,  Works exactly as advertised.  Not a laptop, more of a Google-book.  Runs all Google software and aps. Openoffice software instead of Microsoft software, very similar and keeps the cost reasonable. A day or so spent memorizing the keyboards shortcuts would be very well spent, I'd definitely look into more Chromebooks in the future.
Great choice   Great design and shiny colors. back monitor cover jet black color and keyboard opening the size of laptop with silver metallic color. With performance from Intel i7 Processor,8GB Ram and 1TB HD this laptop is on level for professional use depending on job you doing.
Great machine, it has so far performed as expected, really happy with the purchase!
Worth the Wait....  Received my back ordered 16GB  4GB Ram last week and love it....the screen is beautiful, worth the wait for me.  I don't care for the white but I knew that when I ordered it.  I have a Samsung Chromebook 11.6 to carry around and wanted this for at home... This screen reminds me of a Sony Bravia  LCD TV...I purchased in 2005...expect that is 720 and this is 1080....TV still works...that TV was about 3,000.00 then...things have changed.
Works perfect. Comes with everything  I am starting college soon and wanted a computer that I knew would not get a virus and crash. So I researched and came accross this one. It came with all of the software needed to go straight to my online classes. It does have very minor and hardly noticable scatches but not on the screen. Very easy to set up and get on to my wireless network. Easy to navigate. I am usually a PC man but now I love my MAC.. Thanks! MAC FAN!!
It's great  The touchscreen is great, the ram and processor are what sold me on this computer and I am glad I bought it. Internet explorer is causing problems for me so I downloaded chrome and that works great. The multitude of ports were a must have and are also awesome. Overall I would say this is a great purchase.
Good!
No more Windows for me  I bought a $300 windows 8 laptop on Fred Meyer and I could not even use the Word that came pre-installed with it. Later I tried to download the latest Office from my MSDN subscription and it installed but when I ran it, it would try to stream the rest of the installation, making it look buggy and unstable. Also for lack of some font it would not open some of my Word files correctly. I returned the laptop and bought a Samsung Chromebook 550 for my wife (she loves it and won't depart it) and a Macbook for myself. The free Apple word processor (Pages) opens my word files correctly. No more Windows for me.
All around great laptop!  This computer is my 2nd laptop purchase and I'm amazed how great and fast it is. I have a desktop that was $1200 and this laptop is proving to be way better than it. If you are in search of a great laptop you found it. I especially liked the processor on it when looking at it and even though it gets pretty hot sometimes it still performs good. I play games that require a lot of processor and ram and the games play just like they would on a alienware or a asus. Plus, the 500gb hard drive is very nice.
Great computer.  Yes, I actually own this beast. Extremely fast, very quiet, not quite light enough.  Coming from MacBook Air I find it slightly too big. However the performance greatly makes up for it. Basically this thing performs as well as mid-line MacMini with 8 GB RAM  and is extremely portable. Fits into the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Twelve-South-12-1102-BookArc-for-Second-Generation-MacBook-Air/dp/B004L9M0B8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Twelve South (12-1102) BookArc for Second Generation MacBook Air</a>.

SUPER LAPTOP  NO PROBLEMS HERE WORKS GREAT
Dyed in the wool old windows users loving their new Chromebook 2  My xP machine died and so it was a good time to move into the modern world.  It's going well.  I was amazed how easily we could upload our Excel spreadsheets with no issues, connect our old printer as a cloud printer, set up  two users, and get most of the functionality we are accustomed to.  We aren't all the way there yet but I am amazed at how it is going.  I am sure it would have been more difficult for us to transition to some newer Windows version.  It's too early to know how it will turn out but it sure is encouraging after just two days.  Update.  It's nine days now and we absolutely love it.  What are we doing with it?  Watching streaming videos on an external printer, Managing our photos including uploading, editing, organizing.  Blogging and using my photos.  Browsing and visiting all our usual haunts.  Downloading data.  We are both Excel lovers and we uploaded our spreadsheets with no problems.  We also shared them between each other, choosing read only or read and write access.  We haven't found much we cannot do and do better.  Our Chromebook is faster than our old PC's.  We are sharing the Chromebook and one of us almost always has it in use.  One warning:  some of the help topics, even those from Google,  are out of date and confusing.
Would buy again.. Its perfect for what I use it for.  I bought this used out the door for 291.00 from Amazon - EaSy Electronics vendor and I have to say I am completely satisfied.  The item was described as good condition but it could have easily been described as new condition.  Would buy from again. So far the product works PERFECTLY.  Please note that this tablet will barely run without the 100+ updates that it will require from sony and microsoft.  Make sure to install all sony updates first.  After the updates its as smooth as butter.  For web surfing, movie watching, word processing, note taking etc this thing is exactly what you would want.  I am a power user when it comes to computers and very knowledgable.  That being said I would never buy anything to replace a desktop pc except for another desktop pc.  Why would you drop 1000.00 dollars on a "desktop replacement" that will never function as a desktop replacement.  I'm never going to do any serious gaming/editing or whatever on a tablet no matter what is underneath the hood. Lets be realistic.  I have read all of the reviews and it is clear that the ones who are complaining either have not updated the firmware on the tablet, have a defective unit or are the type who would return an entire meal at a restaurant because there was no ice in there soda.
Could not be more pleased  I had been a Mac user for nearly six years before my MacBook decided it wanted to be put to pasture.  The computer worked great; the battery not so much.  Since I started working almost exclusively with Google Drive, I decided that I had to check out a Chromebook and the Acer 720 came up as the most popular.  There is a reason for this.  It could not be a better bang for your buck.  I love everything about it.  The size, weight, how far the screen tilts, boot time, comparability with every file I took off my Mac.  It performs so well that I can't figure out why they don't give them to kids at school.  I'm trying to raise the cash for one for my 7-year-old as we speak.  Do yourself a favor.  If you just need the Internet and to be able to write, watch YouTube and maybe play a game, get this Chromebook.
NICE, FAST AND DURABLE  NICE, FAST AND DURABLE
Trackpad needs work  This is a great laptop.  Perfect for those that operate solely on the internet.  I found that my MacBook Air and iPad2 had extras that I typically didn't use on a regular basis.  I also found that when I used either of them, I was only using the internet.  But, I don't believe that this Chromebook can completely replace them both. With my Air, I have access to various tools and applications that rely on the file system to load and run.  There doesn't appear to be an organized file system present in Chrome.  There is some level of storage because it does allow you to download files like documents,  music, photos, videos, etc.  Attempting to run an executable like VLC, another web browser, iTunes, etc will not work.  The Chrome store does have 'apps' but most are just browser extensions or page links.  Just image having a computer and not having access to any part of Windows, OSX, etc. except the web browser.  You also do not have to worry about virus protection, much like a Mac.  With a Windows PC or netbook, you need to centrally manage your virus protection. For mobility and apps, nothing beats the iPad.  The Chromebook screen is a couple inches larger and it has a physical keyboard.  Even though the touchscreen interface is the future, I still value a physical keyboard.  The keyboard is great and has specialized keys at the top for the browser.  The screen resolution isn't quite as good as the iPad but that difference is negligible.  There is no need for updates as this is accomplished in the background or during the initial boot. And again, no reason to worry about viruses (on either device).  The boot speed is unmatched; even a bit faster than my work MacBook Air.  Shutting down is quick, too.  The major drawback, on this model anyway, is the trackpad.  Until you start using it frequently, there is little friction at first.  You have to give your fingers a bit more of a push.  It also isn't always as responsive as the iPad's touchscreen.  Plug in a USB mouse and your golden.
Good product !!!
Wish they still made it  Got this for my wife in 2011, she's on it more than i like but is still running strong. No issues other than the power plug has gotten a bit loose, but it still works. Like the blue color and still looks good too. I've seen people mod these and make Hackintoshes out of them.
Very Happy!  I'm beyond happy with this purchase. Let me start by saying I bought this more to play around with ChromeOS and to see how viable Chromebooks were not expecting to like it as much as I did.  With that being said, if you do the majority of your work on web based apps then you're going to have no problem using this every day.  My main problem with it is that apps like Dropbox just redirect you to the webpage and don't actually offer a good app experience like on a tablet. I think that this is something that could be fixed through updates, but it's a problem I saw on several apps.  Definitely worth the money.
It is what you get for such a low price. I like it so far.  Very lite weight & great for travel, Haven't had any issues so far. I use it mainly for checking Email, I haven't uploaded windows 10 yet.
Great Laptop at a great price.  Bought this laptop for my daughter for her art school and she loves it. I bought the 8gb ram upgrade and the laptop has no issues running illustrator, Photoshop and other art design programs.
very fast, hard to find these specs for less.  Seems well built, well laid out, and gobs of battery life.
Great product!
The laptop is great and very quick!
Awesome computer for the money
Great little computer  Great little computer.  Fast, light, easy to read with 70 year old vision.  Longer battery life than my tablet.
By by laptop - hello sketching, e-drawings, notes and report writing  I just clicked the buy button for a "Samsung Series 7 XE700T1A-A05US 11.6-Inch Slate (64 GB, Win 7 Pro)" I am a Design Engineer who often spends time in the field evaluating machinery and systems. I put away the laptop several years ago as the battery life was dismal and it just wasn't as portable as my needs required. Up till now I get by with my I-phone but it's tough to really do a decent email.  Before that expensive mouse click, I spent over 10 hours over several days reading professional & personal reviews, blogs and anything I could find on a windows 7 tablet (or slate). I was caught between this and the ASUS offering but after extensive reading, found that there are several niceties you get with the Samsung. . . The rear camera, 128 Gig SSD (VS 64 on the ASUS)Win 7 Pro (VS Win 7 Home on the Asus)and somewhere I read that the processor on the Samsung is faster (not certain about that). As the device won't arrive for a few days, I can't say if I made the right choice yet but here is a list of what I am envisioning. . .  Capable of running Solidworks E-Drawings to review Solidworks models and assemblies. I wish it could run Solidworks but I think that's asking too much. Running all Office programs, power point, word, notes, outlook, Excel, etc. AutoCAD as well. Good handwriting recognition so I can take notes and mark up drawings and photos. Camera on the screen side so I can say hello to my wife while I'm on the road. And a camera on the back so I can take some shots of machines in action and then add notes using the stylus.  With all this ability (if all I have read is true), making my trip reports should be a lot easier.  I'll let you know within a few weeks as I have a road trip coming up. I gave it five stars to begin with - we'll see if I take any off over time.  JW  . . .. . .To continue - The slate showed up in three days as promised. I bought the dock somewhere else and saved 30 bucks or so. I have installed SolidWorks 11 and it opens and lets me edit single parts easily. I haven't tried a complex assembly yet but I'm not expecting much as the video is probably going to tank a bit. As I oversee machine design for our Engineering Department yet often have to be on the road, I'll be able to review designs using E-Drawings which I have tried, and it runs extremely well - even for complex assemblies. Handwriting recognition using the stylus is amazing. I went through a bit of the "teach" program that helps the software learn your style of writing but I didn't go through every lesson. It seems to learn as I write though (and edit mistakes). The glass gets fingerprints on it but its a piece of glass for crimeny sake. Besides, the prints aren't noticeable looking straight at the screen. I removed some of the gadgets as I'm not a Facebook or twitter fan and I use Outlook for my calendar and to-do lists. The computer has a clock so I removed that additional gadget as well. Battery life is fine at around five + hours. I have the screen brightness set around 30% which works fine for me. Currently Installed Programs; Solidworks Pro, Microsoft Office (all of it), E-Drawings, Autodesk Sketchbook Pro (awesome with the pressure sensitive pen).  A  few points against Samsung - the tiny piece of plastic that covers the single USB port is silly. The first time I removed it (which wasn't easy), it popped out and flew about five feet. I found it, but ended up putting it in a safe place in my dresser drawer. This should have been a rubber cover with a tang to keep it attached. Having the port open shouldn't be an issue as the base station port has no cover and is probably more delicate. It may have been a better decision to not even have a cover if it's not going to be usable. The other negative is no pen storage. While I probably won't loose it, it a second thing to grab when I'm headed out and having it slip into the side (like the ASUS) would have been sweet. I bought the case logic cover and while it seems made for the slate, it has no place to store the stylus either. I already had a mini HP keyboard that uses a tiny USB dongle and it works awesome. My fingers are too fat to use the onscreen keyboards for anything other than a few keystrokes - like entering passwords. There is also an additional on-screen keyboard program called "Swipe" but I didn't get along with it at all and removed the program entirely. Overall, I am very happy with this portable touch computer/digitizer and would buy it again.  JW
Perfect Laptop  This Laptop is Perfect. We love it and would order again. 5++
Extremely Happy with this Chromebook! (Except for keyboard)  Although I am a heavy user of Android and Google services, I waited a long time before buying a Chromebook. The concept intrigued me since they were originally released, but I wasn't sure that a Chromebook would be enough to fit my needs.  After a lot of research that included reading many reviews, I finally jumped in and got one.  I could not be more pleased! This particular model is a great value, and for web browsing and email reading, it is perfect. The battery life is really good (over 6 hours depending on usage), and it is really light!  This is not a regular Windows computer, so you should be sure that you understand that before buying it so that you aren't disappointed. But for general Internet, email, Youtube, Facebook, etc, this is a great device. And with the Google offline apps, it can be used for word processing, taking notes, and other functions.  My only complaint is that the keyboard has those flat keys that look like chicklets, which makes it more difficult to type because you can barely feel where one key ends and the next begins. Plus, the keys don't feel very durable. However, most of the use I plan on giving it involves web browsing with limited typing, so it shouldn't be a problem. But if you are a blogger or plan on typing a book on this, make sure you try the keyboard at a store before you buy...
Powerful gaming and entertainment laptop, but big  This is a powerpacked laptop that is very well designed for entertainment and gaming.  It's bulky enough that it's really best as a desktop substitute, but that's perfect for our family.  What we liked:  - This has great performance.  Between the processor and the onboard solid state drive, this is easily the fastest home computer I've ever seen.  It boots up almost instantly, and launches Microsoft Office in a few seconds or less.  I haven't come up with any program yet that shows any noticeable lag whatsoever.  - The screen in huge and beautiful, and looks good from angles, and the speakers are very good.  You can easily watch movies or play games on this thing without extra speakers or screens, although of course it works with all of those.  - It's sleek and good looking, with a case of testured black material and a red backlit keyboard.  The look is a little stark, and I might turn off the keyboard lighting in a business environment, but at hime, I like it fine.  (I'd probably slightly prefer a less harsh lighting color, like a softer blue or green, but itt's still good).  A couple warnings:  - There's no touchscreen.  At first, I didn't think I'd mind, but Windows 8 is really designed with touch screens in mind.  I don't think it's a dealbreaker personally, but if you're used to a touchscreen, well, this doesn't have one.  I didn't find the trackpad any worse than other trackpads I've used, but I added a mouse anyway, and am a lot happier with it.  - It's not very portable.  Between the giant screen, the hard drive and SSD, the optical drive, and the array of ports, this is large and heavy.  That makes it great for a desktop that you occasionally move to another room, but I wouldn't recommend this for someone who plans to travel a lot with the laptop - those extra ounces add up.  All in all, though, if you're looking for a home or office laptop with solid gaming, entertainment, or app performance, I'd gladly recommend this one
I'm very happy with the performance  This laptop is fast and a pleasure to use, with Windows 8.1.  I'm very happy with the performance, and the keyboard design is great.  The battery life is longer than my old laptop, which is a relief.  All around good service with this pc.
Great buy thank you
Really really good deal  Out of the box and running within 1 hour, wife is technology challenged but everything was well laid out. I would recommend to anyone looking for a good value in a notebook
Works great.  Kid loves it!! Works great.
Great device  This is a great device, I have the Snow White 32GB SSD/4GB RAM/Lifetime 4G model, and I run it in dev mode with Crouton and Ubuntu Trusty.  Pros: It's very low maintenance for a Linux laptop, with really easy to use WiFi and HSPA+ setup, and solid media playback. The ChromeOS part takes care of all the bits of mobile Linux that are usually annoying while Crouton takes care of the rest. Steam and light weight games like Fez work fine. Also, with Steam In-Home streaming I can play Windows games on a light and long battery life laptop (in my house only, but that's fine for me). Battery life is phenomenal.  Cons: Screen resolution is a bit on the low side. The plastic discolors around the edges.
great product
This is a great machine - perfect for my daughter entering high school - pretty cool looking too
Powerhouse  This is a wonderful laptop. It's thin and light but feels extremely solid. The retina screen is absolutely gorgeous to look at. The only down side to retina is that many websites don't have high enough resolution images so they end up looking a little blurry. I just hope those sites increase their image resolutions because the retina display is truly amazing... it makes all my photos look a lot better :)  The machine is very fast with most apps opening instantly. Even heavy weight ones like XCode. The battery life is very good; I haven't really gotten to test if it gets the advertised 9 hours though.  The built in SD card reader is handy. The only thing I miss is an ethernet connection (you can get a thunderbolt to ethernet adapter). I rarely need it but there have been times.  All the stuff I've come to love with Apple in a convenient package. The free copy of Numbers, Pages and keynote are nice too. I highly recommend.
I love it!  My daughter "borrowed" my red gateway netbook when her HP laptop broke.  I have an ipad, but still like having a pc.  This is great.
the best laptop from Acer  This laptop's so powerful, you can play lots of games using this one. the best laptop from Acer! thanks for this great product!
Awesome specs for a laptop, great price.  Ordered this computer because I wanted something that can play some decent games on medium settings. It has only arrived yesterday, but I am already in love with it. It feels solid, well built and has insane computing power for a laptop of its price. The Dedicated video card is a huge plus. The GT 720m is a newer card and it shows. You can easily play TF2, Runescape, LoL, Torchlight 2, Diablo 3 and many other "lower end" games on max settings. Then we get to the heavy hitters, like Crysis, BF3 and Skyrim. It handles Skyrim on medium at 35 FPS, BF3 on low at 25-40 and Crysis... well lets just say you can barely play it on low. That's no big deal for me because I have a custom built desktop that can easily handle such games, but for others it might be a concern.  The only con I have is Windows 8, It is AWFUL. I'll be torrenting Win 9 as soon as it is released.
GREAT PRICE- I NOW HAVE 2 ASUS UX 31 Zenbooks. Love them. VERRY VERRY THIN and Lightweight.
Excellent design! Excellent performance!
Peculiar  Let me tell you one thing first. Incredible! When you open the box of this laptop and you discover how beautiful and sophisticated is, you realize that you have in your hands something peculiar. You may think that this machine is from another planet. We'll maybe the people who created it may be. Later on you'll discover how advanced and futuristic is. It's more than a privilege to have this laptop PC, because is able to do a lot tasks smoothly and is able to play every game on higher settings without warming.  I don't know why some people have been having trouble with this laptop. Maybe the cause of the problems is the time of delivering because of the distances of the destination countries and the bad logistic services of them. This is the deal. A great investment for your needs in this globalized and demanding World. Thank you
I like this for emailing and web browsing. Convenient.
Excellent laptop. It met all my expectations. It is very slim and the building material is very good.
works  great,  love  Windows 7  We bought this for our daughter to use at college about 3  months  ago,  and it works great.  Only downside was lack of MS Office,  but for the price I really can't complain.  Really  happy it has  Windows 7  instead  of Windows 8.
It has a very nice screen and picture quality  I bought this as a replacement after my son dropped his other chromebook too many times.  I am thrilled with this!  It has a very nice screen and picture quality.  Runs fast and I love that we can download items onto it unlike the chromebook he had before.  I would definitely recommend this product and consider it a great deal.
Excellent
it does the job  I have thrown a lot of stress on this computer on line games on steam , streaming with Netflix and youtube I have cable connection and this computer FLYS ..so far it has out performed, my Dell and HP great computer for a lower price ..easily rate this a 5
It's very nice, liked the price.
Great value  Fantastic value. Very quick boot and performance. Perfect for taking notes in college and connecting to the Internet between classes.
Trying A Mac  Need a lightweight laptop so tried this one because of less trouble with spam and viruses. So far it seems to work out for me. Some things I like better about windows but no big issues.
Very good laptop for basic stuff. Excellent value for the money.  Light but solid, responsive, pretty good keyboard, impressive battery life.  Do you want to surf the web, do your email, watch internet videos, write the Great American Novel, video chat, teach yourself how to create web pages, AND not worry about destroying a $1,000+ piece of electronic equipment with a 7-11 Big Gulp?  I think you may be hard pressed to get more bang for your buck than this gadget right here.
I love this high speed dell laptop  I love this high speed dell laptop. It's very fast for gaming and also a good choice to do research computation and presentation. Highly recommend! Five stars!
Very user friendly  I have never bought a ASUS before but I really love how easy to use this computer is.  I am not really that into technology so personally I need something user friendly and this works perfect for me !
LOVE it!  Got this factory refurbished at Best Buy for $499, (could get for about same price here, but wanted to have their 14 day "touchy feely" period to try it out at home and see if I liked it.  I've been researching laptops for awhile, Amazon is always helpful for customer reviews, and I found Cnet.com and PCmagazine.com the best for expert reviews.  But no matter how much research that you do, you will always find people who absolutely love each model, (or brand) or hate it.  Other reviewers of this computer on other sites absolutely raved about both it and the HP brand ... many said that they only would purchase HP's because they had bad experiences when they tried another brand.  But I think a lot of it comes down to individual expectation, experience, and preferences.  Personally, I love this laptop.  The 14" screen is a perfect size for having it on my lap while curled up on the couch, and it's thin/small size makes it easy to carry along with me. I love how light it is, (around 4.4 pounds?) some of the others I was looking at were right at 5 pounds, and you wouldn't think that would make much of a difference, but each time I pick it up I'm amazed by how light it is.  It made with sturdy design - no cheap plastic here.  I really like the media keys up top, (volume) ... on my husband's brand new Samsung i7 laptop he has to use 2 hands to push the function key along with media key, while I can just hit media key alone.  Little things, but I like it.  I like the mouse pad as well, just enough sensitivity for me, (unlike my husband's Samsung, which isn't sensitive enough - but that is one of those personal preferences that will be different for everyone.  I am currently unemployed, so the computer is running 15 straight all day, every day, and I find that it runs very cool and quiet ... very different than my previous dell laptop which ran very hot and loud. I really wanted the WiDi technology so that I could watch the free hulu tv shows on my hdtv instead of my computer without needing cables, (this looks so awesome, by the way!)  You'd be hard pressed to find another Intel i5 Core Processor for under $500.  The only thing I wish it had was a backlit keyboard.  But the pro's of this awesome laptop far outways the cons.  I'm so happy that I bought it!!  Added note on 1/23/12:  I wanted to come back and add to this review now that I've had a few more months to "play" with my new laptop.  I'm still thrilled with it - I'd increase my review to 6 stars if I had the option.  It continues to runs cool and silent, no matter how long it's been on.  The sound and picture are both great.  It is incredibly light and has a long battery life.  I continue to love the stand alone media keys.  I also like that they have a "HP support" link right on the computer, where I have the option of having an online chat with a real person at HP anytime, and if I'm having a specific technical issue with my computer, I can give my pc permission to transfer data to a HP support technician so they can help me resolve my issue.  I haven't had to use this feature yet, and hope I never will, but it's nice knowing it's there.  The only thing it's missing is backlit keys.  Other than that, for my needs it's perfect!  I absolutely love it!
Worth every  dime, and then some!  I just want to give a special thank you for providing a super affordable/cheap laptop for those who do not have the money to spare. Thank you, and God bless. I will be buy another if I can  scrap the money together!
Apple MacBook Pro 13.3 Inch Laptop  Purchased for our son as a Christmas gift. Perfect size.  Set up was a breeze. This will be my next computer!!
like Netflix but for the price its great  Had a few scratches and one dent , it is a older laptop so a few sites won't work , like Netflix  but for the price its great , works fine , does what needs to be done but glitches sometimes.
Great Laptop. No DVD Drive.  These are a great buy. Keep in mind that they don't included a DVD Drive. Not worth deducting any stars.
A great toll in every way.  A great tool in every way, a good size and excellent durability of the battery.  4G connection is great, works as HSPA + in Iceland
Yes it sure did
Best value for $600 price category notebook  Work as expected. A few things to note: 1. do not update the graphic driver from Intel.com. Use the one from Asus.com. The one from Intel did not work with sleep mode :-( 2. Get a case. The surface is rather slippery. 3. No wired network. But you can buy a USB version. 4. It didn't come with any dongle for display.  1+ month already. Very happy with the purchase. Thank you Asus.
it is great.  This was for a friend.  it is great.
GOOOOOOOO:D !!!
The Chromebook is totally AWESOME!  This is GREAT.  I read the Amazon reviews and I'm delighted to say that it is exactly as was described.  It's a GREAT tool to use for internet browsing, emails, and Word and PDF docs, as well.  It's fast-  super easy to use and I even recommended it on my FB page- The case Pwr+ Sleeve Case Cover Bag for Samsung Series 5 Chromebook 3g / Wi-fi ;...is perfect for it, too.
So far so good  This is a very nice machine with a solid build feel, beautiful screen, and (thus far) fast processing. I have yet to really tax the system, but I've had multiple system-taxing programs running at once with nary a slow-down. The integrated graphics are set as the default, and they are pretty underwhelming. But it is fairly easy to switch over the default to the NVIDIA graphics. Since I've done that, the graphics are great and the system runs smoothly with the updated graphics. I'm excited to see how it handles some really serious graphics and processing loads, but so far it's handled everything I've thrown at it like a champ.
Excellent laptop. My son's school asked the kids to buy chromebooks. He loves his laptop, its touch screen. It has worked great so far (2 months).
i love it
great  its great, better than I expected.    jfisherman ---- bronx, n.y.
Thank you
As Advertized ------****  As advertized,it is a very nice laptop. Turns on & shuts down just in few seconds,after pressing power button. I have been using it for last 3 mnths. No issues so far. Only thing I found annoying,only at times though,that display driver stops & then immediately recovers. But,screen freezes & need to close the lid & then it works. May be I need to look in to display driver update !! Laptop doesn't get hot like my hard drive laptop. Battery works for a long time. I think 256 GB shoud be the minimum SSD for this amazing laptop,specially as the price of SSD is constantly dropping. Again this laptop is worth your  money.
Excellent  Excellent,  everything OK, very fast
Gokd product 299 is good price
Monster Laptop  this precious piece is monster. I bought it for my architect sis and she is so happy with its performance, the design is elegant which makes your usage experience more fun.
works very well
I have had this computer for a year now, and it does everything I need it to.  The battery life is very good, although I did have to replace it after the first year.  It does a good job with videos and internet browsing.  I'm not a big gamer, but I have played Starcraft II on it and it ran it pretty smoothly.  Anyway, it's a great machine for the price.
Very Satisfied User  My wife is the user and she likes its looks, speed, ample memory and disk storage. No complaints from her.
Completely worth it!!  Amazing!! Ordered it 3 days ago and it arrived early. Quick as heck. Totally worth the money
Got this for my sister in law. She loves it. Performs well for a laptop that looks good and is compact [she prefers smaller] especially for the price. Beats netbooks and chromebooks in versatility IMO. I bought the 13 inch for nearly the same price for another family member, which I personally think is a better deal, but like I said some people will want the smaller form factor. Highly recommend
Asus X552E delivered all that I wanted and more  I was looking for a laptop that was both fast and affordable. Asus met both of those needs. The screen is extremely clear and the speakers work great. I often have as many as 10 screens open at a time and the computer still works fine. I don't usually use the webcam but did just to try it out and was told that the picture came out great. It looked good from my end also. My son listened to music while playing a game and said that he did not encounter any problems. If you are looking for a good laptop with lots of memory and good features for less than $500.00, then this is your best bet.
yasss it's amazeballs
Love this laptop. Worth every cent and then some.
Perfect for my use  I'm using this laptop as an on-stage soft synth host (I'm a keyboard player). The criteria I needed to hit:  1) Powerful CPU to run multiple plug-ins 2) Backlit keyboard so I can see things in the dark 3) A battery in case the power goes out for some reason 4) Enough RAM (8GB), with the potential to go 16GB if I need it for some reason. 5) Enough disk (500GB+) that's fast enough for my purposes. This model has a 750GB drive. 6) A screen with enough pixels 7) USB 2 for connecting adapters, MIDI, etc. 8) Ability to boot from an external drive in case the one onboard stops working for some reason  9) All at a reasonable price point  Nice to have was a DVD drive, which this model has, so I can read CDs/DVDs or burn them.  What I didn't need -  1) Bluetooth 2) 1920x1080 display 3) Ultra light weight 4) Touch screen 5) SSD 6) Discrete graphics card  Basically, lots of horsepower and no luxuries, which this laptop delivers in spades. Note that this is a VERY different requirement than for a gamer, student, etc. I actually prefer bigger pixels with lower resolution so that I can see the software running more easily.  Quad core / hyperthreaded CPU is at the top end and equivalent to high end desktops of a year or so ago. So far the i7-4700MQ has been great.  BTW, another handy feature is the ability to hit F12 to put it in airplane mode - DPC latency can cause audio pops and clicks, usually with WiFi drivers in Windows 8. F12 immediately turns off wireless, and DPC Monitor comes up as being suitable for streaming audio.  There were a few of the usual bloatware programs which I removed. I clone my HD periodically so I don't have to worry about incremental backups, etc.  Build quality is sufficient, although not up to the top-end standards, but I'm not planning to bang it around. I'm running Start8 so don't care about the new dashboard, and given onstage use the noise of the fans is irrelevant (and they're not noisy in my opinion). Even when running Prime95 to see how 100% CPU load copes it was in line with any other system I've used.  For the price I paid on Amazon this was a steal, and hopefully should give me at least several years of use.
This is my first apple macbook. works really good and I would like to recommend it to everybody that I know of. it is light and feels very tough.i like the keyboard and the screen.
I like it but husband wanted a smaller on.  Bought another Asus
Solid computer that runs well.  I'm very happy with this computer. It's good looking, solid and it runs well. I wouldn't call it a speed demon but it's not what I would call slow.  I run this computer fairly hard doing database work and the case stays really cool. This computer is basically a desktop replacement for me. It's plugged into a large 1080p monitor. The two monitor setup works really well for me. I travel quite a bit with this thing and it's fairly lightweight and easy to pack.  The only thing I don't like is the 1366x768 resolution -- I wish that was a little more dense. However, in this price range there's not anything with a higher resolution out there to be had.  I like this computer. It works well for me and I would recommend it to others, based on their needs.
... (C720) and she loves it as much as I love mine. These are really good  I bought this for my daughter after buying one for myself the previous year (C720) and she loves it as much as I love mine. These are really good. I only wish it had CD drive but for the price it's really worth it.
For the price this is really a nice laptop. I play ESO on it all the time.
good computer. good price. After many months, it is still functioning perfectly. No complain.
Best value ever!  Everything was great, it arrived quickly and the price wqas unbeatable! It was a gift and my son was also thrilled! Thanks
I have had this for 3 years now and it still works great! I would suggest replacing the hard drive with a solid state drive though.
Really nice, remarkable value  You really couldn't ask for more for less. Great little machine. Incredibly lightweight, but seems sturdy enough. Good display, great touchpad. Incredible value. If all you want is quick and easy internet access, I recommend this highly.
Very nice laptop for the price  Very nice laptop for the price. Very good performance and respectable battery life. Not for games of course but for everything else this machine is amazing. Install an SSD onto this machine and you get a laptop that rivals a desktop in speed.  I installed an SSD onto this machine and it absolutely flies. Runs very nicely with Linux Mint as long as you use an updated linux kernel that has the drivers for this laptop. Battery life is very respectable usually lasting 4-6 hours. The screen is a matte screen and it's surprisingly nice. I honestly expected a terrible TN display but I was pleasantly surprised. Good build quality for the price  Cons: No removable hard drive cover No removable battery Viewing angles could be better  That's right you have to open up the laptop completely to get to the battery and hard drive. Wasn't a big deal for me but I can see this being an issue for some. The keyboard is a bit flimsy but I can't really complain for the price, there has to be some drawbacks here. Also no touchscreen in case you didn't already know  All in all I'm very happy with my purchase.
Good laptop. Seller delivered ontime. .
Simply...AWESOME  After 10+ years of using Windows, I have one suggestion for everybody - GO MAC!!! You'll never go back!! Mac just works. Instant start-up. No spinning wheels, no waiting, no constant updates. This MBPro is awesome. Sure, I could have gotten a super high-end PC for this kind of money, but I guarantee you I'd be ready to give it away in 1-2 years. The Mac is an INVESTMENT not an instantly depreciated doorstop! Well worth the money!!!
Why I Bought The 2015 Macbook Pro Retina 13" instead of the 2016 MacBook Pro 13" Base Model in 2017!!!!  It's 2017, right? Times are a-changin', right? No one needs those silly outdated things like USB-A ports, HDMI, and SD Card slots built into their laptops anymore with USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 Protocols being established in the tech industry, right?  NO APPLE! JUST, NO!! WRONG WRONG WRONG. ESPECIALLY FOR A PRODUCT YOU LABEL "PRO"!!  Being a PRO product in the laptop industry indicates that it is built in the interest of people such as myself who want to render video files, transfer photo albums, and more using their SD cards, hard drives both new and old, and so forth. Nixing the USB-A ports is something I can KIND OF forgive Apple for, given that USB-C is going to replace everything it is able to replace here given a half a decade, but the SD CARD SLOT! THE SD CARD SLOT!!!!!! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE APPLE!!! WHY???? OH MY GAWD WHY!!!!!  Pardon my toddler temper tantrum, but I just had to release that pint up anger I have been distilling in the deepest catacombs of my patience for months and months.  This review is going to be long and is intended to be as much a praise filled review for the 2015 MacBook Pro I purchased recently as it is an admonishment of the 2016 MacBook Pro.  I am a nursing student and an up-and-coming YouTube reviewer and I decided it was time to buy something I could take to school with me every single day and do video editing work on that would be streamlined with my other Apple products. I live on the go. I eat fast food products (probably more than a nursing student should), sleep very little, do homework and study from the open of some coffee shops until they close, and write reviews and work on videos way more than I probably should given that I am supposed to be learning how to save peoples' lives and stuff.  Thus, I set out with a $1300 dollar flexible budget to find the right Apple computer for me since I am already up to my eyeballs with joy over my 2017 Alienware 17 R4 PC back home and wanted to go in the direction of my other Apple products (call me a sheep for Apple if you want, but I think this review will prove that I am willing to call Apple on their bull and if you don't like Apple products than you should just go away, you are DEFINITELY reading the wrong review, bub ;).  After doing lots of research, the 2016 MacBook Pro 13" base model seemed like a great choice for me. It sports a long 10-hour battery (so they say), is---patience of a 18th century Catholic school teacher---thin, and has all the latest and greatest Apple goodies built-in save for the touch bar (an entertaining addition at best, downright annoying at worst---many reviewers say). Alas, there were too many compromises made for Apple to make such unapparent dimensional and functional abilities manifest.  The biggest for me that is not negotiable is that they executed the SD card slot!!!  At least with the USB, HDMI, and MiniDisplay ports, we can huddle in a corner with our precious dongles and whisper into the empty night, "My... precioussssss..." and assure ourselves that someday we will be able to transition all of those items into actual USB-C replacement products.  But Apple-- stinking, rotting, and losing its nutritional value Apple---decided that it was time to say, "Off with their heads!" like The Red Queen (and with as much sanity) to all of the poor, begging-for-mercy SD card slots in the MacBook Pro lineup; forcing usuntil death or sale or accident do we part---- to have to use an external adapter of some sort to read our SD cards. That. Was. So. Stupid. Of. Them.  I feel completely confident in making up the statistic that 99.9% of all professional and semi-pro photographers use SD cards in their cameras or other equipment. The SD card is in no way obsolete, nor has current wireless technology replaced the intrinsic value of physical storage and transfer methods being hardwired into devices. I do not CARE that there are SD card readers that are USB-C compatible. When I am on the go doing film work or working on reviews, I do not want to have to worry about carting around 50 dongles!! Some smart reader might be thinking right now, "Well wait Bren, you said you have the 2017 Alienware 17 R4 and it doesn't have an SD card slot, why aren't you sad about that?". Because that PC is a 10 pound desktop replacement gaming laptop and it can gladly stay at home as it can afford to utilize a SD card reader as I already have 500 cables and adapters running from it in its usual dusty waiting spot (nursing student, remember? Its been a while since I have gamed :'( ). This summer when I use the Alienware laptop more, I might get occasionally annoyed that it does not have an SD card slot, but then I will more than likely remember that I have a Mac and switch to working on it anyways (oooooohhh, he said it Mac haters... 0.0). Even for the comparably Mac sized 2017 Razer Blade 14, I am disappointed but somewhat willing to forgive it of its lack of SD card slot as its primary purpose will be gaming for most buyers.  But the MacBook Pro is a different story. It is a small, light, powerful device that until 2016 seemed custom fit for content creators, photographers, and other such lines of work or hobbies.  Imagine this scenario because something like it WILL happen someday if you get the newest MacBook Pro: You are on a multi-day vacation or out for an all-day photoshoot having the time of your life. You sit down at some point to get some albums created and pics and videos uploaded from your camera when, "Oh NO!! SHOOT!!!. You have lost, forgotten, or had stolen your precious SD card reader! Now you are out of luck and that's all she wrote. Comment and tell me your solutions to this SD card reader dongleitis (not a real medical diagnosis, I am quoting MobileTechReviews' Lisa, there), but I will reply to every solution with, "But wouldn't it be better if it was just built in?".  The vacation/school/work trip scenario applies to any other dongles you might, no will--have to use until your hand is forced by the market to replace every legacy port item in your arsenal.  I saved $300.00 and bought this 2015 MacBook Pro Retina 13" on sale and I absolutely love it. Any gain in weight and thickness between this and its younger sibling are pretty much negligible to me. When you are on your next flight and your carry on is a half-pound over or slightly too thick, you are not going to say to yourself, "Aw shucks, I should have gone with the 2016 MacBook Pro!! What was I thinking?!". You are going to say, "Well, I guess grandma's Christmas jammies she knitted me last year could have gone in my checked suitcase on this leg of the trip!"  10 hours versus 9 on the 2015. An hour gain in battery life: For who? Doing what? When? Where? I get it, I really do. I spent 4 months trying to find a gaming laptop that could give me just 30 minutes more battery life in a coffee shop typing if I needed it and boost the battery life from 2 to 2-12 hours. But 9 hours versus 10? I really hope to our Lord in Heaven Above that you are never stuck glued to a chair in a wall outlet-less dessert of a room for that long. Or that you can't manage to turn south your upturned nose and just dim the light down or postpone that video transfer for an hour or if absolutely necessary.  Better yet, the solution to the battery life drama resides in the hands of a company originating on Indiegogo called Omnicharge.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Omnicharge-Omni-20-A-Portable-Power-Bank-Charger-for-Laptops-Cameras-Phones-Smart-devices-and-More-AC-HVDC-Power-Outlet-Fast-Charging-USB-Ports-70W-Adjustable-DC-Output-20-400mAh/dp/B01NBJX99D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Omnicharge | Omni 20 | A Portable Power Bank Charger for Laptops, Cameras, Phones, Smart devices and More | AC/HVDC Power Outlet | Fast-Charging USB Ports | 70W Adjustable DC Output | 20,400mAh</a>&nbsp;I included pictures that show my beautiful 2015 MacBook Pro and the Omnicharge Omni 20 I just got recently. The Omni 20 is a portable power bank and the first of its kind that can charge this MacBook via the Mac charger hooked into the Omni 20s AC wall outlet port and with direct DC Output via a custom made Magsafe 2 cable the company sends you when you choose it during order as shown in one of the pictures!! I am not sponsored or compensated in any way for saying this, I was an early backer of the Omnicharge on Indiegogo and it has more than exceeded my expectations when I finally got it last week. It won tech of the year at CES 2017 and I will not be surprised when it appears on every major retail website including Best Buy, Newegg, and others, it is already available for purchase in the U.S on Amazon. It is expensive, but it is absolutely, positively worth it. If you buy this Macbook Pro on sale like I did, you can take the $300.00 you saved and buy an Omnicharge to get essentially 14 hours of battery life with your Mac!, buzz off 2016 MacBook Pro!!  Check out my full-length review of it in the comments, I know you are going to want to consider it yourself as soon as you skip around in the table of contents I made for the video and see everything it can do, just note that at the time I filmed this I still had my 2015 MacBook Air. New Videos will be coming featuring my lovely MacBook pro!! I am going to link the Amazon page for it, I am not sure where it'll pop up in the review, so I hope it doesn't seem scammy! :D  Overall, the point of all this drama is just to say that any stated gains in whatever whatevers the 2016 MacBook Pro 13" base model is trying to shove off on you just are not worth the sacrifices involved nor the snooty price premium you will pay for the latest-yet-not-greatest from Apple.  This entire review was written at 3am in the dark on my lovely, perfect, streamlined, truly and honestly PRO MacBook product. The 2015 MacBook Pro Retina 13" base model from Apple.  If you have made it this far in the review, then that means that this device has that much interest to you. Or I am just that good of a writer. Just buy it already for crying out loud!!!!!  If this review made you laugh or helped you in any other way, please hit like so others can see it! Cheers!  -TechRN
great has small mark on top but this computer works great
All the features are as add says and its performance is great for business and university  This is an amaizing laptop. All the features are as add says and its performance is great for business and university. Any damage and it is totally new.
great
NICE!!!  I've had this laptop for about a week. This is a great working laptop.  The screen is brilliant and sturdy (no wobble), the touch screen is very responsive, the keyboard is nice (doesn't feel week or cheap).  It's very fast.  Boots up in well under 1 minute.  Wifi seems very strong and fast.  The only thing I have noticed, but not often, is the track pad can be less than sensitive at times.  All in all -- very happy so far.
Pretty slim, good price  Very impressed so far. Pretty slim, good price, runs fast, and love the specs. Perfect college laptop for me - engineering student that requires a powerful workhorse.
Love It!
love my laptop  we bought this for $104.00 money well spent im writin g this review using it its a great little lap top light weight and dioes everything it says it does
Excelent product!
Absolutely everything I'd ever want/need in a laptop.  The only downside is that it tends to get a bit hot - but hey... it's doing a lot of work, this laptop is incredible!!
Thanks amazon this was great product. I am happy with this company I use this company from years and this was one on the best products.
As expected!
Very pleased with the features  Purchased for my daughter. Very pleased with the features, quality and price.
The PERFECT Laptop  Love this little guy...not too small as to be difficult to manage, small enough to have 5+ hours of battery life and be totally portable--able to fit into any bag I choose.  Bought to replace one of the exact same model I've had for years without a hitch until the keyboard suddenly became unresponsive.  Still want my comp whiz son to try to bring the little dude back to life...I heart 'im!
Great Buy!
Amazing  Amazing machine.  Looks like I won't be needing a new computer until 2040.
Device came with everything expected.  The battery was not holding a charge, and when I notified the seller they responded quickly and appropriately!!  Much appreciated!!
Excellent  As it was my first time to buy a laptop via internet, I was little nervous. But there was no problem at all. This new laptop is working very well and I am so satisfied.
A good basic laptop  The Acer Aspire E1-531-2438 laptop I recently purchased has all the speed and memory I need for my personal and business needs.  It replaced a HP laptop whose motherboard broke after 4 years.  The bought this because of the good reviews, price and Windows 7.  The Acer Aspire boots up fast which is another plus.  You like I may have to adjust to their keyboard layout which is a little different than most. I only use a computer for email, some layout design work for my business, and research and fun on the Internet.  So far so good.  I would highly recommend this model for anyone who needs and inexpensive yet very well put together laptop.
Great machine for the price  Great machine for the price, Fast, well made, even has a manual on line that tells you important stuff like how to turn on (or off) the keyboard back light.
Love it. Worth every penny  Its an amazing laptop! Love it to death. Great specs! Bought it for 4k video editing but gtx 950s  gpus do not do that. 960s and up do tho. Other than that for gaming and 1080p video should work just fine

Exactly as described. Fast, quiet light and sleek. I was between the Dell XPS13 and the Asus Zenbook UX305, but this one takes the cake because it had a regular sized HDMI port and USB-C. These are the ports that I need that the others do not.
great value on a great machine.  Excellent value on this device!  It is a slightly older model which I had assumed but it was new in the box and it performs very well on all of the games I play!
Great Laptop, good price.
Very good all arond laptop  This is my first Amazon review. Let me say that i've owned quite a few laptops this far and i'm a stundent of Computers Engineering in Argentina. I've purchased this laptop and had it shipped to my country by a private courier so you can imagine it took a while to arrive (around 3 weeks) and that's why i won't talk about amazon's shipping speed. Before this laptop i've owned an Acer purchased on Amazon with quite good specs (Core i3 1st gen 380M, 640 GB HDD, 4GB RAM, 14 inches) and i still consider it as a very good laptop for my needs. I wanted for my next laptop to be a bit smaller and lighter, more powerfull and with a better graphics card. This laptop fulfilled every expectation i had. The design is very good (i still have a little bit of issues with typing but that's OK). The overal performance is very good, i've decided to purchase this one because of the RAM, disk space, CPU and graphics card. Until now i haven't tested it fully yet but so far seems to be performing fine. I hope this review to be useful for those who are thinkng about purchasing this laptop i suggest them to give it a try, they won't be dissapointed. When i purchased it there weren't any reviews but fortunately found two recommending it and decided to buy it and don't regret it :)
Hard to imagine finding a better laptop for the money  Hard to imagine finding a better laptop for the money, and this is coming from a guy who has owned nothing but Dell machines his entire academic and professional career. I've finally made the switch and so glad I did... I'm a particularly big fan of the ThinkPad keyboards, but the whole thing is just super-solid in all the meaningful ways. Highly recommend.
Everything fine
Great lil computer  My husband bought this for me so I would give his computer back to him and for my ebaying I do.  It's the perfect size for me since I run around the house a lot with it.  It doesn't have a cd drivce but most items I've needed to download I've found through their sites or copied from the other computer to a usb. One downfall I found was how impossible it is to find a computer case for this size (11.6")-so I just made my own.  Great product, fast and convenient-well worth the money.  :-)
I am in LOVE...with this lap top  I actually got mine from Frys, I was planning on purchasing the 10.1 Toshiba. Due in part to a rude sales rep and an extremely polite sales rep(now that I think about it they might have been playing good rep/bad rep) Anyhoo long story short I ended with my baby. My Acer Ferrari exceeded my expectations. I have been making movies, writing papers, madly surfing the net and buying all the accessories that make my baby even better(red of course) This is by far the best lap top I have ever had. If it could love me back I would divorce my husband. Two little issues are the fairly loud click on the space bar and low volume speakers. When you buy it I suggest getting your external drive, headphones and memory foam carrying case(protect your baby) if you can at the same time. Oh yes and have fun!
I am very pleased with my  Arrived well packaged and beat all my expectations.  I am very pleased with my purchase
Great product!
Good job Samsung  This is my first non-Thinkpad computer since 1996. In the past few years I have been using T and X series. The new Thinkpads are heavy and screen resolution is not any better than other laptops. Particularly X220, which is useless with 768 vertical resolution. I chose this computer over Thinkpad  T420s, HP Envy Spectre  and Sony S 15.4  inch, because:  Pros: 1- It is the lightest and thinnest laptop among 14 and 15 inch laptops. 2- Has matte screen. I don't understand how people work on glossy screens. 3- Is has HDMI, USB3, 8GB RAM, SSD and a solid build. 4- It boots unbelievably fast. My work Thinkpad T420 has SSD hard drive but it takes much longer to boot. 5- It is extremely quiet. Again, the most quiet laptop I have ever seen. 6- Compare its spec. to Mac Book pro and Air to realize how advance this laptop is. It is lighter, has better screen resolution and boots faster.  Cons: 1- Widescreen are not good for professional work. The vertical resolution is too low and you need to scroll up and down. At the same time you have empty margins on the right and left side of your window. But not Samsung's fault. 2- Keyboard is not very comfortable, and you hit the mouse pad every so often. You somehow cannot type fast either. 3- I prefer Thinkpad's Trackpoint. You work faster with Trackpoints. Again, not Samsung's fault. 4- My scale indicates that this computer in 3.8 lbs and not 3.5 lbs mentioned in the specs.  Expect to spend some time installing Windows updates.
All perfect
Great laptop that runs every game I throw at it like a dream.
Good implementation of Google Chrome
A fine piece of work  This chromebook 2 is exactly what I needed! With the price that I paid for it I definitely got way much more bang for my buck! The one feature that I absolutely have to brag about is the Skullcandy speakers! The quality in the speakers is absolutely spectacular! I thought birds were chirping outside but it was the sound on my chromebook you can hear everything. The chromebooks speed is amazing with downloading. And the battery life stays full for a very very long period of time. This is my first chromebook and I absolutely adore it. I definitely would recommend any and everyone to get one. I am highly addicted to my chromebook. Thank you so much I am an overly excited and very happy customer thank you!!
Awesome and Great  I bought this as a replacement for my old Dell XPS M1530. The only change I made was adding a 256GB SSD drive. Now this thing is lightning fast. Dual core with Hyper-threading makes 4 cores. Why pay extra for a quad-core machine? Compared to the M1530 its half as thick, twice as light, and 40X faster. This same laptop on the Dell website was over $1400. So getting it here is definitely the way to go. I never had a laptop with a backlit keyboard so that's a plus. I would recommend this to ANYONE looking for a laptop replacement for their desktop.  My only complaint is that I run Ubuntu and it does not play nice with the Nvidia Optimus card. To resolve this install bumblebee drivers first.
Buy it, you will be pleased.  I got it for my wife per my son's recommendation.  He is a network engineer and knows his stuff.  Computer is extremely fast, efficient, and easy to use.  The only thing buyers may consider is getting a portable CD drive as all software can not be installed over the web.  GET IT, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!
I was searching for a small, portable laptop that I could carry around with me without feeling like I was toting around a small baby. I am in the process of writing a book, and I got so tired of jotting notes down on whatever scrap of paper was around.... And I am overjoyed that I found this little gem! The size is PERFECT, as I can just toss it into my purse and go!  No hassle.  As most reviewers have said, the key pad is tine...but I found that the more I typed with it, the easier it got.....I still make mistakes but I do that anyway!  The area I'm in does not have a solid wireless access point for internet.....but it does indeed work.  Again, I had it in my purse when I went shopping and it connected like a breeze!  I am thoroughly enjoying my thought out purchase!
Excellent machine. Didn't look very used at all  Excellent machine. Didn't look very used at all, and was extremely fast. It's a Dell so quality is not even a question.
Toshiba finally delivers a notebook in the `Goldilocks' zone  Over the past 18 years I've had a total of 10 different notebooks including 2x Macs, 2x Sony Vaios and several Toshibas (not to mention a brief and disastrous flirtation with Dell). Macs are currently excluded from my shortlist due to lack of compatibility with Sage Line 50 accounts software, so to replace my 2-year old TECRA 110 I looked at the current crop of Toshiba notebooks.  Despite being a fast and beefy computer handling loads of software and ideal for office work, the TECRA has two drawbacks: heavy weight and poor battery life away from the mains. It's so big it often doesn't fit the rectangular plastic tray container at airport security, but has to sit lopsided half-in, half-out. So the portability issue was a major consideration when choosing a replacement. The TECRA's battery life was barely 90 minutes away from the mains, which is hardly enough to do any productive work whilst travelling before having to find a mains socket.  The availability of the recent 2nd generation Intel core processor has finally made possible notebooks with the Goldilocks combination of fast data processing (even with high-demand programs) combined with long battery life and relatively lightweight construction. I've had my Portege R830 with its 13.3-inch screen for two months now and it delivers fast and trouble-free computing together with the convenience of lightweight portability and - no exaggeration, I've experienced this on two occasions now - 7-hour battery life of continuous working away from the mains. Amazing.  This R830 has a smart black & chrome design, plain and discrete rather than flashy. It has a real CPU rather than a ULV chip, a 500GB hard drive, integral mike and camera, useful speakers with good volume and tone as well as connecting ports for externals, and plenty of port options:  * standard USB on both sides (more convenient than having ports on only one side) * SDXC card slot * SATA port * HDMI port * DVD drive * a connector for the chunky 5-point x 3-row plug on the end of your printer cable, whatever the technical name for that plug design is  There's also a fingerprint reader for user-security which I can never get to work properly so don't use; it invariably refuses to recognise two or more prints of the same finger, as the same finger.  It boots in about 30 seconds, the fastest I've ever experienced with a laptop. The screen colour res is beautiful, sharp and clear and it does everything instantaneously.  The minus points form a very short list. The fan can be a bit noisy (but hardly a major problem); and the keyboard is less attractively designed than the previous TECRA with gaps between the keys, but works fine even for someone with fairly chunky fingers.  Overall this is very good value for a mid-range machine: you get a lot of processing power and memory combined with genuine lightweight, carry-in-your-hand portability and long battery life.  I have no experience of Toshiba's warranty service with this R830 as it has, thus far, no faults. I did return the previous TECRA once for a screen fault and on that occasion they sent someone to collect it and returned it, repaired, after two days: very efficient and all FOC.
it works great so far  I paid less for this it was refurbished, it works great so far. So far my apple products just work!
Everything else was easy to locate and utilize  I felt a little silly at first when I could not figure out the simple task of turning the laptop on.  There is no obvious power button on the system itself.  The power key is located on the upper right hand side of the keyboard.  Everything else was easy to locate and utilize.  This laptop is equipped with 3 USB 3.0 ports, a mini DisplayPort 1.2 and a HDMI 1.4 port.  An Ethernet jack and a single audio plug are available as well.  Standard features include a DVDRW drive (why no Blu-Ray?), 16GB 1600MHz DDR3L RAM and an Intel Core i7-4710HQ CPU.  The cpu's normal speed is 2.50GHZ with a turbo boost of 3.5GHz.  The 15 size is great for gaming; the only noticeable sacrifice is the smaller keyboard and keys.  I love the full size arrow keys on my laptop and I found the smaller ones harder to use.  I like how the WASD keys are accentuated with transparent edges so that they are more noticeable in the dark.  The red backlighting is nice, but I prefer the white lettering on my current laptop keyboard since its easier to see.  While the illuminated ROG logo on the back of the matte LCD screen will attract gamers, it will deter professionals who like to have dual purpose systems.
This thing is a gaming powerhouse!  The msi 609us dragon edition is absolutely insane, I got mine about a month ago used for around 2,000 and couldn't be happier! It blew passed any other gaming computers i've tried (Alienware m17x, m18x and asus g75vw) This thing is extremely fast. If im just using internet or watching a video everything loads immediately, and when I'm playing very graphic intensive games I get very high FPS (Just to name a few WoW, LoL, diablo III, crysis 3, Dead space 3, bioshock infinite, skyrim, etc.) with incredible quality and no lag! The 680m is very good and it was really cool that MSI had the 4GB version of the 680m as most alienwares have the 2GB! And the ssd loads extremely fast, it also has some awesome features like 1 touch turbo/overclocking and easy fan boost, and tons of features to make your computer fast and more customized to your liking! This actually beats all of my friends desktops in gaming and loading, AND its portable so i think that's pretty cool! It's pretty light for a gaming computer and somewhat slim as well, It also has a pretty nice charge for a gaming laptop (a little over 4 hours) And I love the speakers! They get so loud and really add to the game you're playing. I really have no issues with this laptop its extremely fast, has stunning picture, lots of storage, fast loading speeds, and I thought windows 8 would bother me at first but I got used to it very quickly and it actually became more convenient and easy to use! Also it definitely costs a lot don't get me wrong but I've used alienwares that are even more expensive to reach its specs and I just don't like them as much, although i do kinda like alienware I'm really glad i found this one because It's way faster and better made than the alienwares. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who games a lot or that just uses computers for every day usage but has some money to drop! You won't be disappointed, nice job MSI!
love this computer  I have had this computer for almost a year now and have had no problems with it. I use it for school. Lightweight and easy to carry. Carried it to school everyday when I was pregnant. Works amazing. My dog pulled it off the table onto the floor and it still works. The only complaint is that the right shift key has to be pressed exactly in the middle to work but overall a very good, dependable computer. Great battery life. Love the screen and keys. The best computer I have ever owned.
Up and running... Woo easy does it!  I have a couple of laptops for various applications but this has quickly become my favorite to use. Don't pay any attention to the LEMON review, every company have a few lemons in a line. Shame that one fell in to the hands of such a pointed individual, who probably didn't give the tech reps the time of day to replace or fix the item. Anyway, back to the matters at hand. This is a solid laptop, not to big, not to small and it is as fast as my i7 desktop. I do keep the applications to a minimum but office starts in seconds and I can have 20 tabs running and not bat an eye between pages. With the 4 GB DDR3 RAM it keeps pace with the best of them. The display is crisp and HDMI out works amazing for audio and HD resolution. My only gripe is the 128MB of video memory. When "specing" out laptops, the only two I found was this one and an i3 with 1GB of video memory and 3GB of RAM but no Blu-ray player. The decision was clear to me but I think I'll miss that extra video RAM as time goes on, but at least I have a blu-ray (which will be the standard for programs and everything soon! Over all I give this a 5 star rating because it is exactly what it said it was going to be a great school, work laptop with plenty of storage. The processor has a 6.9 out of 8 in the windows performance rating and over all a 5.3 (only being held down by the graphics memory).
i like it
Very enjoyable!  This computer has been exactly what I hoped for, with a pleasant surprise as to how quiet and relatively cool it runs.  I would strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a dependable computer without spending too much money on it.
Modern look, reliable and plenty of TOSHIBA features!!  I purchased this laptop 2 years ago and have had nothing but success in using it for my home business.  I do have the unit connected to my network for excessive periods of time and it has always stood up to the challenge of my small business operations.  Nice modern PC laptop for multiple lifestyle users... thumbs up Toshiba!
Very Nice  This laptop is magnificent from top to bottom there nothing about him bad nothing at all i recommend it to all my friends and to all people it's super fast the graphics are just wow.
Awesome Laptop for the Price  I hadn't had a Mac Computer other than a IPAD, IPOD touch for a LONG time.  When I saw this product and the price I said I had purchase the laptop.  I love it.  It's so much fun to sit on my couch at night.  I highly recommend a MAC laptop.  This version is wonderful.
Extremely happy with purchase!  If you want a compact and lightweight laptop that doesn't compromise on functionality and still looks great (and doesn't cost an arm and a leg), then this one's for you. I've been carrying around a 15.5" Sony Vaio for the past 2.5 years--don't get me wrong, I love that chunker--but it got pretty beat up, the battery life was absolutely horrible, and I dreaded having to lug it around in my backpack all day for classes (I'm a full-time college student). So I started looking for a replacement. Buying the Toshiba Portege R835-P94 was one of the best choices I've made in purchasing technology. Here's my breakdown of the pros and cons:  Pros. 1. It only weighs 3 pounds! I can do curls with it on my weak arm for ten minutes and not feel a thing. (well, maybe that's exaggerating, but it's ridiculously light!) 2. It's gorgeous. The exterior looks black in low light, but every once in a while I'll catch a glimpse of that "magnesium blue," and it makes me happy. Not to mention the slight texturing on the cover makes it look even better. 3. The thing fits into my purse. It's nice not to have to take my backpack somewhere just because I'm bringing my laptop. 4. Battery life! I haven't actually sat down and timed how long it can last, but I do know I can watch a 2-hour-long movie, an episode of The Office, and work on a paper (all in high brightness and volume) and still have a solid 40% left. I can't even describe how wonderful it is to take it out for the day, use it during classes and in the student center, and not have to take the power cord with me. It's fantastic. 5. The touchpad. My Vaio didn't have multitouch, and it had some funny texturing on the touchpad. But this Toshiba's touchpad is glorious. It's smooth and super convenient, and it doesn't jump at all when you try to move the mouse. 6. Speed. It's very fast--I haven't had any issues whatsoever with trying to download things or access "busy" web pages.  Cons. 1. Smudges and fingerprints. Because the laptop's a darker color, dust and oils show up on the keys and cover a lot easier than they do on a lighter shade. But of course you can clean it off regularly if that bothers you. It's definitely not worth passing up this baby for. 2. Microphone placement. I like to Skype with friends and family, and I was a little annoyed to find out that the microphone is located on the front right corner of the laptop base right next to the SD slot. It's easy to forget it's there and accidentally rub over it with my wrist when I'm multitasking with working on a project and Skyping, because then the noise kills whoever I'm talking to. Not a great idea to put that there. 3. Speakers. They do their job, but I can tell the difference between these speakers and my Vaio's. These just sound kind of hollow, and the quality's not fantastic. But hey, they work.  So, yeah. That's what I have to say about the Toshiba Portege R835-P94. All in all, I think it's a fantastic laptop for the price. I'm very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend this laptop to anyone!
really nice
Excellent machine, few flaws  Pros:  i5 2.3 GHz 6GB DDR3 RAM Decent graphics card 700 GB HDD  Pretty fast computer with tons of storage.  Graphics card could be a bit better but anything with a 1 or 2 GB video memory is going to cost a lot more than $700.  Very slim, aluminium case.  Keys are nice because they are like Mac keys, things cant get stuck under them.  Not backlit but who cares.  Extremely quiet, almost seems like there isn't even a fan in here.  Seems to have awesome battery life so far.  Cons:  Comes with a bit of bloatware, as most new computers do.  I just uninstalled all of it including Norton SS.  Most of that stuff you don't need.  There were a couple cool things I hadn't heard of before though, like the snipping tool- not sure if that's part of win7 or not but i've never seen it before.  Some of the Samsung apps on here aren't half bad either.  Crashed when I installed steam- reinstalled and it seems to work fine now. No driver issues or anything.  Lastly the screen..  No one seems to have posted what the max resolution is- it's 1366 x 768.  The screen itself is small, but it's a nice compromise if you're looking for portability.  When I play games on this, i'm going to HDMI it to my TV- when i take it to school, i won't be hauling around a 200 lb 5' x 4' laptop anymore.  So really, there aren't many cons.  The bloatware can be easily uninstalled, the crash i had was probably just a random stupid issue, and the screen is small- but if it suits your needs for portability, then it's fine.  hope this helps.
Good Laptop  I love Gateway and I love this laptop. Its not very child-friendly though so if you have kids keep it out of their reach, the keys are easy to come off when pried off with little fingers. Other than that, I have had no problems out of this laptop.
BEST BUY EEEVVVEEERRR!!!!!  Oh my gosh! Where do I begin???? If there were ten stars I would give it eleven!!  First of all, I must credit Amazon. Every product that I have bought so far works perfectly. I have gotten an RC truck, RC drone, and now this! In fact, I'm writing this review with this amazing laptop. Also, at least for me, shipping is great. All of my products have come about a day early of when they say. If there was one store on Earth, I would hope it would be Amazon!!  Now, back to the laptop. This machine is very fast. The 4GB RAM lets it loads pages very quickly if you're surfing the internet of if you're doing homework. I've had this for a few months now, and it hasn't failed me once yet! The 500GB storage is helpful for storing a file of any size.  The webcam on this performs exceptionally well, as does the sound system. Gaming works well on this, though I haven't tried very many.  Windows 10 is very easy to get used to. I can navigate it easily, and the laptop boots up in less than a minute, so I can get on it quickly.  When opening it from delivery, you will have to charge it for 3 hours before use. The battery can last up to about 8 hours if you're just surfing the internet. This laptop does not heat up at all and the fan is barely audible. It does have a disc drive, a webcam, and three USB ports (2 third generations and 1 second generation). It comes with a charger and battery, though the battery is hard to remove (I don't see why anyone would want to though). The one and only downside is that the keyboard does not light up for night use.  This laptop is an amazing score for me and I hope to use it for years to come. PLEASE BUY!!!!
Perfect for Linux!  Okay, I can't really comment on Windows performance on this. I imagine Windows 10 will be sufficient. It is, after all, a Celeron processor. that being said, I reimage these with Linux Mint Cinnamon. My customers absolutely LOVE Linux Mint. So much so, that I am receiving referrals requesting it. Mint works very well on this laptop! It is fast, secure, stable, and outperforms Windows in every measure. The laptop looks and feels much more expensive and rugged than you would expect for this price. Running Linux, you'd think this was a Core i5 at twice the price! This is a combination you just can't beat.
Good! Good  Good !Good !!
Excelente producto
I love it! Perfect for my needs. Works great and very inexpensive! VERY LIGHT!!!!!
If you read the reviews and actually know what you're buying then you shouldn't be disappointed. It's a quick simple computer th  The computer arrived at 12 pm the next day when I chose 1 day shipping.  I have no complaints with this computer so far. It is exactly what all of the reviews said it would be. If you read the reviews and actually know what you're buying then you shouldn't be disappointed. It's a quick simple computer that has incredible battery life. It's stylish and light and works well. The Quad Core processor is an added bonus. No moving parts. 4 Gigs of ram and 2 USB 3.0 ports. Boots really fast and came with 1 TB of Google Drive storage for 2 years instead of the advertised 100 Gigs. No complaints there. I'm excited to watch how Chrome OS develops further and gets better and better and more popular just like anything Google does.
Notebook is much faster than I expected.  Asus provides good products.  Now to find an operating system that is worthy of this brand.
I Love My Computer  Perfect computer for my needs. I am a stay at home mom and I use my computer for internet browsing and light photo editing.  Pros Compact Light weight Runs cool Able to withstand the occasion drop SD card reader USB slot Back lit keyboard Island keys HDMI port should I need it  Cons No disk drive
Great product  Retina Display is amazing, but some software (particularly Office for Mac) doesn't play well with it.  Excel is slightly fuzzier than with my old MacBook.  Couldn't tell much difference with Word.  However, the real deal is Solid State Drive.  Finally, a computer operates at near the speed of your smartphone, i.e., click a button and the software is open.  No long waits for the computer to turn on, off, or software to load or to shut down.  If you lack patience, this is the laptop for you.
Early impressions: Really nice, could have some driver or Win10 issues out of box.  This is an evolving review. (11/6).  Out of the box, this thing is fantastic. It's not TOO heavy, the matte black with accents really looks nice and feels good. Typing is fine on this. I installed a second 250GB SSD, and have an extra stick of RAM coming, for a total of ~$125, which is too good to pass up.  Running Witcher 3...At highest settings, it is still a bit slow and choppy. That wasn't too important, but at low/med it is flying. To me, I'd rather it be smooth than to see each blade of grass. The fans are pretty quiet...and the laptop did not get hot at all. Good stuff.  Removing the bloatware: There isn't much, but I get confused with the Dell support stuff and Windows 10. I didn't do a 'clean install', not sure how or if I need to. I updated Wifi, Nvidia and Intel drivers. I don't have too many issues with the trackpad. Seems ok for me, but I use a mouse 90% of the time.  I am getting an issue when I put this in sleep/hibernation, then wake up. CPU idles at 50% up to 100%...and system freezes / lags / chokes about a second or two every 10 seconds. I'm not sure what is going on, but it is probably some process I have yet to identify. Restart solves the problem. I need to play around with this a bit more as I just got it yesterday, but so far - it's good. I just have some problem adjusting to Windows 10 right now.  UPDATE: This machine is great. I installed two more updates (below in comments) that other users said helped with sleep. But I recommend not using sleep at all. Change your power button to ShutDown. This machine takes 10 seconds to boot up, there is no point to put it into Sleep mode.  Seeing a bit of screen bleed when the machine is booting up, but can't tell even when I'm looking at a rendered black screen. So far, really happy with purchase...though, not sure I like Windows 10!  Playing Witcher 3 is really smooth and nice at Medium settings, and I could probably go higher.  The sounds is pretty crappy, but that is true of most laptops. I bumped it up a star, to 5 - because even with lackluster sound, some updating, and a less then precise trackpad....this is an awesome machine, and you can't beat the price.
Beautiful laptop and serves as a workhorse  Pros: Beautiful lightweight build Backlit keyboard Perfect for medium weight heavy processing tasks also 1080p gorgeous display 802.11ac and Bluetooth v4.0 Energy star rated 750gb Plenty of storage  Cons: Memory and Battery are not user upgradeable Laptop is moderately sturdy (Can be improved a bit though) Battery life could be improved a bit.
Awesome machine! So fast can't believe it!
The computer works fine. Have not any problems with it. We are completely satisfied with it.
It's in great shape and works great as well  Received Google Chrome Acer sooner than I expected.  It's in great shape and works great as well!
Wonderful, recommended.  Excellent laptop. I bought a SSD and installed on it, it was the first time I saw Windows 7 started in 7 seconds.
Great price on a great laptop  Great price on a great laptop. Very nice looking and seems like it will hold up well for my use.
My 10 yr old daughter needed one for homework.  This does the trick and then some!
Latitude computer  We have a Latitude computer,, it is the E5400. It was givenn to my son to use with his school work. We have had it all school year. Because of it's durabliity and size we have just started using it as our home computer. It is 11:54 pm and I am online looking to see how much it would cost to replace this computer. I have to give it back tomorrow and I don't want to. We have nine children all have touched/used this computer over the last nine months nad it is in amazing condition. It has wonderful keys. I just really like it. And if I can afford one I will be getting one.. or perhaps two. Really no joke. it has not crashed nor has it been repaired. We have had not one problem with it. I would  highly recomend this computer. Really I will miss it a lot.
I love it! but try not to make the light turn red, as the inner temperature will be too high.
What's not to like about this?!  It's powerful, inexpensive, portable, and durable!  I have two laptops in my bedroom, but my go-to machine is this Acer C720 Chromebook.  In fact, I do about 90% of my computer work on this machine.  It's lightweight, powerful, and boots up almost immediately.  I can easily carry it anywhere......took it in my carry-on luggage to Europe (learned the hard way that it should be removed from the bag before going through security checkpoints.)  In the past, I've had problems with laptops getting infected with viruses, malware, spyware and all kinds of malignancies.  The Chromebook is basically immune from these problems, saving me from countless late night hours trying to remove the "bugs" that infect our computers.  The device charges quickly and holds its charge for several hours, depending on how you're using it.  I've had this one for almost two years now and it has never given me a second of grief.....undoubtedly one of my best purchases on Amazon!
Exactly as described and by far the best laptop I have ever owned and shipping was fast!
Very satisfied.  I purchase this laptop for my daughter and she loves it.  For school and watching videos, music, etc.  Very satisfied.
Excellent ASUS  I truly explored my options before buying. My trusted computer repair company owner helped me decide. He discussed with me exactly what I needed for the work and hobbies that I use my computer and the ASUS is living up to my needs and expectations. Thanks Amazon.com for making it less impact on my pocketbook!
Great computer. Feels like an iPad but also a computer!
This was a gift and they were very happy with it,
Very happy with our new computer.
gus - brazil  hi, im gus, from brazil. ive ordered this hp laptop and everything is going well with it. no problems with the pc and it was delivered in time.
Amazing Laptop! Worth the price!  This is an amazing laptop. If you have reservations, don't. It is definitely worth the price and you won't regret it. I had only used Windows computers before buying this one and had only bad experiences that have resulted in money wasted, that could have been invested in just buying this computer in the first place.
The best
I like the computer it does the things I want and need it to do. Would have liked to have a start up video on how to use a Apple computer. This was the first time I had purchased one. Once you learn how to use it and understand its features.  You'll enjoy the use of the cumputer just takes time getting use to it.
Exactly what I expected
Would be a great computer without Windows 8  I thought that purchasing Windows 8 with a touch screen would be the solution to all the complaints I have heard from people who purchased Windows 8 computers without touchscreens.  I find everything extremely difficult to figure out.  Though I really know nothing about Windows 7, over the past several years I have never had issues in getting it to work. If I find the time I will learn how to operate Windows 8, but it would have been nice to be able to use the computer right out of the box.
Bought it for my mom and it's been great  My mom needed a computer to replace her 2008 Acer Aspire ONE netbook. I was originally thinking an ultrabook or macbook, but then I decided to get her the C720 Chromebook, and I'm very glad I did. This thing is fast and does everything my mom needs it to do and nothing else.. no more phone calls about installing applications, connecting to the internet, etc  The chromebook is the future of laptops, most people don't need mobile workstations or gaming computers.
Great laptop! more than I expected!
Like Asus  I bought this for my roomie. He has been using it throughout the life of his PhD. Most ASUS products i had are reliable.
Nice laptop for the price.
Wonderful  Great battery life.  It is cheap.  Only negative is the washed out matte screen.  People who think the idea of a chromebook is dumb are wrong.  Loaded arch linux on it in a chroot and have the best of both worlds.  It takes 5 minutes to put into developer mode, locate the script on github, download said script and execute it.  You now have a full blown notebook computer capable of quite a bit.
I love this laptop!
It was a Christma gift for my daughter, she loves it!
Great
excelente
Fast, light and functional  It's not a laptop.  Laptops are computers and are built for processing data locally with applications like Photoshop, Premiere, Painter and so on.  This is an Internet Appliance.  It is designed to get you online quickly and easily and to facilitate use of online apps like Google Docs, Facebook, Wordpress and so on.  I do much more of the latter than the former and this little beauty makes it soo easy.  It's a great companion on an airplane too and comes with a pack of GoGo Inflight Internet credits.
Excellent computer  I've had this for over a year and it still works just as well as when I got it! Occasionally people will use it and tell me that's it much faster than their computers but I don't know because this is the only laptop I've ever owned. I use it for basic web browsing (no gaming or anything) and frequently have multiple browsers, windows and tabs open at the same time and it doesn't slow down. In general I'm very happy with it and I love the touchscreen.
love it
Love this laptop. Apple starts a new trend.
Great Laptop
Great Computer, Ridiculous Power Cord  I've had this laptop for about a week and a half and so far, so good. Love the touch screen, the lightness, and the very slight purple hue to the silver. I'm a writer, and I always worry that going to a smaller laptop will make adjusting to the keyboard hard, but that wasn't the case here. Everything works really fast, and Windows 10, so far, is not as awful as everyone makes it sound.  My only caveat with this is the absolute ridiculous design of the power cord. They put all the power supply whatnot right on the plug, so it's too heavy to stay in any vertical-mounted outlet... which is most outlets. When I have to use one, I literally have to tape the darn thing in place to get it to stay (see photo). That's my only true gripe about this computer.  Asus, I'd promote the person who does your packaging and fire whoever designed this power cord! ;)
Gaming laptop for work too  Powerful laptop to run virtual machines with memory upgrade. Boots faster with M.2 SSD upgrade. Not a hardcore game but games do run with good graphics. Not Virtual Reality (VR) compatible, knew before buying. Looks and feels sturdy. Red backlit keyboards feels strange initially for work but you get used to it.
Premier pro just fine.  Runs by adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, In design, Premier pro just fine.
Pretty good for the price
LOVE apple products.
good  All good so far, but it is irritating to have to write a review for them. the computer is great though. I love Windows 8.1. I used Ubuntu, win7 and macos before. I love windows 8.1 the most and the touch-screen makes everything easier.
Hardly Any Complaints! I Love It!  I absolutely LOVE this laptop. It runs pretty smooth, it started to slow down a bit (for a VERY short period of time) but not in an unbearable way. I think it's definitely b/c I downloaded The Sims 3 but it runs pretty fast again so that's not a problem. YouTube would always act up. But the past couple weeks Firefox has had updates and it runs more smoothly. Also, I don't think that's the Laptop's fault. Haven't really had any issues w/ the software or anything. I love it. This was my first laptop and I couldn't be happier. I only have one complaint, a tiny one. I wish that it would adjust to sunlight. Sometimes I can't see my screen when I'm out in the sun. I try to turn the brightness up to only find that it's up to it's highest level so I have to go find a shaded area. This can get annoying sometimes but other than that it's great!
great little computer  Dyno-mite! great little computer.
Great Product - Greater Service  Everything's great - only one con - minor one - the Sony has disabled the virtualization setting in the BIOS - so you cannot run 64bit virtual PC (to test Windows7 64 bit).  Otherwise a great product.  And the promotion for a productivity / mobility pack is great too!
Acer Aspires continue to amaze me  I recently purchased an Acer Aspire 15.6" laptop to replace my HP from 5 years ago. I had never tried an Acer before so I was a little nervous. Needless to say, I absolutely love my new Acer laptop! When my girl friend needed a new laptop, I recommended an Acer since she needed a backlit keyboard. We found this one on a website and based on the only 2-star review we were worried. But again, Acer has wowed both me and my girlfriend. She loves the laptop. its a perfect size to bring with her to class and she loves the backlit keyboard. When on battery power, the keyboard light will turn off after about 10 seconds until another key is pushed. While Jack complained about this in his review I think its a great idea. It saves battery when not in use but is there when you need it. If you are plugged into A/C power, the keyboard is always lit up.  The touchscreen is extremely responsive and is one of the better ones I have used. The bonus 6GB RAM is also very nice as 4 is not enough, but 8 is a little overkill for her needs. The screen has your standard 1366 x 768 resolution which is fine. The battery lasts for about 4 hours when browsing the internet. It could be better, but with plugging it in isn't a big deal to her.  This laptop runs pretty cool, even when using many programs at once. I'm not sure if Jack just got a faulty laptop but I think that this is one of the better laptops you can get for a great price. We paid $270 for a used one but it was in perfect condition. For $270 this laptop gets 8 our of 5 stars! But for over $500, I still would give it 5 stars. It is a great laptop overall and checked every box my girlfriend was looking for. It's lightweight, fast, and the chicklet style keyboard makes it easy to type with.  I have purchased 3 Acer Aspires in the past few months (2 in the V5 series and 1 in the V7 series) and have been impressed with all of them. The V7 was for my girlfriend's mom and she absolutely loves it.  When it comes to finding a laptop that you plan to use for a long time, I would always recommend Acer. Most laptops charge a premium for touchscreen and backlit keyboard but Acer makes this a standard for most of their models at a great price.
Good Value  So far, so good. Only had it for about a month, but I really like the back lit keyboard.  The touch screen is great to have too for presentations. The processor doesn't seem to warm up too much.  I think it's a good value.
Wont find a better laptop for the price.
After a year of use - this remains my favorite Chromebook  From a form factor stand point this is still one of the better Chromebooks around. It has a really nice shape and design - almost a premium look to it even though the casing is plastic. Portability is excellent as it is thin and relatively lightweight (2.9 lbs) and the display is plenty gorgeous with full 1080p resolution on an IPS display. I have the Celeron version with 4 GB's of RAM and for most cases with Chromebooks this one definitely gets the job done as I frequently have anywhere from 10-15 tabs open at once and the system handles it all with barely a stutter. The keys have good feel with just a bit of travel to them and the track pad is a winner with good precision handling very light and gentle swipes and 2-finger 'right clicking' as good as my MacBook Pro. Best of all this system has a backlit keyboard which is a feature not normally found on Chromebooks and especially at this price range.
very good!
Fantastic machine! ASUS does it again!  I've had this machine now over a month and it's been flawless, perfect. Performance is impressive, running even the most intense games with all graphics settings maxed with no problems. All my other apps work great too. Very fast and stable, no issues. Besides gaming, I do software development and audio and video editing and all work very well on this machine. Love it!
I don't actually have one.....  Okay so I don't actually have a Chromebook, but my school does, and I have three words for it: ABSOLUTELY WONDERFULLY AMAZING!!!!! I love this laptop. It's very easy to use, and I just like the setup. I like that it already has Google Chrome (My favorite web browser) installed. I like that it is a little different from Apple and Microsoft products. This is going to be a really short review.... But anyways, this is an amazing laptop that I REALLY want, and you should REALLY want it too!
It's a Mac
Does exactly what I need it to do!!
Macbooks are overpriced!!! Go chromeBOOK pixel  MacBook Pro Killer :) @ 1/2 the price...
Great loved it  Super price and everything works great very small blemishes and not an issues. These 630 are work horses Dual Core just added 2 GB of memory and off and running. Thank You!!
"The" Ultraportable  I have used this for 2 years now and won't settle for anything else even now.  This is an ultra slim notebook that makes a powerful first impression,(people end up awing at it rather than your presentation).Itis among the best-engineered notebooks, has a very solid feel and VERY portable the clip-on extra capacity battery manages 6 hrs.  The lack of an optical drive can be a plus for many, now that usb flash drives and sd flash cards are so popular and cheap.
Amazing!!!!
Old version but came in great shape.
... received was exactly what was described and it works great!  The product we received was exactly what was described and it works great!
Great for my designs!  Working like charm even on drive across country. Perfect for graphic design.
It really good laptop.  Work hard and look great
Used very little!  Computer got here very quick. No visiable signs of wear at all. I've used this model alot and like it very much so I wanted another one. i would use these people again ,but I hope i don't have to.
this laptop is great...no problems so far
good for the price,
Great for general computing  I've had this computer for about 1.5 years, and it still works great. I generally use it for web browsing, word processing, and video games. The i3 with 4gb of DDR3 RAM can play games like Skyrim on low setting, so it's not great but it still works. I recommend upgrading the processor to an i5 and to 8GB of RAM.
reliable great laptop 3 year review  I have had this laptop for almost 3 years. I had updated the memory and nothing else has been done. I had lost the charger and got myself ebay replacement which destroyed the port by expanding. Gateway fixed the port for free and sent me a replacement charger.  I did get lot of viruses which made the laptop overheat so linux or replacing the windows every two month will help you last this computer for very long time.  only complaint is speakers and wifi card (not as good as other laptops but if you have excellent router this will not be a issue).
GREAT SURFACE BOOK ALTERNATIVE!!! GREAT DEVELOPER MACHINE!!!  I purchased the ASUS Zenbook UX303UB because I needed a replacement laptop that I could keep for a while. I wanted a device that was at the top of the market currently but in 4 years would not be a horrible PC. I believe I have found that in this laptop/ultrabook. I am a software engineer and IT instructor so I needed a device that could be flexible enough for me to host a class on the go, but powerful enough to handle all the Visual Studio coding and SQL querying I could throw at it. I needed something that was fast, but also was expandable (not many laptops/ultrabooks allow for expansion). The graphics card is not the best, but it is great for me where I am mainly watching Netflix and YouTube.  The 12 GB of RAM, I7 processor, and 512GB SSD are very nice. The device powers on and wakes from sleep mode very quickly. The touchscreen is accurate and responsive. I was looking into purchasing the surface book, but when I broke everything down I would have had to get the most expensive on which was $3k+. I got the same thing here (minus 4GB of RAM and the disconnect ability of the undocking mode) for almost $2k less. I will just invest in a tablet if I feel that I need one, but otherwise I'm good with my purchase and would buy it again.
Great combination of size, weight and battery power  Have been using this laptop for about one week now.  So far it has been wonderful.  It is not the fastest laptop I have had, but it has the best battery life, very light and thin, and can run the programs that I am intending to use it for without difficulty.  The screen looks great, the computer looks sleek and my daughter uses it for the whole day without needing a charge.  I bought it for her to use it at school, and neither of us are gamers.  The only negatives are the extraneous software that I proceeded to delete, and all the idiosyncrasies of the Vista OS.  I am sure it will be much better after I download Windows 7 in October.  So far, it has exceeded my expectation for a laptop that I wanted to get for my daughter.  I would recommend it without reservations to anyone who are not planning to play serious games or do heavy duty video editing on it.
Up to now the best lap top I have ever owned  Up to now the best lap top I have ever owned. Thanks for giving me the chance to own one.
The best laptop I've ever had!
At this price you can afford to buy 3 and you'll be happy you did!  I rarely write reviews and usually only if I feel that the product has gotten a bum wrap. Why this laptop doesn't have 5 Stars across the board blows my mind and further convinces me that a lot of people that write reviews do it for the sole intention of writing something negative. I paid $233 for one of the sturdiest and most well designed laptops I've ever owned. This thing has a solid state hard drive with plenty of processing power and ram to do just about anything you need with maybe the exception of serious video editing. I bought this Lenovo with the idea of leaving it in the car and taking it to work on my lunch break to fiddle around on the internet. I figured that the price point was such that even if it got stolen or destroyed I wouldn't lose sleep at night. But this thing has exceeded my expectations by miles. The only other laptop that I've bought at this same price point was a chrome book with 16GB of hard drive space. This won't be the only one of these that I buy, probably in a week or two I'll be getting a second one if there's any left. I recommend you do too. If Lenovo is somehow offering this product at such a low price to gain customers it worked. I'll probably never buy a brand besides this one for a long time.
Samsung Series 7 Gamer NP700G7C-S01US 17.3-Inch Laptop -Worth it? Oh Yeah!  Just basic information up front.  I debated this purchase for about 2 months, looking at all of the different competitors' models, Toshiba, Dell, HP, and ASUS. For me it came down to Toshiba X875-7290 or this model.  I had to wait for over 6 weeks for the Toshiba model to finally hit the market, in the end; I went with the Samsung model.  (What you should know is that I own several High-end laptops already, I own 3 Toshiba Qosmio's systems and an earlier Dell Alien ware system, still went with this model based on the reviews that I had read!)  Consideration 1 - For the money, this is about the most cost effective laptop and the least expensive model.  (I did not buy (this laptop) for this reason - it was just a strong selling point for me!)) Plenty of the competition that fell at the same price or slightly more expensive, had a weaker video card (important consideration), smaller HDD configuration or less system memory.  Consideration 2- Display. I kept reading about the amazing display, I had to check it out for myself.  It is worth it, Resolution will match all others, but this display is bright, sharp and crisp.  It is the best display that I have seen on the high-end laptop. (Included without an upcharge.)  Consideration 3 - Audio - well worth it - sound fantastic.  Beats all others that I have, you can play music in one room and hear it clearly in another!  (Not a technical review, true, but something that almost anyone can relate to.)  This is a laptop, and sounds are natural, loud and clear.  Consideration 4 - Keyboard is fantastic.  Keys are well spaced and feel great, again well done.  Consideration 5 - Plays all games that I have thrown out it with no issues.  I am running Adobe CS Suite 6 and it is quick, by far the best experience that I have had with running the software on any system.
For the price this cant be beat.  The hardest part was figuring out how to connect to our printer.
Great computer
best laptop!  I purchased this laptop new in 2008 and it has worked like a charm! I immediately upgraded the memory to 4GB; although I knew with vista I could not take advantage of the entire 4GB.  The Duo processor does support 64 bit , so I'm upgrading to Windows 7 to finally use all 4GB memory and most of my applications should perform fine.  I did use my extended warranty twice this year for damage I caused! The only issue I have is the fact it does not support the installation of a 2nd internal hard drive although the space is available but no connectors.  But for the price I paid, I'm happy! Got it from local CompUSA, the last week it was in bankruptcy business!  One discrepancy, the laptop has 6 USB slots not 4 as indicated in the technical description.  Toshiba Satellite P205-S6347
Finally found a good fit  First off I would just like to say that I have spent a lot of time researching laptops for school.  I was stuck in between wanting to get a top of the line gaming laptop or an ultrabook that I could take to classes and for general utility.  I went with this model because I really liked the other reviews I had read about it.  I wanted something with 6 gigs of ram because I felt like 4 gigs was becoming outdated and didn't feel like buying something obsolete.  I can easily confirm that this laptop is one of the best investments I've made for a computer in years.  Out of the box you look at the laptop and in your head you kind of get an idea of how heavy something is by looking at it right?  Well you will be totally blown away when you pick up this laptop.  It's so incredibly light it doesn't even make sense.  I boot it up and I'm already on my desktop messing around with programs.  I would highly recommend this ultrabook to anyone who needs something that's portable, yet extremely powerful.  Just as a side note, this ultrabook will run games pretty easily.  I play World of Warcraft and it seems to run just fine on this ultrabook.  Don't let it's small size and weight make you think this pc doesn't pack enough power to do pretty much anything you would need.  It's also very quiet, to the point of where I can't even hear it over the central air in my house when it's running.  One thing that's new for me is the keyboard.  While very responsive the keys do not press down very much and as someone who has been using a gaming keyboard for years where the keys press down a good bit it takes some getting used to.  After a while however, the keyboard feels really good when typing.  Another cool feature that I really liked was the "fn" key.  When pressed it brings up a little diagram on the top of the screen that shows you what happens when you press the other buttons with the fn key pressed down.  Overall I would highly recommend this ultrabook.
Productive Laptop  Great laptop and lasts up to six hours. I love how it folds and its touch. I can carry it everywhere and work a long while without worrying about charging right away.
AWESOME Value, AWESOME Product  Awesome, especially for the price. Chrome OS is a seamless operating system experience. Though low in price and with an Intel Celeron processor, I have had absolutely zero issues with speed on this chromebook. It works just as quickly for my needs as my Mac. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this product! Plus, for $149, you absolutely cannot beat this price!
The Main Problem With Samsung Products  This is my second laptop from Samsung. First time when you start your laptop, you will realize that it comes with a lot of unnecessary pre-installed demo software. An antivirus, MS Office, a lot of games, an OSX dock clone, Samsung "smart" battery manager etc. Of course the first thing I did was to format the machine and make a fresh install of Windows. But the problem you will realize after reinstalling windows is that, Samsung does not send any CD for installing drivers. This is still ok but even their website does not show this laptop in products list. So it is not possible to easily go to website and download the drivers. Their website shows NP700Z5C-S04US on products list but NP700Z5C-S03US (this laptop) is not listed. So if you want to download drivers, you are gonna have a bad time.  As I do not have a day to try finding and installing correct drivers, I had to install a linux to make the laptop usable. Of course as linux releases are always buggy, I could not see the real performance of the machine.  Besides this software problems, the machine seems pretty solid. The design is really good and I also like the screen. Obviously I can not comment much about GPU/gaming performance.  As I said in the title, this is the main problem for samsung products. If you are giving me a Win 7 PC, just send me a CD with drivers included. I do not need you to bloat my PC with unnecessary software. I just want to be able to use the machine without spending a day or so.
good purchase  Good-looking laptop with great price. The CPU is fast enough for family use. Decent memory size for this price and 500GB Hard Drive is more than enough if you don't have too many downloads. The screen is big, sharp with high resolution and has really wide viewing angle. A lot of USB ports which is very handy.
Good Price, AMAZING warranty, and Love in One 16" Package!  Great laptop! I had an initial problem when I started it up, BUT IT WAS A PERSONAL PROBLEM. The hard drive comes preinstalled with a partition, a big one! I mean they gave me ~ 130 GB for OS & program files and then ~ 370 GB of free space. I did not like this partition because after installing all my programs and games I had about 30 GB of free space left on my OS drive (C:). Plus all the document files were linked to the C and I had to put them on the D because I have ~ 290 GB of personal files. Anyway I called them up and it was AMAZING! All I had to do was boot up hold F9 (I think) and it has the restore installed already into it. I restored with no partitions and now it runs and feels amazing. I think this may be a Windows 7 thing, but I am not sure. Another thing that amazed me is the 1 year of accidental spill and drop protection. When you get the computer ASUS even gives you another year (I think) if you fill out the registration within 30 days of purchase. Oh and when I called to get my problem solved customer service was amazing! Quick, to the point and with the right solution! AMAZING SOUND!
Great product for the price  The laptop came in earlier than I expected! Started it up and it runs so much faster. You can multitask and game on this as I normally do. The resolution is 1920x1080 which I wasn't expecting. Processor is a intel corei7 6500u(6th Gen) which is also very nice. Still getting used to the resolution though too! Battery life has been good so far. The GPU is a Nvidia graphics 940M which is a good mid range GPU for gaming. Not for very demanding games, but still good. For the price of this laptop and what it has to offer, I would say it's a steal of a price!  I will update this more after I get adjusted as well as adjusting the computer more.
The Asus X540LA - A Very Nice and Well-made Computer  My wife and I use computers with GNU/Linux operating systems.  However, in order to update our Garmin GPSes (we have four), we need to use a computer using the Microsoft Windows operating system.  Back in 2013, I bought an&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ASUS-X502C-Core-i3-3217U-Dual-Core-1-8GHz-4GB-500GB-15-6-34-LED-W8-Laptop-White/dp/B00GYK8IB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ASUS X502C Core i3-3217U Dual-Core 1.8GHz 4GB 500GB 15.6" LED W8 Laptop - White</a>&nbsp;which fulfilled that need.  However, the more I used it, the more I appreciated its physical merits (display, keyboard, sound quality, etc.) and, as we decided we needed a new computer to take with us on trips (and did not want to spend a lot of money), I decided to buy a new inexpensive Windows computer and convert the Asus X502C to Linux.  This older Asus works positively great as a Linux computer. It is light in weight and is a pleasure to take on trips.  Unfortunately, the computer I chose for my new Windows one was this&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Acer-Aspire-One-Cloudbook-14-Inch-HD-64GB-Windows-10-Gray-AO1-431-C7F9-includes-Office-365-Personal-1-year/dp/B014YN6YZ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Acer Aspire One Cloudbook, 14-Inch HD, 64GB, Windows 10, Gray (AO1-431-C7F9) includes Office 365 Personal - 1 year</a>, a disaster if I ever saw one! (You can read my very lengthy review if you wish; it details my travails with this machine and its Windows OS from November 2015 until earlier this month.)  Having the choice of just discarding this Acer Aspire One or converting it to Linux to see if I could get some use out of it, I chose the latter option. (It finally does work as a computer but the major problem with its internal battery - discussed at length in my review - persists.)  Of course, for use with those Garmins, I needed a new computer with a Windows operating system. (So there went my intended savings!)  Based on extensive research here on Amazon as well as other places as well as my past experience with the Asus brand (see below), I chose this&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Asus-X540LA-SI30205P-15-6-Inch-Laptop-Intel-Core-i3-4GB-Memory-1TB-Hard-Drive-Windows-10-Home-Silver/dp/B01DMNX5PS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Asus X540LA-SI30205P 15.6-Inch Laptop (Intel Core i3, 4GB Memory,1TB Hard Drive, Windows 10 Home), Silver</a>.  I'm glad I did (at least so far).  It arrived yesterday and I went through Windows' setup procedure. I added just two (2) programs: Garmin Express and CCleaner. (I also uninstalled the MacAfee antivirus program; I do not wish to pay for any programs on this computer and, as it has essentially only one use, Windows Defender and Windows Firewall are just fine.)  Though configuring, updating, and cleaning took about five hours, the computer functioned just fine and everything was finished around 9:00 PM last night. Among other things I deactivated as many of Microsoft's 'spying' settings as was possible.  This morning I turned the computer on and updated all of our Garmins. The entire procedure went smoothly, something that could not be said about that Acer Aspire One. (During the eight months that the Acer was a Windows computer - and during the short periods when I actually had it in my possession and it was not at Acer's repair station - I was only able to update the Garmins once. And that updating was very troublesome; because of 'freezes' and so forth the process took two days to complete!)  The keyboard on this new Asus X540LA is excellent, with a very good "feel" to it. The display is very nice; it's crisp, it is easy to read text, and viewing on it is easy on the eyes. The speed of the Intel i3 processor is very good, much better than Intel's lower lines (Pentium, Celeron, etc.), and I am pleased with its speed. It even has a built-in CD/DVD drive, something which more and more computers are eliminating. And with all that, it weighs relatively little.  Obviously at this point I cannot comment on longevity. But this is my third Asus computer (the other two are still in use) and, considering my experience with this brand, I expect that this one will last just as long and will give as good service as the other ones. Naturally, should there be any problems, I shall report them here.  I can recommend only one accessory: a laptop bag. This&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Case-Logic-Bryker-15-6-34-Laptop-Bag-BRYB115/dp/B01EHG3360/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Case Logic Bryker 15.6" Laptop Bag (BRYB115)</a>&nbsp;in the one I am using. It is a very nice well-designed bag. (This&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/AmazonBasics-15-6-Inch-Laptop-and-Tablet-Bag/dp/B00DUGZFWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">AmazonBasics 15.6-Inch Laptop and Tablet Bag</a>, which I also own, is much less expensive and is also very nice.)  In the mean time, if you are in need of a very good, fast, feature-laden, and lightweight computer for general use or for use when traveling, I can highly recommend this one.  I thank you for reading this report and for taking my opinions into consideration.  Lawrence H. Bulk  ===== Update: September 29, 2016  The following is just an FYI concerning the Microsoft Windows 10 operating system, NOT the computer itself.  This past Sunday the Windows 10 Anniversary Upgrade (version 1607) installed to the computer.  After that upgrade was finished, I found that there was a new version of the CCleaner program. I downloaded and installed it.  Within the program there was a new option: Old Windows Installation.  I checked that option.  Then I began the cleaning process.  That process took thirty-eight (38) hours to complete! I know that that amount of time is hard to believe but it's true.  Frankly, I was afraid that I had destroyed the entire operating system and I was tempted to shut off the computer. But I resisted that temptation and I'm glad I did.  When all was done, I shut down the computer, waited about a minute, and then restarted it.  I fully expected to see some sort of 'failure' notice.  But no. The computer booted up and operated perfectly and it continues to do so.  But I have to tell you that this was a 'white-knuckle' process which lasted over a day and a half.  This sort of thing is just another reason why my wife and I continue to use GNU/Linux operating systems rather than Windows.  Thanks again for reading this.  Lawrence H. Bulk  ===== Update: October 24, 2017  On Saturday, October 21, 2017, the computer downloaded the new Windows 10 Fall Creator's Update, Version 1709.  After the installation was complete and the computer restarted, I started the cleaning process with the CCleaner (which is set to delete the <windows.old> files, in other words, the obsolete previous installation). This was at 5:30 PM EDT on Saturday (the 21st) afternoon.  The process took SIXTY-ONE (61) consecutive hours, finishing just this morning, Tuesday (the 24th) at about 5:20 AM EDT.  Oh brother!!!  Then I found out that there was a newer version of CCleaner introduced just today! So I downloaded and installed that.  And, after updating the one other extra program I have on this computer (Garmin Express, now version 5.7.1), I restarted the computer and ran the new CCleaner (which has some extra cleaning options).  Then, of course, I "defragmented" the computer. Those two processes took about an hour and a half.  When all is said and done, I essentially have a brand-new Windows 10 computer.  Most people do not go through all of this rigamarole. But, with Windows keeping all of the detritus, NOT doing this is what eventually slows down your computer and you think that it's just getting old and it's time for a new one. (That, of course, is what Microsoft and the computer manufacturers WANT you to think!)  Knowing about all this and doing it is all well and good as it does completely renew your computer but, if I had to have Microsoft Windows as my only operating system, well, I wouldn't even WANT to own a computer!  Just give me Linux!  Lawrence H. Bulk
Fantastic laptop for work  Bought this to run VSA software (VIPRE).  Came with Windows 10, which took a little getting used to.  Highly recommend it for business programs as it has been very reliable.
Excellent Laptop and Gamer's Perfect Traveling Companion  Bought this after reviewing it online and reading about its cooling system which I believe is the achilles heel of all laptops. This laptop has an excellent well designed cooling system and was my primary reason for buying it. The video card and i7 chip were my other reasons. The machine is well designed and has every bell and whistle you can imagine. Highly recommended especially if you are a gamer and can't leave home without your games.
Great Laptop  I purchased this monster from Amazon.com and am overall quite happy with my purchase. I mean just look at what this monster has to offer:  * Intel Core(tm) i7-2630QM Processor * Genuine Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit * 17.3" Full HD Anti-reflective Display (16:9; 1920 x 1080) * NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560M (DDR5 1.5GB VRAM) | NVIDIA Driver Downloads * Accelerated performance with MSI TDE Technology * Full-color programmable backlit keyboard by SteelSeries * MSI Cooler Boost Technology * Dynaudio Premium Sound Speakers * 1TB hard drive with Raid 0 * 16GB DDR3 system memory * USB 3.0 for high speed data transfer * HDMI 1.4 (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) output * Built-in 720p HD webcam * 802.11 b/g/ n Wireless LAN with Bluetooth  I love this laptop to death which is why I'm giving it 5 stars, but to help potential buyers decide I'll just list some of the cons that may affect one's decision.  First off, if the BLK (Back-Lit Keyboard) is a deal-breaker for you, you may want to consider looking up some youtube videos to see the color and brightness for yourself. There is a small section of the keyboard where the keyboard isn't as brightly lit as the rest of the keyboard. (Around the iopkl;,. section.. may just be my laptop but from what I've read, this is typical for all GT780Rs) The area there is a little dimmer than the rest of the keyboard, but it's not too noticeable and I personally don't mind it too much, but I'll warn that you may not be happy with it so look for yourselves. (Also the ALT and CTRL keys are a little brighter than the rest of the keyboard). I have seen that some people claimed that their laptop's keyboard seemed to be slow (there was a delay between hitting the key and it showing up on screen as well as some keys having to be pressed very hard in order to register). Well, my laptop doesn't have this issue, it's flawless and well if you do have the delayed keyboard problem I remember reading that there was a new driver released to fix the problems with the keyboard. (I type 80+ words per min so I would notice if characters were delayed.. and this probably isn't too much of an issue since mine in not affected). I DID (past tense) have a problem with the touch pad. After using it for awhile, it would sometimes just stop responding and it sometimes jumped around the screen without me touching it. MSI released a new driver that fixed that issue so that problem has been resolved. This rig does not have hotkeys to control music players. (Like the Play/Pause/Skip buttons.. at least to my knowledge.. maybe I'm just a clown and can't see them..) I am a bit upset that I can't press the next key when I want to listen to another song, luckily I use Winamp and you can set hotkeys for that. I also can't turn down the volume down without using my mouse or having to press the FN key down. A little bit of a bummer but nothing worth worrying about IMO (in my opinion). As for the sound that this monster makes, generally I can't even hear the laptop in a silent room unless I put my ear up against it. With the fan on MAX SPEED it can get pretty loud but if you need the fan that high, I'm sure you'll be playing a game or something, and any sound that the fan makes is completely drowned out by pretty much any noise the speakers make (not on highest volume settings too!) Oh also, there is some bloatware pre-installed on your laptop.. easy enough to remove but a little annoying. (MUCH less than some other companies though)  Overall, although I listed only the CONS of this laptop, I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone. Watching HD movies on this thing is amazing!!! OH! Also beware this is NOT a GLOSSY SCREEN. Some people complain that the white on the screen is kind of grainy and not white white, so just beware.. although I personally prefer matte screens. Also I play Starcraft II with extreme settings on with no problem(at the same time leaving Winamp on, firefox open with 2957834 tabs open, downloading movies in the background, anti-virus and other background programs), hopefully it will be able to support GW2 and D3 when the time comes.. Some of my friends love to brag about their new MacBook Pro for college, but once I show them what I got, they just know that my monster > macbook pro..(even if they know nothing of computers) Having a better laptop than people makes me feel good about myself.. BWUHAHA.. So buy it and show off :D  Well that's it.. not really any more issues from my end. Oh and if you want to read up more about experiences with this laptop, google GT780R Owner's Lounge.. It should be the first one on the search, read up on the laptop and some of the issues that some people have. (Keep in mind you'll read more about issues since people don't generally post if nothing is wrong)  Hope my review helps!
A very well appreciated present!  Mac book Air, on Amazon... Enough said really. Great, great product! I felt very confident buying it on Amazon, too. Everything was as I hoped it would be. I did a lot of research before buying and was NOT disappointed!!
Very satisfied with this product.
Great little laptop. Love the color, its fast and portable, does exactly what I need it to.
I need  a wireless mouse!  I am not a tech wiz and  being the simplistic person that I am I find this laptop extremely easy to use. The only thing I probably do not like about this laptop is the mouse pad. Its probably me, in fact its definitely me, but I always end up clicking the right button. Ive had this computer for a few weeks now and for some reason i cannot adapt to it so I'm considering purchasing a wireless mouse.
I just love my computer, boots in 3 seconds and is much better than my macbook air
Works like a charm  I bought this for the sole purpose of streaming on my TV.  Works great!
great  exactly as described. but the outside box was opened and damaged but the interior box with the computer was not.
Good Durable stylish laptop recommend to buy  the laptop in general met my expectations except the hybrid VGA and the screen resolution since maximum takes 768 in height which is the main issue i am facing i hope it has a fix with an update to driver at some time but in general i recommend it.
Dell a good deal  For the price it is a great Texas made computer,thank you Dell and Amazon! Looking for more Dell,thank you very much,happy in Pearland,Tx
Solid but slow  Got this nice inexpensive laptop so I could work from home. Like all the Dell Latitudes I have experience with it is a solid little computer although it won't break any speed records.
Great purchase.  Just an awesome and powerful, super fast PC!
Perfect  Arrived on time in perfect condition.  Looks brand new.  Came with OEM Apple charger plus extension cord.  Everything works like brand new.
Serving me well
very great laptop easy to use love windows 10 and I would highly recommend this laptop
love it.  My husband bought this laptop for me, love it.
Very NICE LAP...  This laptop is really good ,looks nice ,i can see the quality ,works very fast but only need a change (SSD) and you'll be in the heaven,i been playing MW3,GTA4,Battlefield 3 and runs nice,the cpu fan do not make almost noise. Only has windows 8 Home edition and there is not serial number in the computer,so think about it if you want upgrade your hard drive by SSD.The sound sound great so clear...,no heating or anything weird  update:now even whit the original  hdd the boot time is 10 second maybe less  update: looks like the intel core I7 processor is ready for turbo boost but ,in the bios there is no option to activate it,so i think that the board intel does not support turbo boost,i tried to install t boost gadget and gives me a error saying that i don't have a processor capable whit turbo b technology.  update:the new bios update has fixed all isues,now is a dream,/i love SONY ;)  Attention to all those that got this lap,go to the sony's website and update your bios,this will improve the system stability , [...]  other thing is tha you can upgrade the ram up to 16 gb,i got the confirmation here ,just run the assistant from crucial and it will tell you how much your pc support [...]
Extremely happy!  Very basic, but does the job.  Extremely happy!
great product
Great value for the price. arrived on time. great buy!
Like New!  Like New !!! Enjoy
the battery life is great, the screen is bright and clear  Not too much to review here, the battery life is great, the screen is bright and clear, the keyboard feels good, and the 14" model is very portable and does not weigh too much.  All in all it's just a great work machine.
Great PC  This little PC is fast and a great buy.  I didn't realize that it didn't have a CD drive, but I can live without one.  It's lightweight,  speedy and easy to use. A great buy for the price.
Windows 10 is must easier and user friendly then the windows 8
This Sucker Is Fast!  I was looking to get something simple for school. I wanted something small and something that would run fast. My University always has an up and running internet connection so this Thin Client was the perfect fit for me having to type up papers and stream movies and shows whilst on my down time. It was money well worth spent.
Great Budget Laptop  These are most definitely refurbished units, so don't expect it to look like a brand new laptop. The unit that was sent to me came better spec'ed than the description, which was a nice surprise.  The keyboard, mousepad, and monitor have no significant marks.  The HDD was wiped clean and a fresh install of Win7 was reinstalled.  It came with no bloatware, and ran faster than any new laptop I've ever bought.  If I have any complaints at all, it's that the battery seems a little weak. But, hey, batteries are cheap, so I'm not going to knock off a star for such a small thing.  If you're on a tight budget and need a laptop, this is a much better option than some cheap new netbook.
Love it so far  I really like this laptop so far!  I bought it to replace my 5 year old Dell laptop.  Be careful when reading the reviews..most of the reviews are for the 8GB version and I purchased the 12GB touch version.  The laptop is super speedy and I have not had the problems with the "flimsy base".  So far so good!  Also, watch the price!!  This product fluctuates a lot in price!  The day after I bought it the price went up $70.  If it goes up to high wait a few days and it will probably go down.
I'm very satisfied. Refurbished but new in every way  My first chromebook. I'm very satisfied.  Refurbished but new in every way.
Very Highly recommend  Im a freshman in college and I would Highly recommen it. It has amazing battery life, runs smoothly. Speakers are soft but I don't mind. Great product for a great price
muy bueno
Just right  Bought this as a light, shockproof Mac to run typical Mac software (Aperture, CS3, Office, Sente etc.) to supplement iMac. Willing to accept lesser performance for portable productivity. System is silent (fans are rarely on), SSD seems very fast compared with notebook-class HDD's  (for example editing video on EyeTV). Screen very readable. Truly just the right balance of capabilities for this kind of application. Macbook Pro would have been faster but not so much as to make a meaningful difference. Effortless portability and now (in its 2nd generation) more than sufficient speed particularly with the SSD is the reason to get this. Highly recommended.
Great
Everything perfect!
Samsung series 5 Ultrabook  Arrived on time and in tact. UPS left the package outside my door though because i wasn't home. This is not safe at all. I do not need my brand new laptop just sitting on my doorstep for everyone to see. Overall, the product is very good, Fast and extremely light.
great product
Arrived on time and no issues
Best Deal Ever.
Great high end Laptop super quality, all aluminum and no plastic  Purchased used (in 2015) from Amazon, high quality, all aluminum, no plastic. A bit heavy but industrial strength with rare Display Port for 4k external monitor support and, 32GB memory  High quality DVD drive without tray, loads like a car's CD player. Perfect HD screen (1920x1080). Even came with fingerprint reader for Log-on security.  Still has all the lights to show hdrive activity,WiFi activity, Bluetooth activity and lock. These indicators have all but disappeared on new computers (like the oil pressure, oil temp and battery gauges from new cars)   Great product at a fair price. 1st time Dell user and will now be my 1st choice in the future.
Great Little Laptop  I am writing this review on this laptop.  It is very light weight and much faster than I anticipated.  The keyboard is very comfortable and the size of the keys are great.  The screen is plenty big.  I have a desk top with two 21" screens but end up using my Zenbook most of the time.  I read plenty of reviews of many different laptops before I purchased this one.  Everything I read about this Asus Zenbook appears to be true.  I would recommend it to anyone.
Great Investment  I brought this iteam for my husband for christmas. Lets say.. He still has it in his lap! I myself will need to get one since my faimly has laptops.i love my playbook though be still would like a laptop. Best money can buy.
Love it. would buy again, and I am a picky buyer.  Is a great used computer. it came professionally restored. Appears to be used very little. The charger is weak. Can't use until it charges a little, because the screen will just blink. No big deal, just let it charge up a little if you have this after market charger.
good
awesome laptop. have been using it everyday with no issues.
It's a beast!  While this might be more of the older-style of chromebooks (tough, plastic, affordable), it is still one of the best values you can get! Sure, the metal 2in1 Samsung Chromebook Plus or the Acer Chomrbook R13 are nice to look at, they are also much more expensive. With the Chromebook 15, you get a total best that offers great performance in a tough package.  PROS -Screen - It's the biggest screen you can get on a Chromebook right now. The matte finish means there is no annoying glare, and the viewing angels on this are flawless. Once Android Apps arrive in the stable channel, this will allow you to run several side-by-side.  -Speakers - The Chromebook 15 has two top firing speakers, and they are by far the BEST I have ever heard on a laptop (maybe the 12" Macbook comes close). With the trend of thin, light, metal taking over - the speakers have suffered a lot on other Chromebooks (the Samsung Chromebook Plus speakers are a joke). Whether it is netflix, youtube, or listening to music - the speakers on this will blow you away.  -Build - Yeah, it's all plastic - but that means you don't have to baby this thing. I am very gentle with my electronics, but metal scratches and dings easily. The Acer Chromebook 15 feels solid.  CONS -Not a looker - The R13, Samsung Chromebook Plus, and Asus C302 all rival the latest Macbooks in terms of their appearance. The Chromebook 15 looks a lot like any mid-2000s mid-range Windows offering. It is utilitarian and does look a little dated at this point since Chromebooks have really upped the design game lately.  -Standard keyboard - this thing is huge, but due to the top-firing speakers, Acer had only enough room for a standard sized keyboard. So at times it can feel a little cramped and it doesn't have a full num-pad like a lot of 15.6 laptops do. However, once you hear the speakers, I think this is a worthy trade-off.  -Trackpad - It's plastic, so it isn't the greatest trackpad I have used. I haven't had too many issues with oils building up, but at times it can be a little touchy. I usually just use a USB mouse anyway.
The turn on quickly and are easy to navigate  My kids got these Chromebooks for Christmas.  They use them everyday!  The battery lasts for hours.  The turn on quickly and are easy to navigate.  My kids love them!
A Solid, Well Functioning Chromebook  I got this chromebook a couple weeks ago. I really like it. It's Stitched leather Design makes it look good even though it is fake. The battery is fine. Very light. I got it for school and it is good with docs. You can even do documents offline. Dispite people's negative comments about the display, I think it is okay if the screen is at the right angle. I do like apple's magnetic chargers a bit more but these are fine. Overall, this computer is doing what I want it to be doing.
Solid laptop for the money! Very fast.  Solid laptop for the money. I received mine on December 3rd 2015.  At first I had some issues reliably connecting to my home Wifi, but these went away after Windows 10 finished installing it's updates and I'd installed the latest driver for the Intel Wifi adapter.  The color was off at first (way too orange) but I was able to fix this by running the Windows 10 color calibration tool. If you have the same issue, try turning red down by 10, and green by about 4 from within this tool. Additionally I turned saturation down by 7 and contrast by 4, but this may be personal preference.  The keyboard is of very good quality. I can't speak of the touchpad because I use an external M570 trackball. The laptop itself is very light and the fan is super quiet. The exhaust is on the left side of the machine, a great innovation I think, since laptops with back plate exhaust tend to get blocked by my knees while sitting or reclining. I've gamed on the unit about 5 hours a day since purchase and never had an overheating issue. The laptop remained comfortably cool in my lap except from the exhaust port which is quite warm.  Regarding the flickering issue some are writing about: note that this is only present if the brightness setting in power management is set below 100%! So if you plan to use this mostly plugged into the power (which, for a gaming laptop, you probably will) you will never encounter this issue.  I confirm 60-100 fps in World of Warcraft at Ultra settings in 1920 x 1080. Make sure your power management is set to high performance for maximum fps!  Overall I am very happy with my purchase so far.
great little portable pc...  We bought the 12.5" and the 11.6" were both happy with our laptops!  The only bad thing about these small laptops is there is no DVD drive, I found something that works for me, I use those little USB drives you put on your key chain, I copy the DVD or CD's to the USB drive and just plug it in.  You FIRST burn the DVD/CD to an ISO image using a program called ImgBurn(imgburn.com - free) that makes your DVD/CD into an ISO file, then with the ISOtoUSB software(isotousb.com - free) you copy it to your USB drive, boom your done, now you plug in your USB drive into your laptop and install from your USB drive. One thing with the ISOtoUSB software it freezes for me when its writing the file, if this happens to you just leave it alone and open your computer, if you see that the size of your USB Drive is getting smaller then the program is working fine, once its done writing it will say Complete or finished.
Good product
Magnificent machine, chews everything you throw at it!  I love this computer, I'll mention its ups and downs, its not perfect. But hell it is one awesome machine.  PROS: -Awesome CPU, the i7-4720HQ will go circles to all those U cpu-s, never lags. -Beast of a GPU, the 960m 4GB GDDR5 runs CAD programs and games in full-HD (native res) at mid-high specs (even AAA games). -1TB of storage is enough for any desire. -8 GB of RAM runs like a charm. -The speakers are just perfect, rich surround sound, loudest laptop speakers I have ever seen! -Nice keyboard with elegant back light. -very good screen with sufficient back-lighting and really good color reproduction. -body design is elegant thin and nice, always nice to the touch (never is cold like aluminium and doesn't feel cheap like plastic) ,smudges happen easily though. And is quite robust. -lid opens with no problem -720p sharp camera, good for skype calls. (No selfie material though)  CONS: -with no SSD, the HDD really bottlenecks the system. -Cooling can be better, even though you never feel it since it heats up in the parts you don't touch. -Upgrading is horrible, if you want to open it, reconsider your priorities in life! -Touch-pad can be better, but you get used to it quickly. -Battery life is kinda short 3-4 hours, maybe stretchable to 5 if used correctly (a beast system uses power).  EXTRA: Personally I was really annoyed from the HDD speed, so I bought a Samsung 850 EVO and put the OS in it. Runs much much better, OS loads in a couple of seconds. And I still kept my 1TB so I also have a lot of storage. Also upgraded the RAM to 16GB (You have to unmount everything in the computer and it is a horror show) because I used too many RAM-intensive programs like CAD, VM, programming at the same time. It is a really good value computer and would recommend it to everyone who wants/needs a powerhouse machine which will handle everything you throw at it, and will continue to do so for a long time (You won't need to change this one).  But if you are not an engineer/gamer/architect/enthusiast who needs a powerful machine, I'd look somewhere else, something more lightweight for browsing and other casual non-intensive tasks.
Great laptop powerful
ok
AMAZING  THIS IS A GREAT LAPTOP FOR EVERYDAY USE IN TERMS OF FUNCTIONALITY. CONSIDERING THE PRICE, I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS LAPTOP AS YOU GET MORE BANG FOR YOUR BUCK WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY FOR A BRAND NAME LOGO (ALTHOUGH ASUS MANUFACTURES PARTS FOR THESE SO-CALLED BRANDS). FIVE STARS FROM ME!!
Just perfect!  Just perfect!
chromebook  love the touch screen
Great value! Love it!
Great price  Very happy with purchase
Love it.
Best choice, I love it!  I love my Chromebook!!! It's fast, easy to use, simple in nature and looks great. I've gotten several compliments on its appearance. The webcam is a little low quality, but it still gets the job done. Keyboard and mousepad are light to the touch and comfortable. I've had my chromebook for a month and use it everyday for work and leisure, I enjoy it very much!
Love the product but the packaging wasn't great  Love the product but the packaging wasn't great. The tape came off and the box was I guess too big for the product. I love the laptop and that's what matters.
I  brought it for my husband and he loves it.
This computer completely exceeded all of my expectations.  When I bought this computer, I was expecting it to use it as a small, low cost of operation ($7 / yr for continuous operation) home server.  I decided that before I set this up as a server, I would see how Windows 7 ran on it.  I was surprised to find out that Windows 7 ran flawlessly once you let Windows Update automatically update all of the drivers, and restart a couple of times.  Since installing Windows 7 on this machine, I have made the decision to stick with 7 permanently, because on this machine, it runs even faster than XP.  It's biggest, and most initially unnoticable benefit compared to a regular computer is that it makes almost no sound at all.  I've been using this system for about a week now, and when I switch on my laptop to transfer some of my files, the laptop seems annoyingly loud in comparison.  Two weeks ago, I would've told anyone that as long as a PC wasn't roaring, it doesn't really need to be quiet, but finally experiencing for myself what an almost noiseless computer system sounds like, has opened my eyes to just how much a little bit of silence can contribute to a good computing experience, and a reduction of overall fatigue.  When I was looking at the fit-PC2, one of the things I read about was its video decoder hardware.  I thought that it was only a band-aid solution to not having a dedicated video card, but the fit-PC2 plays youtube and other online videos without dropping any frames whatsoever, even in fullscreen mode, which is something my 6-month old laptop with a Radeon HD 3400 video card cannot do reliably.  My only three complaints so far, are: 1. The USB connectors on the front of the enclosure are mini-usb ports, and in order to use them, you must purchase a separate adapter. 2. It only comes with 1 gigabyte of ram, and it is non-upgradeable.  Windows 7 can combat this somewhat with ReadyBoost, and I recommend purchasing a very fast 2 or more GB USB flash drive, or a few smaller USB drives to work with ReadyBoost. 3. The computer heats up too much, and I worry about how long the hard drive will last at this temperature.  I am considering attaching a few heatsinks, like the one Amazon sells here.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/43-X-45-X-10MM-HEATSINK/dp/B002TI8LJS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">43 X 45 X 10MM HEATSINK</a>  I would avoid recommending it to anyone who wants a computer for gaming, video editing, studio music production or tasks like that, but for simple word processing, database access, web browsing, light-to-moderate programming, home miniserver, or similar uses, it functions rather capably.
the best computer for more less money buy. Excelente, I recomend.
Great! Thanks a lot.
Great laptop  Works great and such a improvement from my old laptop
Recommend it!  No problems at all! It is a work horse and a sound machine. Smooth work with XP software as well.
Very good experience!
A great gaming laptop!  Met my expectations and then some.
Great computer at a great price. Shipped on time and packaged well.
Maquina Muy Potente  Con este equipo puedo sobrevivir a varas actualizaciones de Sistemas operativos. Una maravilla de la empresa DELL. Sin duda son uno de los mejores productores en ofrecer productos  al consumidor
Fantastic  This laptop is fast! After trying 3 other laptops, I finally got this one I am happy with. It literally boots up and shuts down in seconds. Plenty of storage with the m. 2 ssd and A 1 terabyte hard drive. I love the fact it has two drives.  I backed up the MSI burn recovery and saved it to A 3.1 type C flash drive (via 3.1 type C usb) and it transferred 25 gb of files in like 18 minutes. I have played 3 games so far and haven't had an ounce of issues with this laptop. Backlit keyboard has different colors that can be changed and customized. Optical drive burns files faster than my old windows laptop did.  I love how I can change the screen from movie, game, office, presentation, and eco off mode. The speakers are fairly loud with some mild base. the i7-6700HQ processor (quad core) and 16 gb ram is more than enough for what I do. The shift is cool, I can go in green, comfort, and sport modes. Cool boost button turns both fans on and cools fast, I haven't had any heating issues yet, its nice to have the cool boost just incase. MSI customer service is a lot better than other brands of laptops I have owned/ tried. You cant beat the lifetime free tech support! And this thing has A 2 year warranty. Other brands only had one year warranty and the tech support wasn't free after the first few calls.
first one i bought died within 2 months and had to replace it and now i am using the replacement which i play LOTR
This MacBook Pro is very very nice i like it !!
I love it! Small, light, dependable, easy to use, affordable
Fantastic Laptop  I have had this laptop now for several months and can't be happier with it.  The style is second to none.  It is very similar to the new ultra books, not as thin, close but has everything I wanted and a DVD drive.  Plenty of USB drives, has the new 3.0, has an HDMI, I5 and is super fast.  The battery is built in and last for hours, I get at least 7.5 hours no problem.  Also I really like the fact that this computer does not really get that hot.  I have had laptops that just heat up, this one stays cool.  The key is one of these new multi-function and works great.  The screen looks fantastic as well, put a movie in looks great and the speakers are very good.  Overall I am very happy with this computer
Best design and features for the price  I've bought three of these! I love convertible tablet/netbooks, and I am always trying to find the perfect one. I've bought others, but I always come back to this one. Honestly, I prefer my Android tablet, but I need this to print, scan, and type longer pieces for work. When Windows 10 comes out, I hope it solves the problem of the small icons and menus -- they are just too small to use without using a mouse. I think this is the best designed netbook, especially considering the price and the features that it offers.
Best of the Best!!  Thrilled with my first brand new never used laptop!!  Windows 8 takes some getting used to but I'll master it!
A trustworthy and Great Laptop  Works great. Can play any game i throw at it with ease. The sound is great. i sometimes hook it up to my tv with an HDMI but leave the audio coming from the laptop because its sounds better. The laptop looks nice to. Windows 8 can take time getting use to but you can get over it.  Overall a great product at a good price
Nice laptop. I love it  Nice laptop. I love it. The only thing is when you sign in as guest I don't see that you have much possibilities.
This computer exceeded my expectations and computer geeks setting up systems for me stumble all over the quality and deal I got through amazon!
My daughter loves it...
Qosmio X875-Q7380  Great machine though still coming to terms with Win 8.  Speed, display, audio all perform as described. Fast start-up a bonus.  Quite heavy, but that was expected. The feel of the touch pad takes a bit of getting used to.  Overall, I'm really pleased I bought this.
Great Investment
Yeah, it's sick  For me the choice in my new gaming machine was between the Predator 15 and the Alienware 15. Alien vs Predator puns aside, Let's do this.  First of all: This is the Predator 15 G9-592-71EF it JUST came out though it would seem almost identical to the G9-591 that Acer released end of last year. There are differences, and these are the ones I can confirm: 1) The back-lit keyboard is completely configurable color wise 2) The heating solution has been tuned 3) The trackpad lights up red (only red)  The CPU (Core i7-6700HQ) GPU (GTX 980M) and RAM (16GB DDR4) all perform exactly as expected. Reviews for performance of these components are readily available.  As another reviewer noted, there are two 256GB Samsung SSDs in RAID 0. These are SATA3 and not NVME. Also of note, I opened it up and confirmed that one SSD is B-keyed and the other M-keyed. They are also of different lengths though an adapter is installed to accommodate the second SSD. I suspect the machine is still NVME capable (disclaimer: when I contacted Acer support about it the guy said "your computer does not have that port") though my guess is that only the shorter m-keyed slot is compatible. I still need to test this. This link shows a complete teardown: [...]  I was able to get pretty good speeds from the SSD storage by using Intel's rapid storage technology to disable Write-cache buffer flushing  and configuring the cache mode to write-back. This increases the risk of data corruption of information in the process of being written to disk if you lose power suddenly, but I'll take the performance gain. I've included pictures.  Keyboard: Beautiful and just a little bit clicky. I really like it, its solid and not mushy nor clacky. The back-lighting is good enough, though from a users standpoint most of the light you see is coming from underneath the keys straight into your eye which can be annoying to me. I understand that this is true of many backlit keyboards but coming from a lenovo Y500 it was a bit much. I turned the color of the keys to be a very dark red which translate irl to red but as though I had turned the brightness down. This was helpful as there is no way to adjust the brightness of the back-light otherwise. Only on or off.  Body: Just awesome. I like to compare the Alienware (of which I have 3 friends who own one) to more of a Star Trek design appeal and the Predator to a more BattleStar Galactica look. It has an aggressive, rugged, industrial, utilitarian image to it. It screams "I'm a Beast" to behold. The hard rubber looking and feeling plastic is comfortable, solid and covers everything except the screen bezel which is a very good looking matte plastic. I love the way the screen has a gap underneath it (you can see right through it) so that the status lights on the body below the bezel are showing whether its open or closed. I'm not sure why I think its so cool, its just different. Opening the lid feels as good as opening a MacBook and can be done with one hand. The predator logo is a bit gaudy I guess but I still like it just fine. Also, when turning off the keyboard back-light the lights on the trackpad and on the lid turn off as well.  Screen: The panel on the machine is really great. I usually like glossy screens myself because colors pop more vibrantly to my eye. This matte screen is truly great though. It's plenty bright and I haven't noticed ghosting even though I've read reviews where this can be a problem. However, I play mostly RTS and MOBAs where ghosting isn't so noticeable as in a FPS.  Noise: This machine does make a fair bit of fan noise, but its much more a "I'm pushing through a crap ton of air" blowing sound than a "I'm a crappy piece of garbage" wheezing, screeching or buzzing one. Also the fans spin down very quickly after I'm finished gaming. I'm not bothered by it.  This machine is bigger in dimensions and weight than most 15" laptops. For me, I still like to use it on my lap unlike 17" models that I feel are just too clumsy. However, while my Lenovo Y500 just barely fit in my 15" laptop backpack, the Predator 15 just barely doesn't. So keep that in mind.  In general I love this machine and I have a feeling it will last me a good long time.
amazing screen, very happy with this purchase  light weight, long battery life, amazing screen, very happy with this purchase!!!
Arrived on time and happy with the performance of this chromebook it might be old but the WiFi is fast
Love it !  I purchased this laptop as a birthday gift for my sister who is entering her senior year of high school and needed a laptop for school work and also for browsing the web, netflix etc and I have to say this laptop completely exceeded my expectations! It is very fast, the touch screen is very responsive and the graphics are awesome for such an affordable laptop! My sister absolutely loves it, Dell did an amazing job with this one!
HP Laptop  I am a computer specialist and am very pleased with the performance of this laptop. I would highly recommend this laptop to anyone.
I bought this for my husband as his Christmas gift. He loves it so much, and so far nothing is wrong. It runs very fast.
Just what I needed love it....
Amazing so far  I read over the other reviews and I was worried something may happen to my laptop like theirs.  I figured I'd give it a shot regardless since I needed a new gaming laptop and this one was perfect for my needs.  If anything I could fall back on the warranty and it would be fine.  So far after buying it and using it for a while nothing wrong has happened and it is running perfectly fine for me.  Runs silent almost never makes much heat.
Just what I wanted
Amazing so far for the price.
It's perfect.
Bought this for my mom.  My mom was wanting to get back online after a several year break.  Bought this because we didn't want windows 8 and to make sure she would like being online again without spending a fortune.  This was a great bargain.  Arrived quickly, well packaged.  No problems, and she's been using it a couple weeks.  It was actually better than expected. Everything was working fine and set up well.
Awesome  Love it!!
Amazing laptop, The best I've had.
Best Thing Evar  Love this laptop. On it all the time taking notes in class, playing games, and just checking up on my friends through Facebook and whatnot. Can't tell if the wifi issues from previous reviews apply to me but pretty sure they don't because the wifi at my school absolutely sucks and it works fine at home. Touchscreen works great but sometimes it's easier to use the trackpad for smaller icons that I have to select or for highlighting text (these are much easier with the trackpad but can be done just with the touchscreen)  Love the laptop, I recommend it to all of my friends.
Best First Computer, Use the Wi-Fi at work to keep your JOB.  Has everything. Buy this to use at work. You can lose your job for using the company computer for browsing and shopping Amazon on line, viewing Super Bowl Pools and following Basketball during March Madness. HR calls it "Time Theft".  Now, to keep the Lithium battery from aging to fast avoid elevated temperatures, shocks. Aging decreases the performance over time. In other words lithium battery manufacturers take a conservative approach and specify the life of Li-ion in most consumer products between 300 and 500 discharge/charge cycles (That's the number of re-charges). So if you recharge it every day for a year that 365 cycles. So the advice is plug it in, take the battery out and use the battery only when traveling without a plug. Environmental conditions, and not cycling alone, govern the longevity of lithium-ion batteries. The worst situation is keeping a fully charged battery at elevated temperatures. Battery packs do not die suddenly but the runtime gradually shortens as the capacity fades. Remember "planned obsolescence".  Very important, modern laptops run cooler than older models and reported fires are fewer. When running electric devices with air-cooling in bed or on a pillow, keep the airflow unobstructed. A cool laptop also extends battery life. Energy Cells, which most consumer products have, should be charged at 1C or less. Avoid so-called ultra-fast chargers that claim to fully charge Li-ion in less than one hour.
Great customer service after the sale  Customer service after the sale was great. The doo dad which operated the dvd was kaput. they sent me a new one with installation instructions. Very easy to install and now it works again.
100% recomended. Very good
A lot of bang for the buck... -1 because skype audio/video isn't supported on the OS  by Skpe or google.  Moves right along on wifi.
Trust me  I bought the MacBook air on an impulse, so when I got it and loved it, I was relieved to say the least. I listen to people (sometimes) and when everybody I meet with a particular product love it and say they would never go back, I smile and nod, but seriously I have never heard a person who owns a mac, complain about macs! It's always PC users. And now I know why, they're better, I could tell you all the reasons why, but then you wouldn't have to do your own research, and that would make you stupid, and in said situation you should own a PC. I should add it's 02:00 here in S. Korea on a friday night, you know what that means.

great product. worth the money
I've had this laptop for over 2 years now and I really have been quite pleased overall.  I will say that the packaging was not the most protective of the unit when I first received my order by mail.  But, that did not seem to affect the operation of the computer.  Originally, I had to replace my beloved Mac laptop, but this was a much more cost effective option.  I've never been a huge fan of PC's, but I figured it certainly won't hurt to be somewhat competent with both systems.  It came loaded with Windows 8.1 and that was not the best operating system,  for numerous reasons, mostly b/c it was not compatible with several apps I wanted like Open Office, and  Windows Defender was not the most effective anti-virus protection.  I was infiltrated several times early on in the first 6 months since purchase.  A co-worker (who was an IT guy) helped me out with several of the free anti-virus programs out there, but I still got infected numerous times.  During the first year, when it was still under warranty, I was able to contact ASUS directly and they did a factory reset for me.  This helped clear the whole infection mess, and I appreciated that they could help me in this regard. Eventually I just bit the bullet and went with McAfee--even if I had to pay for it.  No problems since, in the past 2+ years.  On another note about the year warranty.  Since I was not the most impressed with Windows 8.1 that this came loaded with, I called ASUS to see about actually downgrading to Windows 7.  I would not be able to do this without nullifying the year-long warranty, so that was something I just had to accept (for the time being)  Then came the free Windows 10 upgrade.  I took a while to jump on board (b/c I feared a larger learning curve than I actually needed), but since upgrading, I've been happy with this decision.  I like the format better than those useless tiles of Windows 8.  It's okay to have them some of the time, and with Windows 10, I get to be the one who decides how much of them I want to use (basically, not at all).  I have not yet downloaded Open Office (not a priority at the moment), but I assume it will work on Windows 10.  We'll see.  Of course the most other obvious shortfall is the fact that there is no optical drive in this machine.  But even Mac is discontinuing optical drives in their laptops, and now they are extras to add on, across the board.  I've lived without it for 2 years, but got an external optical drive as a gift this year.  Still haven't chosen an app to play it yet..been lazy to do the research (not a priority).  So back to the basic premise.  You get quite a lot for the money with this ASUS laptop and even with the headaches I went through, I learned something from them.  I don't believe it was the actual machine that was the biggest issue.  That seemed to stay steady and reliable throughout.  It was the operating system that was the weak point.  But that has been remedied with the Windows 10 upgrade.
Just a couple steps below a gaming laptop.  Being an avid gamer and artist, I needed an all-around laptop that -has a good battery life -could run programs & games fairly well (when I wanna take a break) -didn't look like a George Forman grill like most laptops -not over $900-1000.  At first I thought I was in over my head expecting such a laptop to exist. But with the new i5 and GT 540m, this thing is a couple steps below a gaming laptop. It can run Skyrim on high (although drop shadows to med for a smooth framerate). And a few other games as well, but I won't get into that. It's very slim and lightweight. Realistically, the laptop can last about 6-7 hours, around 3 while gaming. I'm sure the LED screen has a great helping hand in this.  FL Studio runs well, but I have to max out the buffer to prevent any sound popping. And Flash and Photoshop runs surprisingly well.  Has a built in webcam and mic, which work very well.  If I had any complaint, it'd be the lack of color choices. I remember seeing a red one somewhere else.  Other than that, it's the absolute perfect balance between budget, performance, and battery life.
Sleek and lightweight laptop - fast and gaming capable  <div id="video-block-RYFNUXHZ68YIM" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1xqwd-WDMS.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81V7JS3Y9BS.png" class="video-slate-img-url">&nbsp;The attached video is to give you an idea of how the laptop looks and a summary of my thoughts on this laptop. Here's my written review.  The one thing about this laptop that jumps out is how stylish and sleek it is. But it's not all looks. The 2nd gen i5 processor and gt 520m graphics card makes this an all-purpose laptop that let's you not only compute but also play some of today's newest games.  In this review I'll talk about the design and performance of this U31SD-AH51 laptop.  DESIGN  * The laptop's cover is very sleek and stylish. I love flush aluminum finish. However, it does attract quite a bit of fingerprints. It's not a huge problem though. * Love the wrist rest. It has a smooth aluminum finish. Feels great and looks great with it's dark gray color. * Touchpad is very sensitive and feels good. It feels smooth, yet at the same time rough. The right and left click is merged into one chrome click button. It's not too loud when clicked. * The border of the laptop has a glossy finish. Nice touch. * The edges of the laptop is very sleek. USBs, hdmi, memory card reader (on the right of laptop) are all nicely placed. Note that there is no DVD drive, so that makes it thinner. * The battery charger has a right angle head and a quality power block and chord. * Speakers are placed on the bottom edge facing the person.  Performance  * The nvidia gt 520m is what stands out to me for this laptop. 1GB of dedicated graphics memory is a huge plus. You can play newest games like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfare-3/dp/B00503E8S2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Left-4-Dead-2/dp/B002BRYXRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Left 4 Dead 2</a>&nbsp;at least in the medium settings. * The i5 processor is very capable and computing is fast and slowdowns are rare. * Love the battery modes - high performance, battery saving, auto, etc. It's nice to be able to change the modes according to the task. * Speakers aren't so great. Lack depth and volume.  Overall, I love the design and feel of this laptop. A fast, reliable, and gaming-capable laptop. A great combination of style, portability, and power. Highly recommended!
I love this laptop so much  I love this laptop so much! High end 4k graphics, fast downloads, and a 3.5 G processor. When playing mobas or fighting games on pc you can feel the difference big time. Truly an A class laptop!
