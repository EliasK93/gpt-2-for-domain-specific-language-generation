Too small and narrow.  I sent them back for refund.
POOR BUILD QUALITY! Amazingly comfortable  This shoe is AMAZINGLY comfortable but I've had this pair for 1 month and 2 days and they are already falling apart. Very poor build quality!
Feels like bricks or blocks of wood  Feels like bricks or blocks of wood.  Just like the 16s.  The 15s were the last good shoe for me.
Smaller than the size number  Not the one I expected
Bad shoes.  My feet hurt so bad after the first day using these shoes for work. I had to throw it away.
pass on this sneaker.  The Fila Ascente is a low quality product. The heal wore down after 2 mouths.  I wore it down to a point were it was useless. while it was an inexpensive purchase, I seem to have wasted my money on it. It lasted 8 mouths, now it is in the trash and taking up space in a landfill.
Way to small for the size. Hurts my feet ager about 2 minutes of wearing.
Does not hold up  Comfy?  Yes.  Durable?  No.  I've had them a month and they look like I've had them a year.  This is with no actual trail running or running of any kind.  I got them on clearance at a brick and mortar, I see now why they were on clearance.  If you want something that will hold up on the trails, look elsewhere.
Harsh ride  After years of wearing Asics, I decided to return to the Mizuno shoes that I had worn in the past because of the more narrow construction.  What a mistake.  I wore them twice.  The ride was extremely harsh.  They made running uncomfortable for me.
Too tight. Not as wide as they should be.
They suck
Disappointed  The shoe is tagged on the back as "all terrain".  This is not an "all terrain" shoe.  The shoe does well until you encounter water, then you had better come to a crawl or risk finding yourself prone on the ground.  I like the brand, just disappointed in this shoe
weak laces strap holder  ordered on Apr 7 and the lace strap holder is already broken. I'm not sure if I can get a refund.
Shoe lacks shock absorption  Nice shoe for walking. Has really poor shock absorption . The ball of my feet get hammered if I jog.  I bought the 4E and found the width about the same as any standard running shoe. I won't be buying Asics again.
Fake
Not comfortable.  I've worn the gel nimbus for years. I thought I would try these because they are supposed to give you more support. However, my feet have continued to ache and I now get blisters from them. Not a comfortable shoe in my opinion.
super narrow  be sure to try on in a store first.  These shoes run very narrow
Order any previous model of this shoe, but avoid 17  I love Mizuno Wave Riders.  I've run marathons in them and have been a fan of the line for years.  This is by far the worse model of the shoe that they've come out with.  While it fits perfectly well and is lighter than pervious versions, it quite literally started tearing into the tops of my toes by the second mile of my first run in them.  Later runs resulted in the same problems, raw and bloody feet.
Gel-Cumulus 18's are way smaller than same sized 16's  I was disappointed.  I had 5 pairs of the ASCIS Gel-Cumulus 16's.  They fit great which is why I kept buying them. Finally,  my last pair is wearing out, so I ordered identical size/width in the 18s.  They were so small/narrow that I could hardly fit my feet in and this is before adding my necessary inserts.  So I went to a long time local brick and mortar shoe store where a knowledgable, experienced salesman waited on me and got me into a couple of different models of New Balance sneakers.  What a breath of fresh air to be waited on, the old fashion way.  Service does trump internet buying, which is proven to be hit or miss (more of the latter when it comes to sizing).
DONT BUY THESE !!!!  I mean they look ok in this pic but don't buy definitely fake and you could get way better quality just going to a finish line !!!
look great and fit my 11 4E perfectly  Have purchased many a pair Made in U.SA (around 15 and 2 imported) the last 8 yrs. look great and fit my 11 4E perfectly. All except this imported pair. Neglected to see the imported info when purchasing. They looked great and seemed to be good quality but were a size and a half smallerand narrower than the size stated. Maybe a fluke. Buy US made.
While I like the overall look  I don't know what the intention was with the shoelace system on these shoes, but they're possibly one of the dumbest, most poorly-executed pair of shoes that I've ever owned.  While I like the overall look, this shoe fails completely in terms of function.  The shoelaces act as more of a cinch than an actual lace-up, to the point where the top of my foot gets sore.  And the cinch-type lace tightener comes out all the time and bumbles around, at which point I notice when I start snagging it.  I can't make it more simple than this - my standards in a shoe are low, but even so these shoes are an unmitigated failure.  I wouldn't recommend these to anyone.
Sole comming unglued after 1 month.  I really like these shoes. They are very comfortable and I use them when I don't want to wear the Vibram FF's. The problem is I've had them a month and the part where the sole is glued to the upper at the ball of the foot is comming unglued. I'm sending them back to Amazin for another pair. I'll update the review then.
shoe sizing  They seem somewhat narrow and a bit tight.  I chose the size based on two other pairs of Columbias that I have.  I hope they will stretch a bit.  I've already wore them several times and threw the box in the recycle.
Top of Show Jabbed into Foot  When I got these, the top of the shoe was made such that it jabbed into the top of my foot. Completely unbearable. It may have been a defect however.  I don't think it would be designed that way.
I ordered this product over a month ago.  The item was received within days, however, it was the wrong size item, so I returned it in the manufacturer's return package properly marked.  I am still waiting for a replacement.
No way waterproof.  The front top developed holes after few weeks of use. I have to put Duct tape to cover the holes to prevent water seeping inside. No way waterproof.
Buyer Beware  Be careful purchasing this style or any style from Nike. These expensive running shoes that are manufactured out of country are made of cheap materials that allow them to rip and tear easily. The majority of this shoe is made out of some kind of netting which ripped on the inside wall of my shoe, exposing the lacing that holds the lace holes together. This quickly became a larger problem when the lacing starting coming loose.  I would not suggest this shoe to anyone unless you plan on using them only when you run on a treadmill. These shoes are not even suitable to be taken outside.
Nice... but not for running!  These shoes are great for looks but it stops there, they are unsupportive and have not held up in the short time I have had them (only a few months). Foot pain after only a 3 mile run. Would not recommend for anyone who plans on running on a regular basis.
HORRIBLE Shoes.  the bottoms fell apart in less than 1 week.  Not normal wear and tear.  HORRIBLE Shoes....avoid at all cost.
returned to big
The Kismet was a disappointment because the size is not accurate  I'm normally a huge fan of Newton's running shoes. The Kismet was a disappointment because the size is not accurate.
I ordered according to the sizing chart. They turned out to be somewhat larger than expected size.
Narrow instep  I like the shoe. It's not bad for the price but the instep is way too narrow. I normally wear a size 12 and I ordered a 12. I'll have to return these.
Pour cuality, sole is coming at part, just in .two weed
Good product I use it a lot have no issues I like it better than my Nike
Poor quality for Merrell  This is the second pair of these I've purchased because they're very comfortable. But both pairs started to breakdown with defects prematurely. This latest pair the sole started pulling away after 2 months of normal wear. The previous pair the sticking came undone after 3 months of normal wear. Neither time was I within the return window. WASTE OF MONEY!
Broken heart  I owned predecessor of these shoes and I lost 20 pounds running in them 6 miles a day. Those shoes lasted forever. I probably put 700-800 miles on them. Despite being almost barefoot those were extremely confortable with sole thick enough not to hurt my feet. However with this iteration, Merell has probably made the soles thinner. It hurts your feet doing anything more than 3-4 miles. At end of the day Merell wanted these shoes not to last as much as their predecessor, and in doing so they are gonna lose loyal customer like me. I do not recommend these.
To narrow, Its for kenyan runners...
Very nice shoes, but they run small, I wear size 12 and this cant be bigger than size 11
They scuff very easy at the to of the shoe  They scuff very easy at the to of the shoe. Very unusual for an airmax product. I buy alot of airmax and have never seen this before.
possible knockoff shoes  The feel really unconfirmed. I do not think these are legit addidas. I love addidas bit these feel almost 2 sizes too small.
Poorly Constructed Shoe  I love New Balance shoes, but this one was not up to par. I only had to try them on to tell they had two major flaws that would cause sores to anyone running in them for more than a mile: 1. The combination of plastic and material made the instep bend and rub against the side of the foot. 2. There is a hard plastic on the toes that stops directly on the corner of the big toe. This juts into the toe making the shoe not only uncomfortable, but causing friction and rubbing that should not be there.  I returned the product after trying them on and walking around the house for a minute.
Narrow fit  Too narrow for my foot.  I am returning them so I did not actually run in them.  The Montrail Badrock is a better fit for wider feet.
SIZES DIFFERENT  seems new balance sizes are different for each style. really need to buy from brick and mortar store
Even tough I wear 10.5 I'll exchange them for 11 instead
DONT BUY  THE SOLE OF THE SHOE CAME OFF IN THE FIRST 3 TO 4 WEEKS
Disappointed  Last pair I had fit perfectly This pair, same size, make,and model are tight across the middle. Also this pair squeaks when I walk.
Not comfortable  Very small for the size
it the brand
