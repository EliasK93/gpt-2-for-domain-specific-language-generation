Too small and narrow.  I sent them back for refund.
POOR BUILD QUALITY! Amazingly comfortable  This shoe is AMAZINGLY comfortable but I've had this pair for 1 month and 2 days and they are already falling apart. Very poor build quality!
Feels like bricks or blocks of wood  Feels like bricks or blocks of wood.  Just like the 16s.  The 15s were the last good shoe for me.
Smaller than the size number  Not the one I expected
Bad shoes.  My feet hurt so bad after the first day using these shoes for work. I had to throw it away.
pass on this sneaker.  The Fila Ascente is a low quality product. The heal wore down after 2 mouths.  I wore it down to a point were it was useless. while it was an inexpensive purchase, I seem to have wasted my money on it. It lasted 8 mouths, now it is in the trash and taking up space in a landfill.
Way to small for the size. Hurts my feet ager about 2 minutes of wearing.
Does not hold up  Comfy?  Yes.  Durable?  No.  I've had them a month and they look like I've had them a year.  This is with no actual trail running or running of any kind.  I got them on clearance at a brick and mortar, I see now why they were on clearance.  If you want something that will hold up on the trails, look elsewhere.
Harsh ride  After years of wearing Asics, I decided to return to the Mizuno shoes that I had worn in the past because of the more narrow construction.  What a mistake.  I wore them twice.  The ride was extremely harsh.  They made running uncomfortable for me.
Too tight. Not as wide as they should be.
They suck
Disappointed  The shoe is tagged on the back as "all terrain".  This is not an "all terrain" shoe.  The shoe does well until you encounter water, then you had better come to a crawl or risk finding yourself prone on the ground.  I like the brand, just disappointed in this shoe
weak laces strap holder  ordered on Apr 7 and the lace strap holder is already broken. I'm not sure if I can get a refund.
Shoe lacks shock absorption  Nice shoe for walking. Has really poor shock absorption . The ball of my feet get hammered if I jog.  I bought the 4E and found the width about the same as any standard running shoe. I won't be buying Asics again.
Fake
Not comfortable.  I've worn the gel nimbus for years. I thought I would try these because they are supposed to give you more support. However, my feet have continued to ache and I now get blisters from them. Not a comfortable shoe in my opinion.
super narrow  be sure to try on in a store first.  These shoes run very narrow
Order any previous model of this shoe, but avoid 17  I love Mizuno Wave Riders.  I've run marathons in them and have been a fan of the line for years.  This is by far the worse model of the shoe that they've come out with.  While it fits perfectly well and is lighter than pervious versions, it quite literally started tearing into the tops of my toes by the second mile of my first run in them.  Later runs resulted in the same problems, raw and bloody feet.
Gel-Cumulus 18's are way smaller than same sized 16's  I was disappointed.  I had 5 pairs of the ASCIS Gel-Cumulus 16's.  They fit great which is why I kept buying them. Finally,  my last pair is wearing out, so I ordered identical size/width in the 18s.  They were so small/narrow that I could hardly fit my feet in and this is before adding my necessary inserts.  So I went to a long time local brick and mortar shoe store where a knowledgable, experienced salesman waited on me and got me into a couple of different models of New Balance sneakers.  What a breath of fresh air to be waited on, the old fashion way.  Service does trump internet buying, which is proven to be hit or miss (more of the latter when it comes to sizing).
DONT BUY THESE !!!!  I mean they look ok in this pic but don't buy definitely fake and you could get way better quality just going to a finish line !!!
look great and fit my 11 4E perfectly  Have purchased many a pair Made in U.SA (around 15 and 2 imported) the last 8 yrs. look great and fit my 11 4E perfectly. All except this imported pair. Neglected to see the imported info when purchasing. They looked great and seemed to be good quality but were a size and a half smallerand narrower than the size stated. Maybe a fluke. Buy US made.
While I like the overall look  I don't know what the intention was with the shoelace system on these shoes, but they're possibly one of the dumbest, most poorly-executed pair of shoes that I've ever owned.  While I like the overall look, this shoe fails completely in terms of function.  The shoelaces act as more of a cinch than an actual lace-up, to the point where the top of my foot gets sore.  And the cinch-type lace tightener comes out all the time and bumbles around, at which point I notice when I start snagging it.  I can't make it more simple than this - my standards in a shoe are low, but even so these shoes are an unmitigated failure.  I wouldn't recommend these to anyone.
Sole comming unglued after 1 month.  I really like these shoes. They are very comfortable and I use them when I don't want to wear the Vibram FF's. The problem is I've had them a month and the part where the sole is glued to the upper at the ball of the foot is comming unglued. I'm sending them back to Amazin for another pair. I'll update the review then.
shoe sizing  They seem somewhat narrow and a bit tight.  I chose the size based on two other pairs of Columbias that I have.  I hope they will stretch a bit.  I've already wore them several times and threw the box in the recycle.
Top of Show Jabbed into Foot  When I got these, the top of the shoe was made such that it jabbed into the top of my foot. Completely unbearable. It may have been a defect however.  I don't think it would be designed that way.
I ordered this product over a month ago.  The item was received within days, however, it was the wrong size item, so I returned it in the manufacturer's return package properly marked.  I am still waiting for a replacement.
No way waterproof.  The front top developed holes after few weeks of use. I have to put Duct tape to cover the holes to prevent water seeping inside. No way waterproof.
Buyer Beware  Be careful purchasing this style or any style from Nike. These expensive running shoes that are manufactured out of country are made of cheap materials that allow them to rip and tear easily. The majority of this shoe is made out of some kind of netting which ripped on the inside wall of my shoe, exposing the lacing that holds the lace holes together. This quickly became a larger problem when the lacing starting coming loose.  I would not suggest this shoe to anyone unless you plan on using them only when you run on a treadmill. These shoes are not even suitable to be taken outside.
Nice... but not for running!  These shoes are great for looks but it stops there, they are unsupportive and have not held up in the short time I have had them (only a few months). Foot pain after only a 3 mile run. Would not recommend for anyone who plans on running on a regular basis.
HORRIBLE Shoes.  the bottoms fell apart in less than 1 week.  Not normal wear and tear.  HORRIBLE Shoes....avoid at all cost.
returned to big
The Kismet was a disappointment because the size is not accurate  I'm normally a huge fan of Newton's running shoes. The Kismet was a disappointment because the size is not accurate.
I ordered according to the sizing chart. They turned out to be somewhat larger than expected size.
Narrow instep  I like the shoe. It's not bad for the price but the instep is way too narrow. I normally wear a size 12 and I ordered a 12. I'll have to return these.
Pour cuality, sole is coming at part, just in .two weed
Good product I use it a lot have no issues I like it better than my Nike
Poor quality for Merrell  This is the second pair of these I've purchased because they're very comfortable. But both pairs started to breakdown with defects prematurely. This latest pair the sole started pulling away after 2 months of normal wear. The previous pair the sticking came undone after 3 months of normal wear. Neither time was I within the return window. WASTE OF MONEY!
Broken heart  I owned predecessor of these shoes and I lost 20 pounds running in them 6 miles a day. Those shoes lasted forever. I probably put 700-800 miles on them. Despite being almost barefoot those were extremely confortable with sole thick enough not to hurt my feet. However with this iteration, Merell has probably made the soles thinner. It hurts your feet doing anything more than 3-4 miles. At end of the day Merell wanted these shoes not to last as much as their predecessor, and in doing so they are gonna lose loyal customer like me. I do not recommend these.
To narrow, Its for kenyan runners...
Very nice shoes, but they run small, I wear size 12 and this cant be bigger than size 11
They scuff very easy at the to of the shoe  They scuff very easy at the to of the shoe. Very unusual for an airmax product. I buy alot of airmax and have never seen this before.
possible knockoff shoes  The feel really unconfirmed. I do not think these are legit addidas. I love addidas bit these feel almost 2 sizes too small.
Poorly Constructed Shoe  I love New Balance shoes, but this one was not up to par. I only had to try them on to tell they had two major flaws that would cause sores to anyone running in them for more than a mile: 1. The combination of plastic and material made the instep bend and rub against the side of the foot. 2. There is a hard plastic on the toes that stops directly on the corner of the big toe. This juts into the toe making the shoe not only uncomfortable, but causing friction and rubbing that should not be there.  I returned the product after trying them on and walking around the house for a minute.
Narrow fit  Too narrow for my foot.  I am returning them so I did not actually run in them.  The Montrail Badrock is a better fit for wider feet.
SIZES DIFFERENT  seems new balance sizes are different for each style. really need to buy from brick and mortar store
Even tough I wear 10.5 I'll exchange them for 11 instead
DONT BUY  THE SOLE OF THE SHOE CAME OFF IN THE FIRST 3 TO 4 WEEKS
Disappointed  Last pair I had fit perfectly This pair, same size, make,and model are tight across the middle. Also this pair squeaks when I walk.
Not comfortable  Very small for the size
it the brand
Loved the looks but this 4e wide is not the same as other 4e by the same brand, it was so narrow I couldn't wear them for an hour.
Worst version of the 1260 ever!  They fit loose in the toe box and the break point seemed to be off just enough to rub against my smallest toe in the most painful way.  The material on the interior next to my ankle bone is too high and the edge digs into my bone. There seemed to be very little padding in the sole and my feet were dying after about 2 hours on my feet. I found a couple pairs of the V5 and bought them again. Skip this shoe, maybe the V7 will be better.
Faulty workmanship  I have owned 3 pairs of Nimbus 14 and have loved them. I decided to purchase the Nimbus 15 because of the color variety. But, much to my chagrin, I found the workmanship to be awful. Asics changed the pattern from the 14 to 15. The shoe top material is a single piece of material in the 14 including the tongue. On the 15, the tongue is sewn on to the top shoe pattern. All kinds of frayed material was left in the shoe at the point where the tongue was sewn on to the rest of the shoe. Wearing the shoe barefoot was impossible and I could feel the frayed material through thin socks. I addition, the 15 toe box seemed smaller than the 14 in the same size (12). I have returned the 15s and purchased another (boring color) 14. I was very disappointed to fine such shoddy workmanship in the 15.
Runs Narrow  I have several pair of New Balance shoes, mostly in the normal width and a couple that are 2E. Although these are marked as 2E, the toe width fits like a regular width. Otherwise, it is a nice shoe. I returned them  because they are too narrow.
Hey Brooks! Not all of us have a narrow foot. Build this shoe shaped like a foot.  Very narrow toe box. I didn't even stand up in them, my toes were so squeezed. Make room for the toes to splay.
Expensive Junk  Bought the M990GL3 a year ago and the right shoe seemed to fit a bit differently from the left shoe but not enough to throw them out. But now, I HAVE to throw them out as the arch and the heel on the right shoe came apart and the foam underneath is dissolving while the left is starting to separate in the same place. A New Balance rep said I must have gotten them wet... Long a New Balance customer, I am one no more.
Quality lacking....  Within a month of purchasing my NB993 they began to show wear on the side of the shoe near the ball of my foot. The material is certainly less durable than the NB991s I bought several years ago. Surprisingly, the wear pattern on my one-month-old 993s looks similar to the wear pattern on my three-year-old 991s. I am very disappointed in this purchase.
Over price yuppie crap  Way to expensive for this type of shoe  more like a water shoe  bottoms all but worn out in less then a week .  ..the more I think about it worst shoe ever
Very Disappointed  I have bought Brooks running shoes for years and I have never had an issue until now.  This shoe lasted only a few months with very light use.  They just completely came apart at the side sole and the fabric tore very easily.  I am completely disappointed in this shoe.  I need to look at other brands if this is now the standard quality of the Brooks brand.
I get really frustrated when I fit into the size (x) of a brand's shoe, only to buy the same size in a different model and find it fits completely differently.  In this case I had to get rid of them because they were way too narrow.
small 9.5  im a 9.5 in allshoes these shoes though are cut to small
Pass on these  The most uncomfortable shoe ever made
These shoes must have been a knock off to Salomon shoes - didn't fit the same. Quality just wasn't what I have grown to expect from Salomon.
not really supportive  not  really supportive
Poorly made, seams inside shoe rubbed immediately,  no support in instep, felt like rock. Disappointed last K-Swiss were the best shoe I have ever had on my feet.
Right shoe bump under arch makes these unusable - apart from that these would be great  I want to love this shoe, but it seems to have a defect.  I can feel a distinct bump toward the rear of the arch on my right foot when running.  It causes pain over anything but a short run.  When feeling under the inner sole, it seems like there is a prominent join or similar in the fabric or in the connection with the sole.  I can't wear them running, and would like to know if this is normal or not.  Is there a fix?? My left shoe has a bump in the same place, but it is much less pronounced, and cannot be felt through the inner sole.  That shoe is fantastic to run on and my legs seem less sore after running (except right foot). Other than that, fit and finish would be good.
Junk  Will never buy again. I may be hard on shoes because I walk my dog a few times a day. But I shouldnt notice the shoe is falling apart 10 days after the return NLT date has passed.  Tired of the crappy quality that companies give us.
NOT comfortable and I my feet hurt always after putting them
Eyelet broke the first time I cinched them up.
Small size
New Balance apparently runs narrow.
Not very happy  I ordered a MEN'S size 12 zig ultra running shoe.  I got a KIDS size 12 reebok reflex shoe instead. Not very happy about the mix up
Pump not functional  I bought these shoes to run my first 5k. Additionally I purchased insoles as well. A week before the run and two weeks after I purchased the shoes I started to gradually break them in. I thought I was inflating the shoes. Apparently the left shoe will not inflate at all and the right one inflates slightly, but all air is drained within minutes. Luckily the shoes fit well enough to run in as my only other alternative was a pair of extremely heavy Nike Air Max. Other than that the colors were true to picture.
Good
tab  to tighten laces up is broke  My new pair of shoes, the tab when you try to tighten up the lacing is plastic and broken on one side. i have no clue if there is replacement laces. If there is replacement laces, I don't know how to put them in because it looks like they were done at the factory.
Preworn dirty tight.  Second time I purchased a shoe and sent it back. Pre-worn, dirty. Tight fitting. Giving up. I was expecting a new pair of shoes.
uncomfortable  The product looks cool but is not functional. They were stiff and uncomfortable. I hope other puma products are better.
Very NArrow compared to the Clifton  I have other Hoka's, and these run very narrow. I only wore them around the house to break them in, and they are far more narrow than the clifton, with a horribly low heel counter. I am an 8D
Couldn't really try it... was much too narrow!
Waterproofing stopped working after 30 days of light wear. Currently I can't walk through wet grass (e.g., from morning dew) without getting my toes wet.
Look cool, If they only fit.
Too narrow & too shallow.
Quality  I was super excited to get these and I wore them 2 times and they are falling apart, look broke down ran down.
Poor quality  After a month of wear the shoes are coming apart at the seams, the insole has a hole in it making it very uncomfortable!!!! Not worth the money!
I feel a small uncomfortability in the left sole. Imdon't know why.
Don't buy  Shoes came with security tag on them had too use a hammer to get it off...
Sole coming off!  Sole started to come off after about 10 wears.
Totally disappointed!!  I'm so pissed!! These "NEW" shoes arrived scuffed up with a decent amount of wear on the soles. Totally disappointed!!! Should be ZERO stars!
The one shoe that fit did fit snug and felt somewhat comfortable.  I ordered a US size 9 and when they arrived, one shoe was a US 9 and the other shoe US 8.5. Still waiting for refund or exchange. The one shoe that fit did fit snug and felt somewhat comfortable.
Small Feel  Tight feel, slightly uncomfortable. And squeak on any surface other than trail .
size fits but comfort level way low then expected.
Disappointed  So my first overall impression was positive, I ordered the size 11, because that's what I take in vibrams, it was a little too large so I switched out for 10.5's. They seem to be an after hours Merrell  vapor glove kind of style and they seemed pretty durable. I really wanted to go light on them so I choose not to run at all in them [until yesterday when our workout consisted of a 1600m run]. The feel barefoot in them was good, but the material was slightly coarser than my other barefoot shoes, but my feet adjusted in about a week. They have good traction, they fit well. But unfortunately after 2 weeks of Gym Only use, the tread is already showing heavy wear. As you can see in the pictures it looks like I was working out on lava rock, not soft gym matts. I don't expect them to last more than another month, two at most. Sad day.
Not as cushioning as some other top running shoes  These shoes are not worth it.  They actually feel less cushioning that some other top running shoes like Adidas Supernova Glide 2 or Asics Nimbus 12, so if you need a lot of cushioning I recommend getting one of those.  Also, I don't feel any so-called energy return.  I tried returning them but the seller doesn't respond.
Solid support but a little too stiff. They were great for the bottom of my feed but wound up aggravating and old knee injury
... a half or full size larger-snug fit but a nice looking  i am a size 14 ordered a 14 should have gotten a half or full size larger-snug fit but a nice looking shoe
I can never wear them
3 weeks in shoe is fallinv apart :( Nice fit but a little tight  UPDATE: I had such high hopes for these shoes only to be disappointed. We are 3 weeks in and the sole has started to separate from the shoe. One to look for another pair of shoes :(  Original review: I have had these shoes a week and I love them!! I wear them everyday all day. They fit well, a little too well. They hug your foot very well but cannot be worn with socks.  At least I won't be able to wear them with socks. I did a 5 mile hike yesterday and they held up well. Time will tell if the support hold up.  I foot underpronates so support is very important. If I can get a good 6 months out of these shoes I will be happy.
Buy a bigger size or a better shoe.  There is a reason these are priced so low. I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing. Extremely narrow and tight. The material the soles are made of seems extremely cheap and like plastic, very slippery on our pergo floors.
The fit was not good I will not buy again.
Too small and they were ripped
Extremely disappointed  I bought these for the memory foam. Umm no memory foam in these shoes! Very disappointed in these shoes!
Ran very small, unable to wear them at all.
Narrow not meant for wide feet
Too small  I've worn size 14 for over 20 years, and have owned Brooks Beasts in the past, but this pair was too small. I went to a local retailer and bought the same model/style in the same width, but size 15 and they're just a tad too big, but still very comfortable. Definitely recommend purchasing a 1/2 to a full size up. Reading reviews for several recent releases from different manufacturers, running small seems to be a trend.
Disappointing quality.  I really like the look and feel of these shoes, but I gotta say Im disappointed with the quality. Ive owned them for 4 months and Ive already have had to glue the bottom part of soles because they are separating from the white part. Im also not a runners, this is just from everyday wear. Another thing I dislike is that they are very hard to keep clean.
To Narrow...  Loved the way these looked and the weight, but they were way to narrow.  I wear Asics all the time and these were so much tighter then the others in the same size.  Returned them to Amazon with no issues.
Poor quality!  I have worn these shoes for less than 2 months & they are coming apart. As expensive as these shoes are you would think they would last longer!!! Very unhappy with these shoes!
Check For Accuracy  There were no laces included. Annoying
The shoe just did not work for me. I tried to like it but it is too far of a departure from the previous kinvaras. If you are use to the previous kinvaras, this may not be for you. I have had an Achilles, shin, and hip injury since switching to the shoe. After a few months, I went back to the kinvara 7 and all problems went away.
WHAT HAPPENED??  Let me just state that I was a Huge fan of the Asics Gel Excite 3.i bought them over and over again.  I had pair of the 3 for running  and also for just every day use. They were so comfy and cushiony, I was so happy to have found them.  I bought them tunnel they stopped making G the and the few they still sell are prohibitively expensive. Which brings us to the new Asics gel excite 4. Im so disappointed in this sneaker. They are like cement blocks attached to my feet. Cushiony feel and comfortableness are gone. I will not buy another pair of these.
not for runnig  They are nice, but a I used it for runnig and I have right now a injury in my heel.  They are only for walking trail shoe.
Tight shoes.  Not impressed I almost lost my toe nails. Very tight! My first and last Brooks shoes unless they are willing to offer me an exchange so I can try if they have a better product. Like I said not gonna experiment with my money with them anymore.
this is not a woman's shoe!  Not sure what the deal is but I ordered this in a woman's shoe and got a man's and now Peltz shoe is telling me that it is Amazon's fault and that they have repeatedly told them this is not a color available for women.  Well if that is true, then why when they got the order (which clearly said a woman's shoe) did they not contact me??? I sent them back and am awaiting a refund...this will change if I get that but until then I am out the cost of the shoe, and the $10 it took to mail them back!
Saucony, Saucony... Come on.  I am sad, sad, sad. They changed all the good models for Wide Feet and now the soles seem too narrow and the top over wraps the foot. It looks like you are on Skates and it feels BAD ! I am running my old models into the ground.
Clarks undependable fit  For some reason these blue clarks are really wide, I can stick my whole hand down the to of them open handed of course, Even with thick socks there's a big gap. All clarks are not the same, I am now sold onSoft Walk mules, OMG they are so comfortable and they fot perfectly., I highly recommend trying this brand if you have and problems with the fit of Clarks, They are a bit more spendy but well worth it, they have memory foam in the foot bed, They are like walking around in slippers.
I have worn New Balance for years and always a 13 2E.  These were way too narrow in the mid-sole and so I sent them back.
Sole is too hard with no cushion whatsoever- could not wear it all day nor walk a mile, returning.
Wished they were the same design as my last pair  The design has changed since the last pair I had. The reflective stripe cuts across higher on the toe box thus pinching my toes. Also the soles of the shoes are not waterproof. I called NB and they said it was the design? That seemed weird to me especially if I want to run on wet surfaces. I don't like running in wet feet...yuk. I loved the last pair I had though. They were amazingly comfortable and I was tempted to make them a uniform requirement for my staff since they matched our scrubs and were like wearing slippers!
Very unhappy  I have many pairs of the Reebok Zigs. The biggest reason i purchase them is for there durability & support. But these were Terrible. The arch support & overall quality is not what i was use to. I still like my other Zigs , but not these.
It's too large but I love this shoes and there's no 9 or 9.5 available the same colors 
I recommend ordering at least a full size bigger  These were way too small! I recommend ordering at least a full size bigger, and even then, it may be too narrow!
doesn't really sound like a Nike if you ask  Started getting torn in 6 months, doesn't really sound like a Nike if you ask me
as you can see - the shoe fits great, feels great and actually became the best tennis shoes i think i've ever had - until they fell apart a month into wearing them. and of course, when i went to see if i could return them, the site told me "yesterday" was the last day for returns. i tried fixing them, but of course glue, not that one kind or even the special shoe goo stuff will adhere to the shoe. what a waste.
Very bad quality, fell apart in a month.  I have had them for maybe a month, the tread on the bottom has already started to separate from the shoe, I have already had to replace the insole, it had a hole in it and was making the shoe even more uncomfortable. I am not hard on shoes, I use these for work(maybe like 2-4 hours a day walking in doors, nothing harsh) and that is it.  Regardless of cost I should not be having to glue my shoes back together and replace things after a month.  I also did attempt to contact them on their website, no response and I just don't have time to be calling people and sending shoes back, makes no sense.
but these were terrible for some reason  Ughh,,,  I've had these before with success, but these were terrible for some reason.  Back to Brooks.
shoes  The shoes are in good condition but they  are about two sizes to small
Poor quality and they look and feel cheap  I'm quite sure these are fake. Poor quality and they look and feel cheap.
Won't recommend.  Runs very small, EE is not much wider than a D. Won't recommend.
Fall apart after 2 weeks  These shoes seemed like a great deal, but didn't hold up after a couple of weeks of use. I used them for short runs, biking, and walks. The first issue was the thin cover of the insert in the left shoe. It began to peel away from the insert at the back right heel. Ultimately, the fabric pulled away enough so that I have to try to hold it down as I put on the shoe to prevent it from bunching up under my heel. Next, the bottom of the right shoe started to separate at the heel and come unglued. I am not generally tough on my shoes. I thought that Fila was a good brand, but these sneakers are just falling apart. Maybe they are knock-offs?
Way too Narrow!!!  Looks great if you have the narrowest feet ever! Don't know why they make shoes so narrow, it's ridiculous!!!
Pretty crappy cheaply made shoe
Golf Shoes  Very disappointed with these shoes were them when it was wet were not waterproof. Now I know why they were so cheap.
Toe box is too small--I had to buy another pair of shoes..  Big toe began to hurt after several miles.
STOP !!!  NEVER BUY FROM SHOE SOURCE !!  I purchased this shoe  for my man along with another for my brand for myself. Thankfully the purchase for me came from a different company other than SHOE SOURCE. I have done business with Amazon muliple times. Do yourself a HUGE favor and stay AWAY from THIS COMPANY. Normal return to Amazon itself easy peasy.. Not SHOE SOURCE.. you can not wear (thankfully he didn't ) and must be packaged in the original box etc to return. YOU as a consumer are FORCED to pay the RETURN SHIPPING. Ohhhhhhh it gets better yet... SHOE SOURCE will NOT give you back your original shipping on your order. So for a pair of shoes you can not use you are out the shipping cost for both directions. After 25 e-mails (no exageration) I still do not have the credit on my account from SHOE SOURCE for any of my purchase. About the shoe itself.. the arch digs into the middle of the arch of the foot making it a very uncomfortable walk.. strange for an asics sneaker..  My advice to you.. find the shoe you love and look under a different vendor.. Amazon themself for the most part have been ok thru this nightmere, however I'm losing patience with their somewhat retarded customer service people.. GOOD LUCK Folks, and for your sake I truly hope you move on from this purchase ..
Poor construction  Poor quality construction shoe. I will say that for the couple months that i ahd the shoes that they were overall conforable shoes. However spending $160.00 on a pair of shoes i would atleast hope that the shoes hold up.  The main issue that i have with these shoes is that sole on the bottom of the shoe came unglued near the tip on the right and left shoe. I have never ever had a pair of shoes fail like these did second pair of shoes in about 6 months. Previous pair was the keyano shoes and they just wore out prematurly.  Sorry asics 2 pairs failed me i guess i am going back to nikes airmax
Actually, it looks much less attractive than picture. Materials are not qualitative - there are some defects on the sole and outside surface. I do not recomend for purchasing.
Small  Fit is smaller than usual. My size is 13, but I probably should have got a 13.5. Otherwise good shoe.
Sent them back, toe box too narrow.  Had to send them back.  I have a pair of X Missions that I absolutely love.  I like them so much that I bought a pair of X Mission 2s thinking they would be similar but they narrowed the toe box so much that I can't stand to wear them.  It's like wearing a pair of pointy boots.  They hurt if I wear them very long.  I sent these shoes back because they got almost exactly the same.
Not real Nike, not leather...
This used to be my husband's favorite shoe. He bought them for years  This used to be my husband's favorite shoe.  He bought them for years.  He no longer wants anything to do with the shoe and/or New Balance as the last 2 pairs fell apart within months.
Not durable  I wish I could say these were great shoes.  My first pair lasted about 6 months, and the second pair lasted less than 4 months.  I wore them 5 days a week in very light conditions (walking around an office), and running on a treadmill about 2x per week.  After just a couple of months they began to disintegrate.  Loops and stitching coming loose, the tread on the heel beginning to peel away, and the foam cushioning all but crumpling.  I really like New Balance shoes, but I will not be buying these again.
The shoes looks absolutely nothing like the preview pictures show. It wasn't even the right colour. Very disappointed.
Fit is smaller than the previous model.
So freaking disappointed  Wish I could put zero stars, really poor quality and they feel like the champs I got for half the price. Correction the champs have padding vs. these POS has No padding. The shoe runs wide and just has no "new balance" quality to it. Really upset I can't get my shipping refunded because I paid extra to get them home in two days. Don't spend ur money on these guys, they really do suck. Stick with the 992's honestly.
The shoes look nice but they feel nothing like indoor soccer shoes they are very stiff and heavy they feel more like skate shoes definitely do not recomend for indoor soccer, i would have to find another use for them cant afford to trash them, in the mean time i will continue to use my running shoes for soccer which sucks .
Watch Closely  I purchased them for the apparently low arch support. I found the pictures misleading. If you have low arches, I don't recommend these shoes. I couldn't wear them for more than an hour.
These shoes were cheap garbage that fell apart within 2 weeks I will never buy this brand of shoe again!
poorly graded, wrong size  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/New-Balance-Men-s-ML574-Core-Plus-Fashion-Sneakers-Black-Grey-9-5-D-US/dp/B018NFZ1K2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">New Balance Men's ML574 Core Plus Fashion Sneakers, Black/Grey, 9.5 D US</a> I always buy size 9.5, this is the first time that a sports shoe is small for me. I do not know what happened? I understand that the footwear was poorly graded. I am dissatisfied with my purchase.
Neo Nazi shoes!
Worn out heal cushion  I love Asics and have owned many pairs through the years.  These however have been my first disappointment.  I've had them for a little less than 2 months with moderate wear (~8 miles running / week) during that period.  The problem is the heal cushion near my ankle has completely worn out to the point that the inner plastic causes blisters on my ankle/heal every time i attempt to run in them.  Unfortunately, I'm beyond the 30 days return policy so i'm stuck with them.... Frustrated as i thought these would be a great pair of running shoes.  btw - i put "Fit as expected" above because they truly fit great.  They just wore out in the heal way too quickly.
Started wear through in 2 months very disappointed.
The shoes run a size to small  I ordered a size 7 which is 9 n women because that's the size I wear. I had to give those away and order a size 8 because the shoes run small.
Even though I ordered a wide it fits tight in the front
Perfect fit...almost  These have heel slip and I can't wear them. They do have the the build quality and comfort I need. Its a near perfect fit in the toe area, which is really difficult for me. However, they just slip on my heel and there is no fix. I sent them back.
Too small  The shoes are small and one shoe is size 10 and The other is 10.5 i can`t returnt it because im un other country but becarful with The size
not as good as expected and where small
Tight in the toe area, unable to use for running  Toe area tight, not sure if they will break in after a while, but they cause my toes to bunch slightly, but they are fine otherwise. Disappointing.
Very disappointed.  I always wanted one of these shoes but found them to be too expensive. Finally decided to take the leap of faith and purchase for a trip to the Caribbean. All was well for beach walks, however  it has already started to fall apart after only one waterfall hike. Very very very disappointed. I bought some cheaper water shoes for my wife and kids at Wal-Mart and they has survived just fine. Of course they are all laughing at me know. I gave 2 stars for the fit and the fact that they kept out the same and worked well on slippery rocks.
Lasted only 8 months of regular use versus my Nimbus 11s, which I have worn since September 2010.  The saying, "you get what you pay for" couldn't be any more true when it comes to these shoes. I thought I was saving money when I got a pair of these instead of my previous, more expensive ASICS (Nimbus 11), but, alas, I was wrong.  I started wearing this pair in January 2015 and just a couple of months ago, noticed two holes developing on the top/front of the shoes. The holes have started to get bigger and the shoes seems to be falling apart from regular use. I understand that these shoes are about 60% less than my other ASICS, but I find it unacceptable that those shoes (Nimbus 11s) lasted more than 5 years of regular use while this pair is falling apart with only 8 months of use. I should also had that I used the Nimbus for running and long walks, while these shoes are mainly for work, worn on a carpeted office floor.  I will contact Amazon and ASICS regarding this matter and will update this review as to how the issue is resolved. As it stands now, the quality of these shoes have really turned me off from buying another pair of ASICS. The shoes are comfortable but I just don't want to keep buying a new pair every 6-8 months.
Small
Defective Shoes-Do not buy!  I ordered these shoes for my husband and when they arrived they had silver spots all over the shoes base. I returned them thinkng it was just that pair. The second pair arrived and they were worse than the first pair. Do not order these shoes unless you don't mind silver splatters all over them.
rubbish  very uncomfortable!
Comfortable.
Disappointed!  Have been running in this shoe for 25 years.  It was a great shoe for big men.  This one looked and felt cheaply constructed from poor quality materials.  The second time I wore them a hole appeared! Very sad!  This pair was like a cheap knock off!  Returned them!
i had some nike darts that i love so i thought these would be the same  i got these because they were for a neutral stride since i walk on the outside of my feet. i had some nike darts that i love so i thought these would be the same. they are for the most part, they keep me walking normally but they are slowly killing my feet. they don't seem to be too tight anywhere but my toes are killing me. i wear them for an hour or so in the morning, mostly to walk my dog, and when i am able to take them off, the pain starts and lasts through the day. i'm stuck with these now, so goodbye foot comfort.
I guess I won't be able to try UA shoes  These were supposed to be 4E, which is extra wide. They weren't even close. I had to return them.
Bad replacement  Have been using 2002 for five years. Decided to try 1540 and it was a big mistake. Once your feet gets used to 2002, don't even think about trying 1540. It's construction is totally different and the width of the outsole is so out of alignment that feet started hurting on the first day of running. Went back to 2002 and will now try 2040. I hope that can replace 2002 with better results ,if that's possible.
Not for running if you run  Size was fine but if you run and are used to wave riders these are not running sneakers.  From the first mile to the 6th my feet especially the balls of my feet we're on fire.  I have run in wave rider models (16-18) for years, many many pairs and they treated me right.  These are not made for running.  They are very cool looking though but I ordered another pair of wave riders for running and these will be causal sneakers
looks great but not the most comfortable  Shoe looks great but they are not the most comfortable. Not sure if it reebok in general or just this style because my first pair of reebok (zigtech) felt so comfortable .
yet a bit short - also did not like the memory foam insole - had to  too wide, yet a bit short - also did not like the memory foam insole - had to return
This shoe has very low quality and will not last you longer than two months if you expect to do more than walk lightly in them.
Returned them because they were very uncomfortable and I could not wear them.
made too small.
Not the right fit.  returned product after trying on for less than 5 minutes.  Fabric too thin, would not accommodate orthotic inserts.
Scam
The shoes arrived after four days after being advertised as Prime two day delivery.  Right after unboxing I went on a mile and a half walk and I noticed that one of the shoes were lower than the other like one of my legs were shorter than the other resulting in a strain and pain, swelling in the ankle and Achilles tendon area. I promptly returned them for a refund.
size wise it was good fit.  size wise it was good fit...but it hurts the toes area when you walk or run...may be my delivery had this issue.
I ran 3 miles and the rubber already wore through 33% on the inside knob. This is my third pair doing the same. Rubber too soft. You would think I would learn, but these were a gift.
I wear a 9.5 shoe ,the pair was re-ordered to 10.5 size and they are to small. Bill Hardin 954-812-4985
The shoe is good but the size is too small  The shoe is good but the size is too small. I returned the shoes for a refund. I advise ordering a .5 size larger than your usual size if you buy these shoes from this site.
although a comfortable shoe.  After only two times wearing, the tongue came off of the shoe.  Poorly sewn together, although a comfortable shoe.
Shoes were too small  I've been buying size 11 shoes for over ten years, thi is the first time the shoes have an 11 label and they were size 10 1/2.
Cheap foam shoes. Make a squeak noise with every step. Feet hurt badly after a day at the office. No support from the outer sole, insoles they come with do nothing to help. This is a 20.00 shoe for 100.00. I always buy Nike, but I guess nowadays 200.00 is the entry point for quality with this brand.
Garbage  Disk for tightening fell off right out of the box revealing a screw...cheaply put together..beware, folks!
The most uncomfortable running shoe ever. The top half of the show is to tight and the sole of the shoe is every hard.
Runs a full size small!  Even ordering this shoe a half size larger than I normally wear, it is STILL too small. They are being returned.
Worst running shoe ever  I've worn these shoes for a couple of weeks now and I've only gotten shin splints from them. I don't even want to run when I'm wearing them. I had to go out and buy a pair of running shoes that actually work. Yeah they look nice but if you're an actual runner then don't get these shoes!!!
Too Small  Advice offered is to order a little large. I ordered a 1/2 size larger than normal and they were still too small. How hard can it be to make shoes the right size? Otherwise I have no opinion, couldn't wear them.
Very disappointed.  I won't be ordering shoes online anymore.  I have bought shoes online for years and this is the first (and last) time I received a shoe marked with my size and double checked against the online fitting charts and still was probably a full two sizes too small.  Makes no sense to me but so it goes.  Live and learn.
not for me
Shoes coming apart!  I love this design and color! But my shoes are coming apart!
did not fit son at all.  size indicator not even close to the correct size. sent right back.
Been running on Reebok minimalist shoes for the past 6 years and I finally decided to change it uP.  Out of the box these shoes were awesome, however after 1 month of running on the gravel Motorpool they fell apart.  Rocks punctured straight through.  And the soles started falling off.  Overall maybe a good street shoe, but for trails or if you are in the military deployed with limited area to run I would not reccomend.
TR9 must be Saucony's Codename for 'Crap'  I've been a Saucony wearer for almost my entire life and I've always loved the Excursion Trail Runner line, it has been my go-to shoe for several years now so when after about 500 miles my TR8s started wearing out it was natural for me to jump on Amazon and pick up a pair of TR9s as their replacement.  When I took the shoes out of the box I immediately noticed how much 'cheaper' they felt than the TR8s, stiffer more plasticy soles, lower quality stitching but I figured it may just be 'weight reduction' materials so I tried to give them a chance...  I shouldn't have.  These are the single worst pair of shoes I've ever had, I have a hard time believing that these are Saucony!  After 5-10 miles my feet, calves, and even ankles are in so much pain that I have to abandon what I'm doing and head for home.  This is a staggering contrast to my old TR8s which would take 10 miles and ask for more.  These shoes feel, look, and wear cheap, merely a month and a half into ownership of the TR9s they've already been relegated to the 'Shoe Pile' in my house with the other worn out shoes I have and I was forced to go out and buy a new pair of shoes which, thanks to these TR9s, are my first pair of Non-Saucony shoes in my adult life.  Steer WAY clear of the TR9 generation, if you're looking at the Excursions try to find yourself a pair of TR8s as they are CONSIDERABLY better put together, wear better, and will overall serve you better for a lot longer than this cheap crap they are trying to pass off as an improvement.
Built in pebble  I tried these shoes because of the price and ease of purchase. For whatever reason my feet don't feel the support I usually feel in other running shoes. The left shoe feels as if there is pebble under my big toe which turned out to be the pattern of the shoe poking through the insert..
I do not have that wide of a foot and these fit pretty poorly.  Very tight fitting and narrow. I do not have that wide of a foot and these fit pretty poorly.
Take an inch or half inch bigger than your regular size  I'm a asics fan and in particular I like gel nimbus collection. But for some reason I started experiencing sheen splints with this version 17 shoes. I just have 10-15miles on them and I already feeling the pain. Nimbus-16 is best and far more superior than Nimbus-17. I have more than 100-125 miles on it and still going good.  Also, I usually take size 10 shoes. Due bad or new design, Nimbus-17 size 10 shoes feel like an inch shorter. As a result, I have my fingers squeezed and shoe material rubs against your skin even on socks.  Overall, Its a bad buy.
Width is incorrect  Purchased 4Es and they are more like 2Es.  Way too tight.
They look nice, but very uncunfurtable.
really good. Despite their good looks  I have never gotten so many compliments on a pair of sneakers. The  Indigo Blue/Hot Orange/Black color combination looks really, really good. Despite their good looks, there are some problems with this shoe. I love Asics for the most part (they make the best tennis shoes I have ever used)  but this brand can be very inconsistent in sizing and toe box design. After a couple of months of wearing these about 1x/week, my feet would start to hurt and feel really, really fatigued after less than an hour. Mind you, I don't use these for running or exercise. I bought a pair of Sof Sole Athlete shoe inserts which have worked in the past to make a pair of sneakers feel new. Didn't work with these. As nice as these look, I won't be getting them again.
makes it feel like your on ice  Why are these shoes so slippery, if u get water on them watch out, makes it feel like your on ice
Fit was too small with & without the insert.  I ordered a size 10. I do not have wide feet so I didn't order the wider size. The shoes were really tight especially with the foam insert.
not durable  ok walking shoe.  For running, made my legs hurt with impact. not as cushioned as id like. these shoes are not durable either. after a few months, the seams start to become undone with road running.  i switched to hoka vanquish. much better and no leg pain.
never got this shoe  so I can't review it they said they were all out of my size
I always wear 9 but these are way too tight
Hard to return since there was no return label.  I have to suffer the loss
Dissapointed with quality  I own several pairs of New Balance shoes and generally luke them however I have been disappointed with this pair. Some of the tread is coming apart on thr bottom of the shoe. I don't use these to run much more for walking.
This is horrible! Cut my heel within 5 minutes of walking.
Regret buying these shoes  This shoe is very light and the foam bottom creates good bounce as you step. However, my feet get very very hot while wearing it. The shoelaces it comes with are very very long. The foam sole wears down very very quickly. I would not buy these again
horrible running shoes  horrible running shoes, def not worth the time!  I ended up in so much pain using these to train in the begininging...don't skimp, get real running shoes!
Hope others had better luck in sizing,than i did  I wear size 11 shoes and boots. I tried to put left foot in could barley get shoe on my foot. Had it on less than a minute , Put it rite back in box for return. Also please note that both shoes were laced rite out of box so apparently someone else had same problem. I thought they were supposed to be NEW????
Must know foot type  I returned these shoes because after a week I noticed I was having knee pain and the bottom of my foot would hurt. I believe these sneakers were not as cushioned as I needed them to be. They were supportive, held my foot in place, but in the end they were just to stiff.
Too large
Not good for Jack.
Too small and tight, not enough support at the heel.
I've had the 1260V4 and 1260V5 and they fit perfectly.  Size 10 4E's and they were supremely comfortable.  I typically replace my sneakers every 6-9 months and it was time.  I ordered my normal size and they were too big.  I returned them and ordered a 9.5 4E which were also too big.  I tried one more time, ordering the 9's and you guessed it, they were too small.  Incredibly disappointed as they seemed super comfortable; wish the fit was as before.
2 Pairs of 11.5 US slightly different fit - One pair returned as too small (short)  These relatively expensive shoes should have better quality control than existing. One pair was fine, the other too tight.  Much hassle to return one pair: boxing, delivery to UPS etc.
Not made for big guys  Despite the sizing guide the ASICS brand seems to be catered to narrower feet.  The build quality seems fine but if you're a tall/big guy this probably won't fit well.
Horrible...  These were horrible....creased and filthy!! Very clearly used. For the price, they should have been new. So disappointed.
poor materials, poor workmanship  Wore out in three months, poor materials, poor workmanship,  cheap shoe.
Kind of pricey  Amazon is selling this shoe for $89.  I got it for $65, a season special.  The shoes are okay but they're very basic shoes... I think I overpaid.  There's no extra fabric over the big toe area so we'll see how long they last before they develop a hole there.  They're about a 1/2 inch longer than the brooks running shoes that I normally wear.  Addition:  After wearing these shoes for a short while, I threw them away.  Sizable rocks kept getting stuck in the soles and the shoes didn't provide much support at all.  I'd say the design is quite poor and wouldn't purchase any shoes that had this type of sole pattern again.
Not like other New Balance running shoes  Had to size up a whole size from my normal 10 to 11. Seemed very light and knowing NB shoes I figured they would be comfortable. Wrong. I'm throwing them away after trying them several times for casual wear, walking and running. I've run about 25 total miles in them and walked about the same. There is very little support or cushion. Feels like running in a dress shoe.
Way too small and no cushioning as advertised.  Cant remove the insole to put in a custom insole.  Had to send back.
Wrong product  Good looking shoes, but received two shoes for left foot.
ASICS mens running shoe  They were a narrow 4E and they were to tight. If they were wider I would have kept them, I liked the sneakers.
Bad seller----Sole Place  This shoes have odd size. #9 is smaller the regular size of #8. The seller, Sole Place does return the small shoes even the shoes are brand new and never touched ground. Do not buy the shoes from Sole Place.
Narrow toebox  These gave me a neuroma on my left foot. They have a slightly more narrow toe box than previous TR Saucony shoes. I had the TR7 and TR8 with no issues.
DISAPPOINTED!!!  I was sorely disappointed with the Kahana 7.  The product does not have enough cushion around the heal and ankles.  It does not feel balanced when I simply stand, too elevated on the forward portion of the shoe.  I have bought a substantial amount of the Kahana 6 for myself and loved ones. Asics should go back to the drawing board and look at the Kahana 6 for inspiration.  Thanks.
Nice shoes - Poor warranty honoring  I'm torn on these shoes which I purchased from another site.  As with my other Salomon shoes, I like the fit of the shoes and the sole and the support.  However, after wearing these shoes fewer than 2 dozen times and mainly indoors, the quicklace system broke.  The plastic lock crumbled in my hands.  Salomon shoes are sold with a written 2 year warranty for the entire shoe.  However, Salomon customer service says that regardless of what their written warranty says, in practice Salomon does not warranty any part of the lacing system.  If the lacing system breaks on these shoes, you'll need to purchase a new lacing system - which is different from the system that comes with these shoes.  In the end, I like the shoes, but the difference between Salomon's written warranty and their warranty practice has left a bad taste in my mouth.
Change not good
Not what I expected  Ive had these for some time now and the quality was not what I expected from NB. Probably won't buy NB agave n in the near future. Im really kinda bummed that theyve started making such cheep products
After use 3 times something inside starting to unstick
Terrible durability and comfort  The durability and comfort of these shoes is terrible. After only a couple months or less, large rips formed on the ball side of the foot. Shoes now look terrible and already need to be replaced.
too small  Its too small , i am size 11 and i ordered this in 11 and it was too small,, but it feels a little comfortable if it weren't too small
We've had better luck with past Asics  Fit well, but soles are coming apart after less than 2 months.  We've had better luck with past Asics, but these are not so good.
If it's not too small, it's at least somewhat small...  Everything else seems fine. But the size is obviously inconsistent between this leather version and the cloth version. You should for 9.5 if you are used to size 9 of the cloth version.
Falling apart  I thought these shoes were great, initially.  I had 1 good 5 mile run in them and it felt great, but after 2 or 3 uses, the shoes are already coming apart.  The "stripes" on the front of the shoe are glued on and on one shoe it's remained glued, but the other one it's already coming off. I recently developed some tendonitis in my achilles tendon.  So, I purchased these because of the split design in the ankle, which actually helped, but if the shoe starts to fall apart after a couple of runs, it doesn't seem like  a quality product.
poor quality, this shoes are very ONE
while comfortable, didn't last  This product, while comfortable, didn't last.  I started wearing them, and the fit was fine, however after six months the gel insoles were completely gone in some areas.  The sole and outside materials were fine, but that was it.  Pure junk
Not sized correctly  I wear 11 in every sneaker and shoe i own and these at size 11 wasn't even close more like size10.
I'm not sure if they are the original ones.
Too Small !!!
Sure are not 2160's  I had 2 pairs of 2160's that I ran 3 marathons in and loved them.  These have caused blisters on the insides of both heals after no more than 5 miles.  Sure do love paying close to $100 to find out that a shoe has changed. /s
No where as nice as the previous 1123 model  No where as nice as the previous 1123 model, very disappointed in New Balance for releasing a shoe that is nowhere as comfortable as the previous model. Wouldn't buy these shoes again.
These shoes last less than 3 months  I did like these in the beginning, great support for my feet and the pain in my heels immediately disappeared as I put these on. However, these shoes don't last at all!! It's been less than 3 months and they are already soft and the support is totally gone. I don't even run and the lifespan of these shoes is simply ridiculous. To make sure it was not just my impression, I bought a brand new pair and compared them. Difference between a 3-month old shoe and a brand new one is HUGE. I'm extremely disappointed.
Ehhhh....  The backs of the shoes are not rigid like other shoes.  So, if you don't run in them, they pinch the backs of your heels.  Hard to explain, but I wouldn't buy this particular pair of shoes again.
asics mens GT 1000 @ running shoe  Asics originally were made in China.  They are now made in Viet Nam, and they do not fit the same.  They are at least 1/2 size smaller than the one from China.  The main complaint is the area that goes across your toes fits to low/tight and they just are not comfortable at all.  on closer inspection I found there is glue in the right shoe that rubs against my toes...I've tried everthing I know  to remove the glue to no avail.
Not very well made..  I got this as I'm a fan of many ASIC products, but as the saying goes..you get what you pay for.  To get to the chase.  The adhesion of the sole to the urethane membrane is weak and after about a month (and I just wear these around the town) it will peel off.  Particularly for me it has been the left outside footbed area and the left heel.  For serious running I would stay away from these.
NO STAR REVIEW.  WONT LET ME POST LESS THAN THE 1 FOR THESE 0 STAR SHOES  Received these on Feb 19, 2016, and today is April 11, 2016 and the soft bottoms are completely worn out.  126.4 mostly inside walking miles on them, a little over 1 1/2 months.  My advice to anyone considering these is keep scrolling.  The soft bottom is nice for about a month, then it starts to degrade at an alarming rate.  Really disappointed that these were labeled as runners.  Misleading is what it is.  Surprised to find amazon has 1 month warranty on these.  TERRIBLE!!
No good for wide feet  I bought these shoes because I read so many reviews saying they were really wide, and I have super wide feet. Well, the 6Es I bought wound up narrower than my 4E Asics and even my 2E Skechers. These shoes are not nearly as wide as they claim to be. They scraped huge, nasty holes in the inside and outside of my foot. If you have giant, square feet like I do, these are not the solution.
very light weight, fit well, but not that supportive  I found these shoes unsupportive.  They fit well and were very comfortable.  They are unbelievably light weight.  But I could not imagine running in them for long.  There was no ;lateral support and they felt unstable to me.
Too tight  front foot area is tighter than last pair.  may need to return due to back hurting after first wear.  bought 4E width but does not seem to matter.
Un-Happy  No support at all for a new balance product I was disappointed
too small, mostly not wide enough  pls send out the next size up and I'll return one.  thank you,  Jim Redington
SOLE WEARS OUT FAST  I really liked these hiking shoes with one major exception, the sole material is too soft. I bought them at REI so of course I paid more so that factors into my low star rating. I only hiked in them for less than 20 miles on  trails with a moderate incline . The surface was rocky and somewhat muddy in places. The lugs of the heals on the shoes had worn down by 75% . I had only owned them for about a month when I noticed that. There are some people that might not mind replacing these shoes with such a short lifespan  at the price I paid. For those people I would say they're a great shoe for comfort, and traction, but I find them unaffordable for the short life I got out of them. So I'm going to try a different shoe with hopefully a more durable sole. When I returned them to REI they told me there intended for soft soil trails only.
Shoes have a lump in their sole.  Not impressed.
VERY DISAPPOINTED.  This shoe was supposed to replace the classic (and now discontinued) Montrail Sabino.  It does a miserable job.  Very disappointed.  Mesh is nice, but shoe is WAY TOO NARROW.  Had to return the shoes.  I hope Montrail steps up and produces a true replacement for the Sabino.  If/when they do, I'll be purchasing half a dozen to stock up...
Too Small  I'm a size 15 and bougth a size 15 of this shoes but this shoes is to small for me. is more small than the specification of the company, I will search some body to give this shoes because i don;;t know what to do with them.
Order 1/2 size larger and beware of the width  Normally wear an 11 in Saucony and Asics but an 11 in this shoe is maybe even a bit more than a 1/2 size too small in length. I have a C width foot and these surprisingly felt snug across the toe box.  Heel counter fit well, and good mid arch side support. Material construction was up to standards of my other shoes so I may reorder in a half size larger.
Memory foam inside heel area split apart.
So wanted to love this shoe.  Ventured out to try a different brand from my normal trail shoe.  Love the styling of this sneaker, but did not fit my foot well.  Too much room in the heel and when laced for a snug heel, the laces pinched over the bridge too much.  I don't think stepping down a half-size will solve the problem.  Will be returning and going back to New Balance.
too stiff
Poor quality  The soles fell apart in three months.
Cheaply made.  I liked the shorts until I washed them the first time and a thread pulled and a line is unraveling. I guess you get what you pay for - cheap price, cheap product.
try on before buying  Shoes are way to big and arch support is not good... its a weird shape, try them on before buying
I somehow managed to purchase the wrong size (US8 rather than US9), may be because I was switching from UK to US sites while looking to buy. Nothing wrong with the runners themselves just the size.
IT WAS NVER MENTIONED THAT TESE SHOES WERE SO NARRROW
Don't buy it.  I work for a multinational shipping company and I am constantly walking fast and slow during the day for 12 hours. Well, I thought I was buying a great quality shoe but both shoes ripped from the sides and one lence just snapped. Keep in mind that I do not run but puma says that this shoe is manufactured for running which I found quite disturbing. In conclusion, if you buy it hopefully you don't go through what I went to. I'm buying reebok and I am not coming back to puma.
Foot pain!  Compared to previous Kayano versions, the 23 seems to be terribly uncomfortable. I've never had any issues with foot pain using 17 through 21, but with these 23s, my feet routinely ache a couple miles into a run. I'm about ready to toss them into the garbage because after using them for about 30+ miles, it hasn't gotten better. I'll keep trying to find pairs of 21s or earlier if I can.
Do not buy a size up if you run 1/2 size  My actual size is 9.5 so if you have widefeet a size up does not help.
Odd sizing  I ordered a pair of MT20v2 in 10.5d but there was 2.5" of space in the toe box between my biggest toe and the front of the shoe.  I sent them back and ordered a half size smaller in wide.  These also were too long in the toe box by 2.5" so I'm sending those back as well and I'm done with ordering this model shoe.  I agree with the customer who compared the feel of these to clown shoes.  Love New Balance minimus, just not this one.
poorly constructed  I've been running in these shoes for around 6 months and long before the soles began to show any wear the sides began to crack and tear. I am not particularly hard on shoes and typically my shoes last two years or more. I would not buy these shoes again. I expect my shoes to last longer than 6 months when I am running only 15 miles a week.
Not wide enough.
too narrow for the regular size  I was excited about the shoes, but they are too narrow... going back as they won't exchange because of the price difference now.
too small  i have been purchasing the same size of new balance shoes for years without a problem..always consistent sizing.  these shoes were way too small and narrow, leading me to believe they may not really be made by new balance.  I will be returning them
Fits larger and its not as comfortable as the vomero 12. I do not recommend the 13.
Gives Pain in Legs during long drives  Not good for Driving gives lot of Pain in Leg
Hard Insoles  I was excited about the low price on these newbies and the overwhelmingly positive reviews here, everyone seems to like them but I don't. The fit seemed fine, they were very light, but the insole was was rock hard. I prefer my shoes to have a lot more give and I wasn't going to bother putting softer insoles in them when I could just find a shoe that better suited my needs.
Nike  Too big. Need 12.5 size
This shoe is great if you have a narrow foot.  I have never had to buy a "wide", when I buy shoes... but this shoe in my size is way too narrow in the bridge/arch section, length wise it was good.  Over all this shoe fit very awkwardly, almost clown shoe like, too wide/roomy in the toe with a narrow arch.  it does look good and is very very light, if it fit like it should then you would not be able to tell you are wearing anything if that makes sense.  I wish it fit me, it is a nice shoe.
... will preface this review by saying that I really like New Balance in general  I will preface this review by saying that I really like New Balance in general. While this shoe fit very well and works for running, it started falling apart within two weeks of purchase and continues to deteriorate quickly. Perhaps, I got a lemon, but I definitely will not be buying this model in the future. I hope this is not sign that New Balance is going down hill generally in quality.
Lacks cushion and quality  While I have bought many of this specific type of shoe in the past, this particular one had shoddy quality as its cushioning feels like it is non existant.  Additionally, the back heel has been causing blisters, even 60+ miles into use which is far beyond what I would consider a normal break in period.  On top of that, I've never had a single blister from prior Cohesion shoe purchases.
Great look, but poor comfort and durability.  I loved the web look and I remember loving Puma's when I was younger. These were not like those Puma's. I brought them on a trip where I expected to do a lot of walking and they became incredibly uncomfortable after the first couple of days. And I usually walk quite a bit so it wasn't that I was just uncomfortable. A few months down the line and the webbing along the sides started to crack and tear. Now the heavy plastic webbing around the heel has started to crack and it squeaks when I walk. I decided to go back to my go-to brand and just finished placing the order. Now I can't wait to get rid of these shoes.
Smallest size 11 I have ever bought.
My feet are NOT getting that much bigger-NB is using different lasts!  In a Drew shoe and PREVIOUSLY in a NB shoe an 114E (SL2 last with NB) was fine.  Ok, so maybe as I aged I'm in need of an 111/2 but there just isn't ant toe room in these.  Trying a 12 but when will NB wise up and bring back old reliable 1123!!
I've been wearing the same size in New Balance shoes for over 10 years, of all different styles (running shoes, trail shoes, and walking shoes). These shoes are sized differently though; they're too narrow, and too short.
Too narrow  They arrived today. I got the same size exactly as previous pairs I've worn. They felt narrow and I thought " Maybe they just need to break in a bit" , but I remembered reading a few reviews  about them being weirdly narrow. I broke out a tape measure and measured them and found the toe box width is one quarter inch more narrow than the old pair. Do not buy these.
He did not like them at all  I ordered these shoes for my 12 year old grandson. He did not like them at all. They were to heavy and he did not like the style.
way too small
Quality is terrible  Don't last long. Make you look ridiculous. Is this look over? No? Come get me when it is.
poor fit
falling apart after only a few wears  After only a few times wearing these shoes, the bottom is peeling.
The shoe was too narrow... (Service was Great!!!)  I realized that I need a much wider shoe. I sent them back for a refund...
Too tight...  Wore last edition with no problem. This edition fits much tighter than previous. Will try returning soon
Rather disappointing...  If you're looking for a nice looking shoe that's light in weight this is an optional. I honestly bought it for my daily jogging, it looks lovely and very light. The sad part is that I wore it only for for 75 minute walk and it hurt my feet like hell! it was very uncomfortable and gave me sores. It was truly disappointing as I was expecting it to be as comfortable as it looks. I still wear this shoe around the house or anywhere that doesn't include long walks.
The width is not like any 4E I've owned but still a nice shoe
Low quality product.  No refund or customer service available  Falling apart after less than 4 months with minimal wear
Too Small  Normally wear a 10E so having never purchased a pair of New Balance shoes before was worried the 10 EE would be too big. Turns out they were way too small. Really narrow shoes. Returned them. Probably won't buy shoes online unless I have worn the brand name before. First time I ever had to return something. Amazons return program was extremely easy.
tight
Basket of Confusion  I've worn Birks for 15 years...I typically hover between 42M and 43M or 43N...(M is regular width, N is narrow)  I went to store and tried on 42M to replace my existing 42M.  They where short in length and very uncomfortable. I tried on 43M and they were good length but wide...I had socks on even and I was having to strap as far as I could strap  ( so without socks i would have had to create holes and cut off the tabs....and even then it was a little wide....)  I ordered 43N from Amazon to get the 43 length and a narrower footbed.  Amazon incorrectly shipped me a 43M (another poster indicated they had problems getting an N shipped..kept getting Ms instead.....seems amazon has the products inventoried incorrectly ).  I tried on the 43M expecting it to fit as the one in the store did and and instead of being wide...it was narrow...almost too narrow........without socks I was only on the 2nd hole....it fit much more like I'd have expected from a 43N..and maybe even narrower!?!?  I double checked and  the box and shoes were marked as 43M.....I have no clue if there is a 43M arizona and a 43M unisex arizona...but Ive never noticed so much emphasis on 'unisex' before...the box was marked with an Eva sole....dont know if that plays into anything here or not...I think that's the regular sole for Arizonas......  Something is a muck with both Amazons ability to process orders for N widths AND with Birkenstock's sizing in general, and  I believe this supports several other posts with the same/similar info.  if you can't find a store to try and buy first hand...be flexible with anything that gets shipped as it could turn out to be a process with illogical sizing inconsistencies and shipping errors with N widths especially.
I feel bad leaving this review as I love Brooks shoes and had a pair of glycerine 14s that were amazing but this shoe hurts to even walk in. I went on an 8 Mile run last week and pretty immediately felt pain in both ankles and shins. Ive been trying to walk around in them to see what the issue is and even walking hurts. Maybe they work well for smaller runners. Im 64 210lbs and I need a lot of ankle support. These shoes look great but thats about it for me anyway. My toes felt like they were touching cement on day 1. Going back to the Glycerine models.
Shoe was marked wrong or was a full size too small  the shoe said size 12 but was actually size 11.  I gave them to a co-worker and likely won't purchase again.
Even got them a half size to big. Still to small
Should have been so much better, even lacks a standard feature!  I really wanted to like these shoes but there are definitely a few things to be aware of before buying such an expensive shoe. 1) These shoes run narrow for the "D"-standard width rating, so my 4th & 5th toes scrunch up against each other. After 2 months, it hasn't loosened up yet. 2) This shoe has no Achilles flex notch, that dip at the top of the heel guard, hence some slight rubbing against the achilles when running. It's hard to believe a $100+ shoe doesn't have a flex notch--this is a standard feature on any running shoe! 3) For some reason my ankle socks end up getting pushed down into the shoe during runs. This doesn't happen with my Asics or Nikes. Not sure if it's the lack of a flex notch or what. 4) After about 50 miles, I no longer feel the extra cushioned landing that really impressed me when I first started running in them. Now they just feel like a decent pair of Nikes or Asics, except that I paid a premium for what in the end is a soft but ill-fitting, sub-standard shoe. You just don't expect all of this when paying so much for a shoe. I really hope HOKA looks into these issues.
not comfortable for walking/running  Feel like i am walking on cement.  I always liked asics shoes but this particular model is not comfortable at all.  I will buy ASICs again but not this one.
Faulty!!  Had them 2 weeks and already falling apart. I own several pairs of these shoes and never had an issue. Extremely disappointed
Great Shoes, Just not this pair.  The Puma Carson Runners are great. I think this (red camo - 01/2016) purchase was the 3rd pair of Carson Runners I've had. FYI these are comfort shoes similar to Nike Roshe One, Run. I also wear them to workout with a pair of spenco insoles which gives a little extra support. Without the insoles they are still okay for regular gym workouts, but not for running. So Carson Runners are great comfortable shoes. I gave a 2 star only for the condition of this particular pair of shoes. Upon opening the box they smelled extremely musty. Not a little musty, but extremely musty. There is no way the shipper could not have noticed it. I decided to keep the shoes and wash them. In hindsight that was a mistake as it took several washing along with baking soda to remove the odor. The shoes were shipped from Max and Maddy. So Puma Carson Runners are great, just watch who you get them from.
Did not like that the tongue of the shoe was attached it made my foot feel like it was suffocating I had know where move my feet
Only worn 2 months and have holes in the mesh
Cheaply Made  I have been buying only Saucony for about 15 years. They fit my foot better than any other shoe. These shoes were no exception.  Unfortately, one of the eyelets (the little pieces of fabric that holds the shoelaces) torn off about a month after I bought them. When I went online to return them, I found that the grace period to return them had expired by two days. I guess that's my fault because the eyelet was already failing a week earlier.  Maybe I just got a bad pair, but I am definately leary about the quality of these shoes now and am also not liley to buy shoes using Amazon again. The return policy (and complication of sending them back) just isn't worth it.  Too bad because it's so much easier to find Saucony on the web than in stores.
Five Stars  Best price on hard to find shoes. Up date. Poor quality. Lasted 4 months.
Air bag in one shoe flattened after 2 days despite no puncture
Ordered a half size larger (10.5) than my son's old spikes and they were hard for him to get on. Then ordered another pair (11.5) and they are still relatively small. The spikes are light and definitely cut small.
Nice shoe, but needs tweaking  Vinyl sides are rigid and irritates small toes. Soft mesh should go down further.
Needed a pair of gym shoes for my husband. He has been using them for awhile now and they are now making some weird noise when he walks. Thankfully we have a home gym or he wouldnt be using them
Shoes are small
Horrible Wrong shoe
Sized Wrong  I have a couple of pairs of these that I love.  I ordered the same size that I already own and the new ones are at least a size and a half smaller than the ones that I have even though they say they are the same size.
Looked good.. Hurt my feet  I bought these because my friend who was a runner always wore Saucony shoes. I liked the looks of them so I bought them.. I must say I am sorrily dissapointed with them. They made my feet hurt something fierce, and are nowhere near as comfortable as my asics have been. I recently bought a new pair of Asics and am pleased to say they are better for me. I must note that I don't have the narrowest feet, but I think that after wearing a shoe in for a month or so they should usually conform, I did not see this happen. The insoles shifted on me frequently and I just decided to be done with it...For my money I will always buy Asics in the future. I wear these only for going to the store etc.... I don't use these for running.
Look at the title, it says Kayen West! Lol
Was at least 1 size too small, my other new balance shoes fit properly
Very disappointed  The shoes have a decent fit with the exception of the heel being too low. Everytime I walk it feels like my foot is about to come out of the shoe which is very disappointing because usually the new balance shoes are very comfortable so Im unsure if I will be purchasing New Balance Shoes again.
Otherwise the pairs I received seem to look nice, though I was not thrilled on the packing  These shoes seem to run small.  I received two pair and both seemed a 1/2 size too small.  Otherwise the pairs I received seem to look nice, though I was not thrilled on the packing.  In short I need to return both pairs since the shoes are a bit small while other brands of the same size fit great.
I'm flat footed and it didn't work for me.  Looks great, but nowhere near as good as my Asics when it comes to support and stability.
i'm very disappointed with the shoes  i'm very disappointed with the shoes. the soles were unglued in only a few times my husband  wore them. I add a photo
Not a good quality like the other pair of shoes
Uppers torn after 4 mo moderate use running trails. Soles do not provide much cushioning on pavement.
It says these are men's shoes, but the ones I received were for women, which may explain why they were also too small.
Do not buy. Junk!!  Fit nice, looked good. Then i dared walk in them. I didn't even get an hour of use out of these before the air bladder started leaking out of both shoes. Every step you could hear air escaping
Not so impressive!  Not that impressive for the price. It became so worn quickly.
Shoe review  Very disppointed with this shoe as I have been a fan and loyal customer of Asics for several years. I felt ok for about 3 days on concrete floors that I work on. After this I could not stand the pain any longer. I tried Z-Coil shoes after this and was not disappointed. They have been wonderful to walk in, and I highly recommend them.
Stylish, but very disappointed.  Bought for the shock absorbing spring to cushion the heel of my feet.  It does not do that. There's no give in the heel. I would have been better off spending $20.00 on cushioned insoles.
Don't follow standard Nike sizing. I've got a size 12 in multiple Nike varieties, these are larger than all of them. Substantially larger.
Hate that we have to pay for shipping in exchanges  Too small.  Do not have time to ship back. Hate that we have to pay for shipping in exchanges.
Most Uncomfortable Shoe Ever!!  I am a very active 70 year old male that works out daily, decided to purchase these to use while riding my spinner as well as using my Bowflex Max Trainer. These shoes have got to be the cheapest, most uncomfortable shoe I have ever worn. Can't decide if I should as for a refund or just throw the shoes in the trash....they are so bad I would NOT donate them to Goodwill!!!!!
HORRIBLE!!! Size is WAY OFF!!  I had very high hopes for this shoe. But sizing is a huge issue. It runs EXTREMELY narrow!! Worse yet is for some reason, I can't return these. So I am stuck with a brand new pair of shoes that were made for someone with freakishly narrow feet. Shame on K-Swiss.
Too high and cushioned for running  Really unconfortable for running. The problem is its too high on the heels and too cushiony so you are constantly using more muscle to stabilize yourselves. These shoes cause me great pain in my legs when running and if they cant be used for running then a waste of money. I guess I need lower profile shoes and less cushioned.
WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN  I have always bought reebok shoes and loved them , these are not good the sole is starting to come off  after only 2 months , and there  not even worn every day , sometimes a couple hours at time , in the house or car only, I would not buy again, I don't know if these are knockoffs or what is wrong , I have reeboks that I have worn for years.
Fell apart within two months!!
Smaller than listed  This model runs smaller than every other pair of New Balance shoes I've purchased over the last 30 years.  I was able to return them, but was not able to replace as they were purchased on sale.
Disappointed  If you love the speed cross 3. Prepare to be disappointed
Quality not quite up to par.
Very Small, Not wide at all.  I ordered a 12 Wide because I wear a 12 Wide in every other brand of shoe, Nike, Skechers etc. These are really really small. Not only are they not wide, they are also very short. Putting these on my feet made me feel like the incredible hulk as he starts to turn green.
This shoes comes without OrthoLite insole. It is very hard in the heel area.
Wasted my time and money...plus pain.  I usually get size 12.5 if available or 13 if not. I ordered these shoes in 13 and they felt too small, but I thought it wouldn't be too bad. After, I went on my third hike and my feet hurt so bad every time, I decided to give up. What a waste of money...
I needed a bigger size
The color of the shoe is not the same as the photo.
Im 7,5 women!! I don't know what hapened!
I hate to say this  I hate to say this, because I normally love New Balance, but these are just too soft for me - too much cushioning.  It messed up my stride and made my knees really sore.  I would recommend the 1267 model instead, they have just the right amount of padding.
and their site recommended a 14 with that info  The shoefitr altra uses on their site is ridiculous. I have a 13 in their Torsin 1.5 shoe which fits, and their site recommended a 14 with that info. the 14 sz are clown shows, way too big.
I rated the shoe one star because the fit was both tight and short for the size.
Good, until . . .  Loved the shoes wore them almost everyday to break them in. After about a month I stopped and played a quick pick up game of basketball while wearing the shoes and felt some traction rip off as I was playing. I super glued the parts back on in hopes of saving them. Then about week later I used them to run a Spartan Beast. They handled the race well and I had traction and comfort, but after the race I noticed several other parts of the traction had tore from the soft foam of the shoe. This is very disappointing because I was planning to use then to run a Tough Mudder in 6 weeks. There is definitely a design flaw if you are using these shoes for anything besides running in a straight line.
The shoe cushions well.  However, the rubber sole inserts at the heel are detaching.......disappointing.
Terrible quality  After doing some research on which shoes should I use for Crossfit I found that the NB Minimus series were very good at it, so I chose these "Trail" version even though I just run in the street and make some crossfit training indoors, this includes carpet an cement most of the times. These were very useful shoes until the sole ripped off in less than one month of use and by one month I mean 3 days a week so that makes barely 24 hours of NOT trail use. I'm very disappointed and I'll give it a good thought before buying another NB shoes.
Too different from the 11's  I wear and really like the Alchemy 11's so I decided to order the 12's as a second pair.  The 12's are nothing like the 11's in that they run smaller in the length and width, and do not have the same cushioning.  I assume a larger size may have fixed the sizing differences however the 'hardness' of the soles were the deal breaker.  They were returned.
These suck! Get Inov-8 or Icebug instead.  Insoles rolled up under my toes after getting wet. Had to remove them after 3 miles and run the remaining 11 miles of the race without insoles. I'm not the only one, I see Salmon insoles littering ever race I do. Consumer service was no help, they simply told me to purchase alternate insoles which sould never be required for a new shoe. After using alternate insoles, the material split near both small toes. The lugs also tear off kind of quickly and it has really poor water drainage.
so now i'm with shoes sized 44 in an asian country where men do not have sizes like that. very disappointing as they seem to be  while it was posted as 11 (i.e. 45.3) it was probably 44 max - it was way too small, i could not return it as was ordering from abroad through a shipping company; so now i'm with shoes sized 44 in an asian country where men do not have sizes like that. very disappointing as they seem to be good shoes.
They're Great but too big  I ordered my regular size & they're huge! What makes it worse is that there's no printer in my area is I can't print out the return labels. I'm so dissapointed. I should've picked a smaller size.
Decent Shoes, Worst Customer Service Ever  I took Amazon's reviews seriously and decided to buy the KSOs direct off Vibram's website rather than off Amazon.  I used the sizing method according to the Vibram website and ordered a pair of 42 black KSO rush delivery.  I got the shoes, and they were grossly undersized.  In fact the size was so small my wife could wear them.  I returned the shoes the next day and ordered two sizes bigger than my recommended.  According to returns and exchanges on the Vibram website, it may take up to 7 business days to get another pair mailed back.  I didn't get my shoes mailed back until the day after I left a nasty message saying I wanted a refund if they were not going to ship.  This was 3 weeks after them receiving my shoes.  Customer service at Vibram NEVER answers.  You will have to leave a message.  Out of 6 messages, I recieved 2 call-backs. One actually left a message to which I returned their call and got another answering machine.  The website allows you to leave a short message of 100 characters.  After two months of no product, I finally got a pair that fit.  I have since used them for two weeks of running, hiking, and weight training.  These shoes work great with weight training, as lifting heavy dumbbells usually requires better balance.  This is something cross-trainers and running shoes don't provide, and can actually make you roll on your ankle due to the padding. For hiking, I could use them on the beginning parts of trails, but ended up switching to a shoe with more rugged protection when descending mountains.  For running, which is why most buy these for the "barefoot" experience, I can't recommend.  I'm an avid 20+ mile a week runner, and you simply cannot run high-mileage in these shoes.  What shoes provide is mid-strike support for your posterior tibial arch, which helps you increase your stride and decrease the fatigue time of your forefoot.  When wearing barefoot shoes like these, the posterior tibial is completely unprotected, along with heel padding.  This is why many people run much slower when starting out, because you're essentially running in a sprint position non-stop and your stride must decrease.  There is also absolutely no evidence which suggests barefoot running will increase your times.  Seriously, look it up, and you'll only find websites attempting to sell the barefoot experience rather than provide data.  If anything barefooting will slow you down considerably, and you're also at just as much risk for back injuries in the KSO shoes as you are with regular running shoes if your posture is incorrect.  The hype about these shoes is mostly by people who believe shoe companies like Nike and New Balance are evil corporations, and the only way to fight them is to buy zero padding rubber socks like Vibrams which cost just as much as a premium pair of shoes.  There is however something liberating about wearing a pair of "barefoot" shoes, and I enjoy them.  I'll definitely be wearing these for light running and weight training, though I'm looking at other companies which have better customer service for my next pair. Bad support Vibram.
Terrible for running on wet pavement  Terrible in the wet - there is so little contact area that when you walk in the wet your feet keep slipping
Didn't work out...  Too small. Had to return shoes and pay for the shipping. Lost money on this one.
They seem like they'd be comfortable but are way too tight around my foot.  returning.
The color is nice but nothing special about these shoes
WAY to small, had to be mislabled
It broke my feet knees and back after just walking. Awful shoes.
Falling apart after 2 weeks.  After 2 weeks the left shoe started to fall apart, simply from walking around, shoes usually will last me a full year before I they become uncomfortable, but this these became unwearable in a fortnight. I first thought it was a defect, so I return them and got the same pair, only for both shoes to begin to fall apart with 1 week. So unless you like getting new shoes every week, avoid these ones.
Terrible Fit!  Terrible fit, and ripped the flesh-off my achilles tendon on my left foot within the first few minutes of wearing it. Save your money.
tring to return
I love Solomon Running shoes. This shoe has a new tongue design that attaches the tongue to the floor of the shoe,  I love Solomon Running shoes, I own several pairs, recently I purchased two pair of the Salomon XA Pro 3D Trail Running Shoes - SS15 and the  Salomon XA Pro 3D Limited Edition Trail Running Shoes, what I do not like about these shoes is the new tongue design they have gone to.. the tongue is attached to expandable mesh on both side of the tongue, when you place your foot into the shoe the mesh and tongue seem to bunch up toward the front of the shoe, you have to pull on the tongue to clear up the bunch. After which you still feel the mesh on both sides of your foot. For me I didn't like either of these shoe so I sent them back. From now own I will stay with the Salomon XA Pro 3D GTX Trail Running Shoes, the Salomon XA Pro 3D AW15 Trail Running Shoes, or the Ultra 2 WP
Asics losing ground  asics seems to be getting overall worse. The last 2 pair I purchased r not comfortable n seem less quality
Were not sized right.  Top of box torn off then there was a plastic bag in there.  I sent back because I truly believe they were not real Nike shoes.  The were so missized.
I think these are men's shoes. About a size too large. in fact the box had a previous sticker that said men's on it.
Not as cushioned as I had expected and the leather bump over the toe hit my toe.  They did not have as much cushion under the ball of the foot as I had hoped. I bought them to use at the gym, weight lifting and walking on the treadmill on an incline.  The toe also has a little piece of leather that is on top, over the mesh, and my toe hit it, because my toes lift when I walk.
Functions like a slipper and should be worn as such  This shoe offers little to no stability or support.  The design of the heel is shallow and does not hold your heel or your foot in place.  No matter how tight I tie these shoes my foot is all over the place.  I would not recommend these for anything than a slow saunter over flat ground.  I find that my crocs offer more stability, support, and security
Way too small! Bought my size the first time and it was too small. Returned and got the next bigger size. Still too small!! Decided buying shoes on line was not so smart! I love the New Balance brand and went to a local specialty store and got fitted and ended up with a great pair of shoes!!
not like the standard luarglide  the mesh sucked on my feet, cutting off the blood to my toes. aside from that this shoe was so bad for my ankle i cant tell you how foolish i feel for trying this marshmello with laces.
Asics makes a wide fit that is much more comfortable.  For a wide fit it really isn't wide. And because the sole is more narrow than the shoe I feel a little unstable. Asics makes a wide fit that is much more comfortable.
Luckily I ordered another style and they fit great!  I have worn New Balance for years.  Unfortunately this shoe style, although a 4E, did run narrow for my feet.  They were too uncomfortable for me to wear at all.  Luckily I ordered another style and they fit great!
Poor Quality  Started making weird noises just a couple days in. Inexcusable for $75 dollar shoes. Already looking for replacements.
If you buy these. Buy a big bottle of super glue. And it won't make any difference. I paid $130 not $70 and a card. Full refund.  I purchased the hokas because my Orthopedic surgeon specifically recommended them. Turns out she didn't have a clue what she was talking about. She knew how to get my insurance company to give her $26000 to ruin my foot though. They were very comfortable ...however for $130.00 I shouldn't have had to super glue any part of the shoe. The shoes were defective. I had them for less than 3 months. Full refund is what needs to happen. There is no way you haven't received those shoes. I followed the policy to the letter. Do the right thing. Come on. This is ridiculous that this hasn't been handled days ago.
too narrow  not the quality they used to make
Shoes wear out in 90 days  I like the shoe, it is light weight and comfortable. the problem is that my big toe has already worn a hole in the uppers of the left shoe. The material seems to be very weak on the upper sides of the shoe.
Based upon reviews, I bought a half size larges and one size wider but the shoes still are tight particularly across the top of the foot. If they don't loosen up soon I won't be able to wear them more that a half day at a time.
BUY THE 16s AND WAIT FOR THE 18s  I've worn the Nimbus models now for a long time. I must admit I like the 16 better than the 17. The 17 "shed some serious weight" according to Asic's description by getting rid of some of the plastic structure around the instep and toe box. Basically the the shoe is now one piece of lightweight fabric on top of a cushy sole. This might sound great, but for those who log in serious running time, this results in loss of shoe shape and rapid stretching. I have worn my new 17's for all of about 30 miles, and they now feel like they are half a size too big--both width and length. I really hope the 18's fix this.....otherwise I will be stockpiling on 16's.
I've had Samba's in the past.  These were overly tight and narrow.
Sole separates shortly after purchase.  Portions of the sole started separating only two months after purchase.  Of course it's outside Amazon's return window, so I'm stuck trying to either repair these or buy another pair.
Shrunken shoe size no longer fits!!  For some reason beyond my grasp, Nike has apparently made all of their newer shoes narrower than their earlier versions.  This makes it difficult for previous Nike fans to order a newer shoe in an appropriate size.  A slightly wider shoe (2E instead of D)-(from another seller, since I didn't see a wider version on Amazon) fit perfectly and was very comfortable.  Long time Nike fans would probably be better served by ordering a slightly wider shoe than they previously liked when they order a newer model.  Incidentally, although "free returns" were advertised when I ordered, the actual provider tried to impose a substantial RESTOCK (RIPOFF) fee for my return, in addition to requiring me to pay the postage for the return.
First day found holes in them  Save your money. Found a hole in them on the first wear.
Comfortable but not durable  Horrible. Soles are coming apart on both shoes after less than 3 months. Contacted Reebok and they never replied. Shoes are comfortable but do not hold up to just casual wear.
After 3 months holes formed in both shoes  Shoes,fit great and look nice. However after only 3 months they formed holes in the mesh on both shoes . I guess it is,design flaw
... item the box was destroyed and the shoes looked like they been used before  When I received this item the box was destroyed and the shoes looked like they been used before.
2 stars for my Flintstone Feet brethren  I feel bad giving these 2 stars because they are really good shoes that I'm sure someone else will really like. But they're just too narrow. I have flat feet ("Flintstone feet") and require very wide shoes. I ordered the 4E (extra wide) ones, and that just wasn't enough. Even 2E (wide) is normally enough for me with some brands (I have a pair of Sketchers that are 2E that fit great). So I don't think it's unreasonable for me to expect 4E to fit properly; if anything it should have been too wide, but instead it was too narrow.  Since I'm unable to adequately measure comfort and the actual experience of wearing the shoes, I'm stuck relying on the normal stuff you'd evaluate prior to trying on a shoe. It bends at the toes, not at the arch. The mesh outside means they provide excellent airflow, which is great for people who get sweaty feet (e.g., runners). The shoe has a great aesthetic; many ASICS shoes are very gaudy, but I like these; they're boring and black, just how I like it.  If you don't have wide feet, they seem like they'd be excellent shoes.
Not comfortable at all  After two weeks of wearing this show my right heel hurts. These shoes weren't what I thought they would be. Not comfortable at all. Won't buys these again.
Way too small
my socks were full of blood and I haven't worn them and I don't recommend them for  Two small the  low cut in the back  of the sneaker . kept cutting into my heels .my socks were full of blood and I haven't worn them  and I don't recommend them for running
very small to de size  the shoe is very good but in my case I stay or do I have very narrow feet and the rather thick this type of shoe is something fine in any case if you have a slim foot shoe will fare very well. I do not have it served by foot thick something which has not happened to me with other models of the same make or brand
Toes popping through top of shoe - again!  My husband bought the same sneaker last year and noticed that his toes were popping through the top.  He thought maybe it was just that pair and bought another.  Within 2 months of wearing these - the same thing happened.  Our entire family has worn New Balance for at least 20 years and it is very sad that the quality has decreased so much.  (I had the same exact problem on my shoes as well).
my grandson was very pleased
I'm size 9 but this shoes it's too small 4 me!!
Hoka One One Cliftons  They are made for people who supponate when they run, WHICH I DO NOT DO and consequently have minorly rolled both ankles at different times. I cannot return them since I wore them outside. I will try to modify an insole to correct it, but since the shoe is built that way, I'm not hopeful it will work. NOTHING said that these shoes were corrective for people who supponate.
Pick the Right Size!  They should not call this unisex sizing...it is Men's sizes. I guess I thought since they were pink they would be women's sizes. Don't be fooled like I was. I had to pay double shipping charges for nothing.
poor shoe for running  Not a very comfortable shoe for running seems to have missed the mark on size as well , It does not appear to be a true 2E width and cramps the toes
Ater daily use of 3 months, the mesh by the small toe on both sides are already breaking.  Very inferior materials used to construst this shoe.
It was small. The 8 Felt the same as the same sneaker in size 7.5.
The shoes fit great. Thats the only positive to this shoe  The shoes fit great. Thats the only positive to this shoe. I had the first generation of this product and they lasted a long, long time before falling apart. After loving the first gen and finally needing a new pair, I have been highly dissatisfied. The first pair I ordered all ready had the toe rubber separated. Amazon was great in replacing them, but I shouldve stopped there. The next pair were intact, but after a couple outings, they came apart. The toe separates from the fabric and if you walk through some moderate bramble, the fabric gets torn. These shoes will fall apart while walking anywhere outdoors.
Wide foot owners beware!  I really hated to send these back, as they are well built and sturdy, and the design is just awesome! But when I put them on, ouch! Pinched my toes and crowded my arches! Tried walking around in them, but it was not meant to be. The "M" should be called a "Narrow" So unfortunately I had to go with another brand. Salomon needs to go back to the drawing board and develop a better toe box and width option, then I would consider giving them another shot. They really are built well, feel tough, and are very supportive. But if you have wider feet, steer clear.
didnt work for me
I have a pair of GT1000's and they are 9.5, so I bought these at the same size. I could barely wear them at all. My toes were getting smashed. I ended up having to get a full size higher, which I have never worn before.
At Least One Size Too Small!  These shoes were at LEAST 0NE SIZE TOO SMALL. Had to send them back. They looked great but there was no way I could wear them!
This shoe is for people with narrow feet  if you have what I have, and that is "Flintstone feet"... stay away from this shoe.  The shoe laces are especially tight at the instep, making the shoe laces almost hurt your foot.
Hahaha
Amazon - Hooray, Hoka One One - Hooray, But Do Avoid Disappointment...  Everyone is different and Hoka's are not for everyone.  However, BE AWARE THIS SHOE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE STINSON TRAIL.  You might like it better, and I hope it works for you.  However, BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO BUY THIS IN LIEU OF THE STINSON TRAIL.  BEWARE OF INCOMPLETE OR MISLEADING LABELING.  The Stinson Trail has been a wonderful shoe for me and others, but this shoe is utterly different, and, for me (1 person), bad.  I hope it will be good for you should you try it.  However, you will not be able to return a pair you have placed on your feet.  The folks at Amazon have a huge job and do it well (hats off), but this is my biggest and most expensive online purchase disappointment.
Way too long/big.  Had to return the shoes. I've always fit tight in size 11 shoes from many brands including Merrell, but when my foot was where it was supposed to be the was an extra whole inch between the back of my foot and the back of the shoe. They would slide like crazy if I were to run in these. I think If it fit me Id be giving it 4 or 5 stars, so look for an update if I decide to buy another pair.  I do like the design and I can tell the changes they've made trying to improve it and it seem promising, as long as it fits. But until then I cant say for sure.
Do not buy!  Can I give a negative 5 stars? These shoes suck! Sole has delaminated from the shoes. I have had to glue back together several times. Will not buy again ever.
Great to walk around in horrible to train in  Mesh lining is extremely thin near the front left. 60 miles in and already tearing. Great to walk around in horrible to train in.
Only because 0 is not an option! These are water shoes NOT running shoes!!
nice shoes but small  good
The sides hurts my feet
Expected more  Their alright....was expecting more for the price.......
Worst shoe for the dollar, don't waste your money  Based on the cost, these are the worst running shoes I've ever purchased. There is something on the inside that wasn't cut right on both the left and right and doesn't form to my foot. Honestly, I don't know why I keep buying Nike other than they make a good looking shoe. They fit terribly, overpriced, and fall apart quickly. I'm too vane to buy other brands because the designs and colors are appalling. I paid far too much for these shoes and I should have returned them, but I'm too lazy to go through with the protocol. I wear them to the gym, but if I go running I change to just about any other shoe to make it through my 5k. I'd rather run in my jump boots than these shoes, they suck and I hate myself for paying over $130.
Do not buy these shoes.  They are synthetic material and not made very well.  I caught the toe on the curb 2 days after I purchased them and the material peeled off of the shoe.  Now I am stuck with a shoe I cannot wear even though I just purchased them.  I exclusively buy New Balance shoes, but will probably change my purchasing habits now based on this awful shoe.
That was little small
Bad Quality  The inside seams on both shoes rub my baby toes to the point they hurt hours after wearing them.  Was going to return them but, was 2 days past the return time frame...  Really disapointed because I perfer New Balance shoes over others.
since I liked the first pair so much  These are the second pair of these shoes I've bought, since I liked the first pair so much. However, the adhesive on the sole of the left shoe wore out after not much use at all. With the sole falling off, I tried gluing it back, but the glue didn't stick and these shoes became unusable. The first pair of these I bought was in blue and they still get used at the gym. Maybe watch out for the red?  I would have been a devout user of these shoes for the remainder of my running career, but the second pair that I bought broke. If you do buy these shoes then I hope it works out!
Purchased for my boyfriend to wear to work (we are both nurses) he says they are "the only pair of shoes I have ever worn that made my feet hurt." He won't even wear them to do yard work or camping.  He tried to put inserts in them as well with no improvement.
make sure free returns because shoe sizing is bs  won't buy shoes online again
They simply didn't fit.  They were the same size as the new balance that I am currently wearing and they were too narrow.  Definitely not an extra wide.  I had to send these back.  The refund was credited immediately though.
No real bargain, they are constructed to be  $25.00.
This is the worst running shoe I have ever owned.
Too small  My son wear size 9 and I ordeed 9D. When he start wearing them he felt his toes hitting the top. I had to reored new 9.5D and also keep 9D becouse he wear them few times.
They feel great until they rip your skin  These shoes are very comfortable to wear initially, but mine have failed in the back by my heel and are no longer able to be worn without rubbing my skin off.  I don't know if it's a design flaw of the shoe, but in both of them the material has worn off at the same spot where the walls of the back of the shoe meet under the fabric.  I've never had it happen with a pair of sneakers before, so I'm not sure what could be the cause.  The only way I can bear them is to apply tape to where the material has ripped inside.  I am very disappointed in these shoes and feel like a brand I have worn for many years has really let me down hard.  I would not recommend buying this model of shoe.
worst nano eer
I hated this New Balance men's shoe  I hated this New Balance men's shoe! It is possibly the worst show I have ever bought in my life! They lasted less than 2 months, they started to fall apart-the leather separating from the sole! So I went and got new ones and I had the same problem! Besides falling apart they hurt my feet! I would not recommend this shoes for anybody that's looking for good footwear!
Aged very rapidly  Did not last very long . Aged very rapidly
Very disappointing  Zero arch support, very little sole padding.  Wore them for one workout and my feet were killing me by the end.  Returned them for a refund.
OK Fit ,but  The shoe has great lines but the sole is too thin for any jumping or high impact workout. My feet were very sore after one gym workout.
Pinches toes!  Wore these to work for a day, will never do that again. These shoes are meant for narrow feet, wish they made that more apparent. Besides that I think they are over-priced for the build quality and comfort level.
RUNS SMALL!!!  Its really a very pretty shoe but didn't fit me. RUNS SMALL
Delivered April 12 2017. I just noticed 7-12 shoes were different sizes.
Maybe defective  When they arrived I put them on and felt a sharp slope on the bottom of my foot, directly down from my ankle, where the heel and arch meet.  I took it off and saw the slope.  I know they are for pronators and that's why I got them.  I'm assuming the slope is supposed to be on the inside of your heel to keep it from rolling inward.  When I put the shoe on my heel/arch is sitting on top of the slope.  Extremely uncomfortable obviously.  This is the 2nd asics I've owned, previous was the nimbus 13.  Those fit really well aside from some left arch pain due to the arch being too high for my left foot (almost flat footed).  I wanted to get in shape and pick up a running regimine but I'm getting discouraged now.
They were much too narrow and were cheaply made.
Just get the ultra boost, you'll have a better shoe  Toe box is a little tight, the tongue is weird, and they do not breathe as well as the ultra boosts. My feet never get sweltering and sweaty, but these shoes will induce that sort of nastiness. The sole is kinda hard too and not great if you have joint pains  I replaced these with ultra boosts and am much happier.
No ankle support and really sweaty feet!!!!  These are the WORST pair of nikes I have EVER had. NO ankle support whatsoever feel really Awkward when I'm running on the insides of my heels like there's a lump there. I do triathlons and run a ton. I went on three runs with these shoes hoping that they would break in but they never did. Not only is there no support in the ankle area you can feel every Little Rock through these things. I've had three pairs of Nike initiators before this but they stopped making them, I guess I will try to find them somewhere else. Read a lot of reviews about these shoes and her good thing so maybe they work for you, good luck. oh yeah, and my foot got super sweaty. Every time I finish a run it would feel like I just stepped in a mud puddle.
Although they are very good fakes just not for me  The shoes are fake plain and simple. Although they are very good fakes just not for me. The fly knit is spot on but the sole of the shoe where it should be a smokey transparent rubber is black its still transparent just very very dark. The only other thing off with them that I could see on the heel where it says vapormax is a reflective print when it should be black. They fit true to size and light weight like the real pair I have. If you don't care that  they're fake and want this colorway without having to pay $350-$400 on a sneaker reseller by all means this shoe is for you, just not for me.
2 pairs, both defective.  The good: light weight and would be great shoes IF they were manufactured better. Read on...  The bad: 1st pair arrived with a small tear in the fabric on the top of one shoe.  2nd pair has a flaw in the sole. There's an extra bulge in the arch of one shoe. Hard to explain, almost feels like a peddle under the padding in the arch.  Basically it's bad quality control and defected shoes are being sold.
POOR SUPORT IN SIDE AND ARCH. ASICS BETTER QUALITY. THESE SHOES ALL STYLE, NO SUBSTANCE.
Small  Came very small! They were very cute but 3 sizes too Small! Very sad!
Poor quality  The fit is good, and the shoe feels great.  However, in less than 1 month the stitching started to come loose.  It has gradually gotten worse.
They are hard like a  regular shoe do not fit well will probably give them to the Goodwill !
Top seam rubbed on the top of my foot ...dont recommend
TERRIBLE!  Just bought this thing, came home and plugged it in and it barely gets warm on the highest setting! This is the third Sunbeam I have purchased today! On my way to take this one back! My hub pulled a muscle in his back and needs a heating pad that at least gets HOT on the highest setting! This is ridiculous!
Size not as advertised, way to small, ordered size 9.5, they fit like size 8.5.  These shoes sat in the garage for a month before I actually walked in them.  They were a little tight when I first received them, but I figured they would stretch.  Went for a walk last night and discovered they were way too small, they say size 9.5 us, but they are more like size 8.5 us.  I tired to return them, but I've had them for 34 days.
Kindly loose on the sides
articulo llego con defecto daado
too tight  these sneakers run very tight.  I love asics but these are not well made.  would not recommend. Sending back asap.
Check your laces.  Minutes after opening the pacakage and trying the shoes on i went to tighten my laces for my left shoe. (Size 12 4E) when i noticed one of my laces wouldnt go all the way so when i looked at it i see the end of the lace with the plastic ends was cut or damaged and instead of replacing the lace whoever put it together just tied it back to the rest of the lace. Now i cant pull the lace through and i have to now A) return it and wait for a new one or refund B) replace the lace myself C) just live with it. I shouldnt have to deal with something so stupid as this just because someone was too lazy to do their job.
too tight and uncomfortable  I wear men size 10. I ordered size 10. These size 10 running shoes were too tight and uncomfortable. I ended up throwing them away, because I couldn't stand the pain of running in them.
Manufacturing defect and were too small.  I guess i should have figured that they would fit super tight when they are called glove.. But i have vibrams five fingers and those are literally the closest thing to a glove shoe you can buy and they fit awesomely. Plenty of room and give for your foot to fit in. These did not, they were much too narrow, Not wide enough.  Just a tight shoe with almost no give to accommodate for your unique foot. Eventually i did break them in enough so they didn't hurt, but you shouldnt have to do this. Also these are not barefoot running shoes or anywhere near something like vibrams. They felt like normal shoes to me, Ive been running with vibrams for years and these aren't even close. . Despite this i wore them because they were expensive and I was too lazy to return them. Cut to 3 months later and these shoes revealed what i assume is a manufacturing defect. On the right shoe there is a knot of some material in the midsole that has poked its way through the upper layer.  I am very hard on shoes, they rarely last more than 6 months, but i don't find it acceptable that theres a half dollar sized knot of very hard material that has broken through and makes them damn near impossible to wear. I only still wear them while i await new shoes.  Will be VERY hesitant to ever buy merrell shoes again.
Arrived on time and product was as advertised. Very comfortable shoes! I will add additional comments as time goes by but for now they seem great! Update: A short time later and the inside of the shoe is fraying out and becoming uncomfortable...
This shoes will go back to the seller.  I ran with Kinvara 4 & 5 and 6 is a major flop.  The pinch you feel from the upper material is so painful that I can't wear these for more than a mile or so.  I tried all kinds of lace tricks but no avail.  You would think Saucony have figured out their shoes by now especially on 6th edition, but they have not. Loved the cushioning.
Stained.  The shoes are beautiful, if you don't mind a giant weird stain on the toe. Theyre dirty before I even got to wear them. Other than taking a chance that youll receive a shoe that someone seemingly wiped their hands off on, they're really vibrant & would have been worth the price.
poor design, poor construction  Where the tongue is stitched and glued/melted to the uppers creates a sharp edge that cut into the top of my foot every time i bent my foot.  After 5 miles of just hiking, i had sores on top of my feet that bled for almost two weeks.  These shoes would be great if they had a high quality upper made of goat skin leather like the Skora Core.
Cheaply Made  This is a comfortable shoe that provided adequate support for the two months that it lasted. This will be the last pair of shoes that i buy from NB. I have always liked NB because they have a variety of shoes in 4e size which I require. I don't think a shoe should wear out in two months under normal wearing conditions.
The first time I put it on, I pulled it off the heel part.
Not true to size, unfortunately.  Great shoe if they fit.  Not even close to true size.  Ordered an 11.5 medium, got what felt like an 11 narrow, with very tight instep as well.  Too bad.  I was buying these to replace an older pair that had much more room inside.
disapointed  I didn't like them at all
I have pretty average shaped feet and these were very uncomfortable from a height perspective.
zero  very very bad  i big zero i am disapointed normaly it must be correct the size are threre fake i think so
They were absolutely not comfortable to run in  I found the design of the shoe to cut into the balls of my feet, and literally cut the circulation off to the point that two my toes went numb. They were absolutely not comfortable to run in, and did little to absorb the shock of running on the treadmill, let alone concrete. Highly disappointed.
Raw Heel  My husband picked these out as a sort of reward for sticking to his running routine.  They had great reviews and we've both had good experiences with the brand in the past but these shoes just didn't cut it.  Well, they did, if you count cutting into the backs of his heels.  It was so bad that he called me to come pick him up because he couldn't walk home in them.  Just awful.  He tried thicker socks but they're not really suited for that so it just bunched up - but it didn't help the rubbing in the back.  Even tried bandages across the area but that didn't work either.  Too late to return them.  They've just been sitting on the shoe rack collecting dust.  Oh well.  Writing this to let you all know not to wait.  If you get them and they're not 100% the first time, send them back right away and try something else.
SMALL  Nice shoe .TOO SMALL. I guess I'll never learn that an 11.5 at one company will be an 11 somewhere else. Ordered a cleaning spray + sneakers & food. 2 of them can't be returned ,thats cool. The sneakers are stuck in the middle of the order and the return drop [ reason for return ]won't open ! So now I have the chance ,to spend a little time calling on this.......But first time it has happened in hundreds of orders ,having a return problem .
Didn't work for me...  I have previously been running in Brooks PureConnect 2s. However, after many miles, those were giving me bruised and blackened toenails on my smallest 2 toes. I wanted to try these as a replacement, hopefully with better fit in the toes.  They did do that, the fit is much better in the toe box. However, I had a problem with very painful blisters on my ankle, near my achilles. There's really no padding at the back of these, and the result is that they basically sawed into my ankle. It's too bad, I otherwise liked the fit of these.
Too small  Both pairs of New Balance Men's MR10 Minimus Running Shoes that I had ordered recently were too small for me.
Do not buy!  I've had these shoes less than a month and the mesh material on the left shoe is developing many holes. The right shoe is fine. Obviously, the mesh material is defective. Others have posted this same issue. Would not recommend. The seller will not replace.
Glycerin 12 too narrow  I was told the Glycerin 12 shoes were the new Glycerin 8 - however, I bought Glycerin 8s because of the width and the Glycerin 12s are narrow
Great shoe but VERY poor longevity (not worth your money)  I have run in ASICS for five years now and with each pair I have been more than satisfied. Fits and feels great like every other ASIC running shoe. Great shock absorption and full support for the runner's foot. The list of positive performance attributes goes on.  However the positive qualities of this shoe are NULL because longevity is HALF of the normal running shoe life. In other words, this pair lasted less than 150 running miles (less than a year!). Let it be known that I am not a heavy footed runner. I over pronate which means my body naturally absorbs the impact of my weight (which hasn't changed)  For a company with a reputation like Asics this is unacceptable given the 75 dollar price of this shoe.  Save your money and research other higher quality running shoes from Asics that fall into the same price category. This shoe simply isn't worth the money!
Had a pair of Pearl Izumi like this before- put tons of miles on them- same size same shoe except different color- not sure what the deal on these were this time- they are way too small- I normally wear a 13 but run in a 14 - my foot has not grown- I'm 50 yrs old  I did a 70.3 IM in my last pair but a few runs in and black toenail -- would love to return these but there was no return info in the packaging -- guess these are give always to someone else - ver disappointed
Even a full size larger isn't adequate.
Size comes in smaller size  i want to love this shoes, however Size comes in smaller size and not enough cushion. buy 1 size larger if you are a natural runner
always wear new balance. First time they were short.
Nice looking shoe but bad quality  Not very happy with quality of izumi shoes..
I don't like look like  I  don't like look like used
Too narrow too small(like half size) and like no give or cushion  Too narrow too small(like half size) and like no give or cushion, obviously the treads are designed for training but there is too much sole and they are kind of unstable. I can't see these being good for any kind of fitness really.
M in size does not mean men's  I love these shoes BUT the only size listed is M. Bought my size in men's and they've arrived and are WOMENS so they don't fit me. Would have ordered a women's size in the first place had I known!!!
Shoe sole gone in 2 months  This is worst shoe I purchased. Intially i was very happy but sole is gone in 2 months. As shape is getting out I need to throw out. Worst purchase
poor shoe to running
Overpriced and too stiff  My husbands ankles have huge, raw sores after wearing these boots.  He thought they just needed to be "broken in" but still the irritation persists.  This is with wearing thick cotton socks.  They look nice but are really stiff.  One of the laces broke after just a few wears too.
Poorly made, lasted only two weeks before a  Tara developed on the side.
Not good  Too tight where the plastic rim is :/ hurts my feet and the tongue doesn't stay in... overall, very poor quality and fit for Reebok. They are usually better than this
Very large arch  These shoes were a bit on the tight side, and the was very uncomfortable. I wore them for a few hours and had to take them off and return them due to this. If purchasing, be aware of this!
Great shoe! Inaccurate sizing. Previously worn!  I love these shoes and thought I had found a great deal but when I got them they were too big and had been previously worn. I sent them back!
Stupid me, not gtx
Expensive and not comfortable at all  I would buy this product any more. Expensive and not comfortable at all.
They run half a size small.
Good shoe in terms of technology, very small and tight though!  I have wide feet. My foot size is between 7.5-8. That's the reason I bought a size 8.5 4E. Shoes were delivered well before expected delivery date. Packaging was nice and intact. Shoes looked perfectly fine.  But when I put the shoes on, I felt like someone had turned off the circulation in my feet. They were so tight that I got a cramp in my left foot near the tongue pad area. I figured if I ran with the shoes on for a while, they would loosen up. That did happen, however, they still feel tight. Also, 4E shoes aren't as wide as I have seen with other shoe manufacturers like New Balance. My little toe is protruding from the side of the shoe. I'm afraid that it'll tear through the fabric of the shoe eventually.  All in all, it's a good shoe as far as technology goes, but I'm going to stick with New Balance running shoes from now on.
No good! After just three months, the shoes sole took off. High price, Bad quality!
Toe too tight  I got size 10.5, the shoe is much too tight on the top of the toe where the laces end, otherwise the heel felt nice and the shoes looked good.
Broke My Foot  Ran seven miles in these shoes and stress fractured my foot. I slowly worked up to distance runs, by running 1 to 2 miles each day for several weeks, as to strengthen previously unused muscles. When I ran in these I also got terrible pain in my calves.
Disappointed - not a super positive experience like so many reviews here and elsewhere.  I did a simple 3.6 mile total out/back run with an 800 ft. ascent/descent on maintained single-track.  The friction lock on the laces kept slipping, so my toes were never properly held back from jamming forward into the toe-box on descents.  Also, the right insole slid back one inch, presumably during the ascent.  This run was only one notch up from running on low rolling terrain - there were no rocks, roots, mud, puddles to jump over, ravines to jump across, ledges to scramble up or jump down from nor gullies to straddle - I can't imagine tackling true trail running terrain in these shoes.  Sure, I could change the laces out and use a standard surgeon's knots, and I could glue the insoles down; but why, when I have plenty of other trail running shoes that never fail me over rocks, roots, mud, jumping over puddles and ravines, scrambling up/jumping down ledges and straddling gullies.  Traction was good.  The heels are a bit high to get any real kick out of them - and that was definitely a liability on descents.  Since I couldn't keep them tight, I didn't try any sideways foot technique on steep ascents/descents.  When I trail run in a pair of shoes for the first time, and they are working great, I go looking for terrain to test their limits with.  The thought to do that never crossed my mind while running in these shoes.
Not real NB quality!  Not real NB quality. I bought this in thanksgiving 2015 deal of the day.
New or Worn?  Ordered a pair of Brooks Men's Beast 16. When they arrived it was apparent to me that someone either tried them on or actually worn them.  There were no tags that normally come with a new pair of sneakers, also absent was the paper commonly found inside a new pair and the shoelaces were already tied.
Wide/length OK. The section under the shoe laces is attached to the shoe. I have a high instep and have a difficult time trying to get my feet in the shoes.
since I liked the first pair so much  These are the second pair of these shoes I've bought, since I liked the first pair so much. However, the adhesive on the sole of the left shoe wore out after not much use at all. With the sole falling off, I tried gluing it back, but the glue didn't stick and these shoes became unusable. The first pair of these I bought was in blue and they still get used at the gym. Maybe watch out for the red?  I would have been a devout user of these shoes for the remainder of my running career, but the second pair that I bought broke. If you do buy these shoes then I hope it works out!
the eyelets are made of plastic, cheap plastic, had to return them because one of the eyelets came out when trying to change the shoe strings cheap materials, I would have expected more from a name like wolverine. The eyelet on my previous pair of wolverines did the same only after 6 months.
Good Fit - Modest to Poor Durability  I typically wear my shoes until they fall apart; which as you know is not healthy for your feet. That being said, that is exactly what happened to these shoes.  They lasted less than 6 months with maybe 3-4 days use per week.  I would not call my use heavy, but I would not call it light either.  They fit well, and were comfortable until the sole started to detach from the bottom of the shoe.  The search for replacement shows for the Costco brand continues.  I thought this was close, but in the end they wore out much faster than I expected them to.
Too Narrow  Not a fan. This is my 4th pair of ASICS (second of Gel-Kayano) and these hurt my feet. Honestly, I'm not too picky on shoes but these were too narrow. I've never had that problem before and I got blisters in the heal. I'm disappointed based on the price point on these. They aren't even that comfy to just hack around in. I still wear my old ASICS for yard work but these won't last. Too bad for the money. I never once ran in them b/c they never felt comfortable enough.
I ordered black, picture was black....they came red.
They look great but very snug fit  They look great but very snug fit. My roommate is a half size smaller than me and they were snug on her feet too. Returning,
This shoe ain't got no sole...  I have a painful bunion on my right foot, and need a shoe with a wide width to fit comfortably. So I buy men's Asics, and until this purchase, I've been happy with them.  I didn't buy these on Amazon, but from a running store in a state where I was visiting. The shoes looked snazzy, and felt great. I wore them out of the store. I wore them one to three times a week for a couple months, among the rotation of shoes I wear to work, before I noticed a flapping sensation on the right heel. Sure enough, the black portion of the sole was peeling away from the white portion on the outer heel. It was annoying, but tolerable, but then a couple months more, and the black tread is peeling from the inside of the heel and the outside of the toe box.  Unfortunately, this is well past the time most shops will take a return for a defective shoe.  This is the only problem I'm having, but it's kind of a big one that the sole is falling apart after less than a year of light to moderate use.  Can anyone recommend a good rubber glue...? Just kidding.  Unless you can recommend a really good glue.
Runs small  I wear a 13 in most shoes because I cannot find a lot of 12.5's. I ordered the13 and my toes hit the end. In addition to that I did not think it was very comfortable?
Not Water Proof. Seeps water in through the seams that connect the outer sole to the toe box.  I thought that it was a defect in one pair but it happened with the replacements. Altra Provision are comfortable for walking in dry weather but appear to seep water in through the seams that connect the outer sole to the toe box and or the seams of the toe box itself. My experience in even the lightest rain under an umbrella, was that my socks and toes get slightly wet. I had zero success in multiple attempts to water proof them.
They start out great... but....  Loved these shoes when I first got them... BUT, after a month or so, I noticed tearing in the webbing on the corners of the toe box (which many others have reported in the 1-2 star reviews here). I did not run on rugged trails in these shoes, I wore them 3-4 times per week at work, where I walked lightly in them. After about 3 months of owning the shoes I reached out to New Balance customer care on their website and they were no help, they referred me back to amazon but I was outside of return policy. I decided I was out of luck... After about 8-9 months the tearing had gotten so bad that I was embarrassed to wear them anymore. I wrote to New Balances corporate offices a couple weeks ago with pictures of the issue, they responded with a $50 gift certificate for newbalance.com which I'm OK with... I guess I'll try another model of New Balance without the materials these shoes have, because i think its a flaw in how they are made.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE SHOES.
so inevitably there is a constant and annoying big toe rub  My past three NB athletic shoes seem to have gone from size 15 to 14.5 or less; as some in the mid-50s, I don't think my feet has grown any.  The problem is that the shoe's length does not give, so inevitably there is a constant and annoying big toe rub.  Wish NB would take a careful look at the size.  Wonder where the sizing was done.
High arches  If you have high arches, these might be for you.  I do not have high arches and they are very uncomfortable.
Save your money unless you are just looking for a causal shoe to wear around town.  The makers of this shoe ask that I send them any feedback before posting my review on Amazon. Below is what I sent. They chose not to respond so I'm guessing they are not surprised to receive such a bad review. My advice is that if you are considering a purchase of this product for anything else other than to just wear out on a causal day for looks then I would seriously consider looking at other options. This was my email to them: I sent you a review on the previous pair of shoes I had shipped to my son that is hiking AT. You were gracious enough to credit my Amazon account so I could order him another pair. Here is his remarks when I spoke with him after receiving the new pair. He told me yesterday after only 30 miles of hiking the tips of the shoes are already cracking and peeling apart. They slip on every tree root and rock. He has hurt his big toe because of slipping off a rock and wedging his toe underneath another one. The tongue on the shoe is shredding where the laces get pulled tight. They are far from water resistance, the slightest water and his feet are soaked. We were hoping he would get a minimum of 400 miles out of these shoes , however with only 30 miles on them and they are already doing all of this he doubts he will get a 100. I'm really didn't want to write this review but you ask my opinion before posting on Amazon. These shoes can not and will not hold up to hiking. Maybe just a causal shoe for looks but certainly not for any type of physical activity. If I rate them on Amazon I will give them a one star along with his comments. We are really disappointed in the quality not to mention the added expense of having to purchase another pair of quality shoes to replace these after only a 100 miles. This was a huge waste of money not to mention the pain he has endured from his toe injury.
Too small zero comfort!
My big toes have punched holes in the top of both shoes.  The shoe is badly designed as their is no reinforcement in the body of the shoe directly above the big toe. I walk a lot: about 7 miles a day and I have holes in both shoes above my big toes. adidas Vipers NOT recommended.
run quite small. Uncomfortable  Size 13 it rubs badly on the toe.  Probably would be ok in a wide but then my foot would be sloshing around.  Overall it seems to be a bad cut for an athletic shoe.  Also very firm interior. Not very comfortable (note I only wore them in a house not running)  I'd order large if you're running in them.
Low quality, flaky sole
You will be fine.  I have come to learn I have odd shaped feet. They never fit right. If you have a standard normal foot. You will be fine.
Not fitting
Low quality foam  The foam soles were cheap and could be compacted easily. If you weigh 85 lbs this might not be a problem; but I returned these because they were doomed to fall apart after a few weeks / months.  I literally wore them for 5 minutes, took them off and the foam was showing hard signs of wear.
Tread separation after 3 weeks  The aggressive tread of the Fellraiser worked great for pole hiking the local ski hill until it began to separate from the sole of the shoe after 3 weeks of use.  I am a normal sized guyThe size 14 fit was on par with what I expected.  I wish Salomon would bring back 13.5 sized shoes as the XT Wings worked well in the past.  The lacing system seemed solid and my heel stayed in the heel cup climbing steep terrain.  Unfortunately, I will ask for a refund and move on to another brand.
Too small
Not like the old Gravity  Absolutely loved the prior Gravity. This shoe did not work for me. The toe box was narrower and my feet kept falling asleep. Gave them away.
Tight Fit  Tight fit in the toe and just narrow all around.
Very thin useless  I bought this shoes from local seller, ran about 6km I can feel every single rock, stick everything got into my feet... My feet hurt, do not recommend
Not wide enough tight in the front
Garbage, tore after 2 wearings.
Nice shoe but problem with the lace-up design  I bought these shoes in January.  Love the shape, style, weight and traction of shoe.  Good price.  A problem came up with the lace-up bracket.  As you can see from the picture the top half of the shoe has a Plastic/metal bracket at the top that you run the laces through.  This bracket is secured to the shoe by a small piece of fabric. About two weeks ago, a tear started in that strip of fabric.  Now the tear is all the way down, so the bracket has come undone.  There's no way to lace the top half of the shoe now, there're are no other holes to lace through.  So the shoe has become a slipper.  I'm going to try to punch holes in the top of the shoe with a nail to run laces through, shouldn't have to do this on a shoe this new.  Amazon says no one else has this problem, seems like a design problem to me.  Lots of stress on that cloth strip.  I'm too late to get a replacement.  I can return for a partial credit depending on condition of the shoe.  So just a warning that if the bracket starts to tear away, replace them immediately.
The original fat tire shoe was SO MUCH better  The original fat tire was better! Like many other reviewers, I like the design of the sole and the comfort that this line of shoes provides. The neoprene sock liner has grown on me, too, and I like it. The ratcheting tightening system seems like a fun novelty at first, but I find that it's hard to get it to tighten my laces enough. The section across the midfoot is always too tight, and the forefoot is always too loose. I'll run for a bit, and it'll all loosen (because I think it pulls lacing from the forefoot to loosen the midfoot). I'll try to tighten, but once I'm sweaty I don't have enough traction on the knob for it. It kills me because this "lacing system" is a step back from traditional laces. I love this line of shoes, but I hate the modifications they made for Fat Tire 2. I hope UA will eventually make "Fat Tire Classics" that are the original model.
Worse shoes ever. Very uncomfortable
horrible..  i always use 1080 for preparing marathons, for training long distances 20 kms 30 kms , i weight 67 kgs , but with this model i cant !!! because  the inner toe big mound  the metatarsial bone , have been cut by a edge inside the shoe , the shoe isn't confortable for running as the same models before ,...horrible ...only for walking
Wire mesh tores off in 6 months
Poor Poor Quality (Insole Problems)  This is the first time I am extremely dissapointed with Asics' product quality. The tennis' insoles did not feet the size of the shoe resulting in a very discomfortable feeling. Additionally, the insoles were "glued" yet not check for "bumps" inside the shoe resulting in an uneven surface. The tennis' design is very attractive yet its quality is bad. I do not recommend this shoe if you want to use them daily (+8 hrs)...you will not withstand them for more than 2 hours.
Looks great! Sole is coming off thogh.
My heel slips when you walk, Disappointing.
WiIl not buy again  sucks..never had a pair of NB fail..These have a hole at the toe after wearing them for a few months.
Great looking, responsive shoe. And as durable as Kleenex.  I ran in the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/MT10GY-New-Balance-MT10-Men-s-Minimus-Trail-Running-Shoe/dp/B004Z20A36/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">MT10GY New Balance MT10 Men's Minimus Trail Running Shoe</a>&nbsp;(Last year's model) for most of 2011 & loved em. They did, however, start to break down after an admittedly tough year. And so I was excited to get the 2012 model this Spring (the MT20v2 in Cherry Tomato--Hot!). I bought them at Foot Locker soon after they came out in Mid-April.  And I liked them. A lot. They felt just like my shoes from last year, responsive & tactile, but with a less-constrictive, more comfortable toebox. However, about two months after I started running in them about 10-15 miles a week (mostly on trails, some asphalt) they developed holes near the toe hinge in each upper. I was bummed, but continued to run in them for a couple weeks. And now, every time I go for a run, the holes get bigger. It seems like New Balance still needs to work out how to keep the structural integrity of the toebox without making it too restrictive.  I'm not super hard on shoes, and my expectations for minimal shoes aren't that high. But 2.5 months is way too early for complete structural disintegration, at least in my opinion.
Do not purchase  I always buy salomon shoes because they are durable and the company offers a 2 year warranty for any defects no questions asked. I bought these and when I received them they were manufactured in 2015 and were almost 3 years old when I received them brand new. I have worn them for less than 2 months and they are falling apart. The tread on the shoe is completely peeling off. I would not do business with this company again Im not even sure if these are real salomon shoes as all my other ones lasted for years
Good shoes but won't last past 2 months.  Shoes were good for the past few months and new the memory foam is falling apart within the shoe. This happen within 2 months. Beware of poor quality that doesn't last.
Not happy!!  I thought they would be brand new! Obviously not!!!!!! When I received them, the soles where uneven. The gold had started to peel and it looked like someone tried to reprint the shocks on each shoe. My husband has had these for 6 months and wears them regularly. They seem to be holding up well. I'm just unhappy about the outside appearence of them.
never buy them  I am a marine so i have to run a lot. i looked at all the reviews and did like every one advised got it a half size big and they are boats. i went on one 3 mile run with them on wanted to run with out shoes a mile in
Expectations Dashed  After all the positives about this shoe, I was very disappointed. Why? Well, every time I wear the shoe I get pain in my left ankle area, not while I'm running but at some later time. I thought well maybe the shoe is not broken in ( I've worn it 5 times), yet running easy on a flat dirt surface yesterday brought about the same situation. I cannot recommend this shoe.
THE RUNNING SHOES  FIT TO TIGHT AND NO SUPPORT AND HAVE ONLY TRIED THEM ON REALY DONT WHAT TO DO WITH THEM AND THE SELLER KEPT THE RETURN STICKER.
Way too small  When you can't even put your foot in a shoe that is nominally the same size as every other shoe in your closet, that says something.
Not a fan of this shoe.  This shoe is definitely not meant for anybody that has a narrow foot.  In addition, the sole is too flexible.  If you are actually doing some hiking, stepping on a rock can be painful.  The shoe laces are terrible, even with the small "loop" meant to cross over the knot.  Even after I've tied a double knot in the laces they come untied after a little while.  Wear these shoes to your local tavern with your stylish shorts and forest green Columbia vented shirt.  Not worth the money.
Poor fit.  Small. Sent back.
These flats are super light, and very fast  These flats are super light, and very fast. They are pretty much socks with grip. So, if you like that sort of racer these are good. However, I found many problems that make the shoe a two star shoe. I don't normally write reviews but felt very annoyed at these shoes so i did. While they are light, there is a reason. The upper is very weak so the thicker material that is like a cage around the upper gets ripped starting from the N logo. These shoes also cause bad blisters on the foot for some reason. I've trained with minimalist shoes before and have tried stability shoes and neutral shoes as well and have not had a problem with blisters. These shoes cause blisters every time I run even though they are the correct size. I use them mainly for workouts and have only used them for half a season. These are fast, but last only a season and can cause blisters a lot.
These shoes run narrow
Don't buy them  I got them in Dec 2015 and they looked really good when they came in with no defects, I wore them twice and the third time there was a small tear, after than I stopped using them until summer. I might have used them less than 15 times just as sports leisure sneakers. See the pics below hoe they look. Might look good but are made of very poor quality material. I used 4 pairs of Asics sneakers in the past and these are worst.
I returned them as they are at least one size smaller than normal and quite narrow.
ok  small need double ee
DANGER (at least mine are)  The shoes are relatively comfortable but any time I walk on any liquid (rain or whatever), then step onto a hard surface, it is like walking on ice.  I've almost fallen many times.  I've also tried to wear them while on my treadmill and it is the same issue.  I have not seen a review that has had this problem.  Maybe the soles of mine are made of a different composition.  I will toss these instead of giving to Goodwill as I would not want to be responsible for someone getting hurt.
The shoes were broken  after one month. I am very disappoint
The shoes are large by half a size  And as they are supposed to be 'glove' like, if too big, its no good for long distance running. Moreover, the shoes have a wide toes area, which makes the loose feeling even more pronounced. Now I don't understand Merrell for that matter, why have shoes known to to run big? and why have a different size conversation chart?
The tongue was sewed down & it was hard getting my foot in. I will be returning these shoes.
I found one at a retail store and loved it. I ordered the same size and color  For some reason, these shoes from Amazon fit small and narrow compare to the one sold in other retail stores. I found one at a retail store and loved it. I ordered the same size and color. Seems authentic and all but they are too narrow and small. So now I doubt buying again Saucony shoes  from Amazon
shoes is good but amazon itself sells  used shoes as a new one.first of all  shoes did not come with the original boxes,printed reebok label inside the shoes has gone and under the shoes there is still little stone pieces.they did not even bother the clean them before they shipped.
Lousy design for a motion control shoe  I'm a heavy, muscular man with big, wide, flat feet, and I pronate when I run.  I'm the perfect candidate for a motion control shoe, and I've worn just about all of them.  One thing that is always true about a good motion control shoe is that it is designed to be wide:  wide enough through the sole to provide stability, and wide enough inside to accomodate the orthotics that most people who need motion control will wear.  The Asics Gel Evolution 5 is cut narrow inside and has a narrow sole.  In other words, it's exactly what a motion control shoe SHOULDN'T be.  Even with a 2E width, this shoe would not fit my orthotics.  It also runs a full size short.  Another drawback is that it's lasted (i.e. shaped) with a curved-in shape running from heel to toe.  This is the shape for a person with a normal arch and foot strike.  Typically, people who need motion control need a straighter last, because their feet tend to turn outward.  I could go on, but the point is this:  these will do no good for someone who actually needs motion control shoes.  Stick with Brooks or New Balance.
It wasn't a 2E  I read the reviews and they seemed favorable so I bought the same size Asics I've been wearing, a 10EE. It wasn't a 2E or even an E. I tried one shoe on, with difficulty, and took it right off. Too narrow across both the heel and the toe.
Hard on plantar fasciitis  Nice looking shoe, but terrible to stand or walk in, at least for me. Plantar issues, but my other Pearls are great
Love these before I tried the 17  Last year I got a different pair of the 16s.  I like them so much I ordered these earlier this year.  Shortly after I happened to go to a running shoe store and tried on the new 17s.  They completely redesigned the shoe, and it does take a little getting used to, but I've had the 17s for 6 months now, and I can't even put the 16s on anymore.  I returned these.  Dont buy them until you try the 17s.
too large. not really confortable.
It's a little smaller than the the shoe i had (11 size) the next time I will buy 11,5
Not durable  Applique on top surface cracks and wears out very quickly.
Comfortable shoes, and great to run in  Comfortable shoes, and great to run in, but do not last long. My first pair were the all orange color, which I got 230 km out of before I wore a hole in the sole. My next pair which I bought recently (blue/orange colour) I've used for 120 km and the sole is already worn smooth and thin (see attached picture).  Would only buy again if the sole is made more durable.
Loved earlier shoes, but the '16 are aweful!  I have been a LONG time Brooks Beast wearer, since about the 2011 timeframe.  I wear a Beast 13 4E shoe, so shoes are difficult to find, but have been willing to pay full price for these shoes as they have been GREAT straight out of the box.  Now, come to the '16 model - it SUCKS!  The 4E width is narrower just to start with compared to earlier models.  The plastic "straps" used  over the fabric to help hold the front sides of the shoes together hurt badly when walking in these shoes.  It's almost as if these shoes are considerable more narrow for what a 4E should be. These straps have stretched a little as I have worn the shoes, so there is definetly a break in period that I have never dealt with in the past.  Looking at the shoes now, it looks like part of my feet are about to roll off the side of the shoe, and I am just waiting for my foot to "blow out" the side of the shoe altogether.  I'm not 100% sure, as my feet are slightly different lengths, but I do believe that the shoes themselves are actually shorter than what I have had in the past, meaning that I don't have as much toe room as in previous models.  I'm going to wear these until they wear out (because I'm too cheap to thrown them away), but this will be the LAST pair of Beast, if not Brooks that I will ever own.  I have no idea of what I will wear next, but it won't be these shoes!
a very nice product. Great look  Overall, a very nice product. Great look, comfortable and flexible. That being said, the sole is cheaply made and came apart within 3 days of working out.
Very poor quality shoes. Wore out in 6 months  Very poor quality shoes. The sole came off after 3 months and the fabric/material ripped apart in 6 months. Did not expect this quality. Makes me wonder if they were even genuine.
Dont buy  Do not buy. They are fake New Balances shoes have fallen apart with in the first month of use.
The damn things squeak  After wearing Kinvara's for the last two years I decided I needed more cushioning and so switched to the Omni 12.  Unfortunately it has too much cushioning.  I feel like I'm running on marshmallows, and I haven't gotten used to the feeling as I thought I would.  After about a month of wear the left shoe started to squeak.  It's incredibly annoying and a little embarrassing.
... had a wide foot and for years have been happy with the shoes from new balance  I always had a wide foot and for years have been happy with the shoes from  new balance. But this last pair that I have  only worn for four months had the seam at the top of the toe rip... Really,  how much stress do you put on a seam on the top of a shoe. Also the coating seems to be chipping off. So I'm going to have to agree with all these other latest reviews and say where has the dependable NB shoe gone?
Awful. Not worth it.  Really wanted to like these shoes but the toe box is so tight that they've bruised the toenails on my big toes. Tried thinner socks, no socks, and they just never broke in the way that I thought they would and how past pairs of NBs have for me. Probably will hesitate to buy another pair of NB after this awful experience. Unfortunately the window to return them is up so I'll probably just donate them.
Size is not true to the other versions of the 1260. The toe box is too big and it seems that the shoe has gotten longer by about 3/8 to a half inch. It rubs my pinky toe on my right foot and causes pain that none of the other version have done. The 9-2E that I have in the version 5 is a much better fit then the v6 which is quite large for the smear size.
Shoes are way too small  I am normally a size 12 and a half I order the 13 because according to all the reviews you should order a half size bigger 13 was still too small I wore them one day thinking I had to break them in they never fit and now I can't return these
... worn New Balance shoes for 30 years and been happy with them  I have worn New Balance shoes for 30 years and been happy with them.  However, these shoes are falling apart.  There is a separation of the shoe by the eyelets.  It concerns with the quality of the shoe.  Also, I have only been wearing these shoes and was planing to run in them today. A real bummer!
Order 1/2 Size Larger  I wear a size 12 and these are very tight on my foot. Wanted to return them but was 1 day beyond the return period. Had to give them away.
Tighter than a knocked knee nun.  Not even close to matching the size.
Not flexible & pinches the foot  These shoes are not comfortable and they do not flex well.  The plastic like material pinches my foot when trying to bend & flex the toe area and the top of the foot.  I returned them the same day.
Just felt wrong the moment I put them on my feet.
Not nearly as comfortable as the first gen.
Stained.  The shoes are beautiful, if you don't mind a giant weird stain on the toe. Theyre dirty before I even got to wear them. Other than taking a chance that youll receive a shoe that someone seemingly wiped their hands off on, they're really vibrant & would have been worth the price.
Don't buy them  I got them in Dec 2015 and they looked really good when they came in with no defects, I wore them twice and the third time there was a small tear, after than I stopped using them until summer. I might have used them less than 15 times just as sports leisure sneakers. See the pics below hoe they look. Might look good but are made of very poor quality material. I used 4 pairs of Asics sneakers in the past and these are worst.
These may now be knockoffs  Bought the Cumulus 16 through Amazon last week because my 15s, which I adored, wore out after a year (reviewed the 16s negatively and my review mysteriously disappeared).  The 16s squeaked horribly and were embarrassing to wear so I returned them.  I found the 15s, the exact model I bought and loved last year, being sold new by a 3rd party through Amazon.  Bought them and these are NOT the same shoe as last year.  Wherever this store is getting these, they feel like knockoffs.  The toe box is way smaller.  My little toe feels like its crammed into the shoe (and I bought a 4E width) and after an hour just sitting in these, not even walking, I had to take them off.  Awaiting a return approval from the store.
quite disappointed in the size and the quality.  I'll never order shoes online again.
The right shoe that was sent to me was incredibly uncomfortable and felt like i wasn't getting any support on the inside of my foot and kept forcing it to roll inward.  The left shoe fit and felt great.  I did have to order a half size up for these shoes.
Didn't like it, was bulky and stiff  Didn't like it, was bulky and stiff. Hard to explain but footbed appeared much larger than the upper so felt like running in cement buckets. Returned.
After two months of fairly limited use one of the soles has begun to separate from the shoe - clearly defective.
defective product  sending shoddy product supplier with details not recommended at all
The left shoe fit fine but the right shoe had a defect and was tight and had a dimple in the fabric where the sewing was defective. I'll be returning these. Watch out for Saucony defects, this is the second pair of Sauconys that I have had to return due to defects and bad fit. Their quality control is terrible.
my right shoe has worn a hole inside of right heel! the shoe is not even 2 months old! want my money back when i return them
GREAT QUALITY
Broke my shoe horn 1st time I put them on
Returned  Did not like the fit or the style of the laces.  Quality construction, but not worth the price either.  Found an alternative.
Too small.  Nice looking shoes, but poor fit. I put them on and went out to walk my dog. In less than a mile my toes hurt from hitting the end of the boots. I typically wear hiking boots 14+ hours each day. With these boots 10 minutes is enough. Now I am looking for socks thin enough so my money is not completely wasted.
Extremely comfortable, but low quality  Most comfortable shoes I ever had. Very light weight and allow your feet to breath. Just one major flaw with these shoes and thats that they lasted a year before the whole bottoms started coming unglued and pieces of the sole started to fall off!
Deceiving quality  I bought identical sandals almost 10 years ago and there were perfect - lasted 10 years!  This ones, brand news, have already two problems: 1) belt leather has sharp edges and cuts your feet,  2) when feet start sweating a little bit the leather tints your feet or socks (if you use one).  Regrettable!  What Birkenstock is trying to do?  To bury their famous quality?
Swag, but too big.  Very swag shoe, ordered a 9 but fits like a 10. Kinda disappointing because I really dig these kicks, but too big.
NB Neutral Running Shoe  This shoe is true to size, but something about the shape of the sole makes them very uncomfortable.  Seems to have something to do with the curvature (or lack thereof) between the heel and toe.  A few minutes of walking leave my feet aching and cramping, which does not happen with other NB shoes.  I would recommend you try these on at a local store, walk around, and see how they feel, before purchasing.
Sizing is wrong  If you wear a 10 and you buy a 10 it will be too small to wear. If you buy a 10-1/2 you might get lucky, if you buy an 11 they will be too big.  Happened to me.  I returned them.
Almost but Not Quite  The inner soles are not removable, hence, not replaceable. I prefer to insert more comfortable inner soles,especially if the originals wear out.
Thought they were great...  Loved the shoes when I received them , however it took over 2 weeks to get. I put about 50 miles on them when I was in the middle of an 8 mile run they just started to fall apart, more like a defect in the plug design, they both did it at the same time. Unfortunately, with this experience I will not be purchasing these shoes again.
Not only were the shoes too small, when i returned them i wasn't offered a replacement. I was only offered a refund because the price had increased 40 dollars.
Bad won't buy again.  One full size small and if you want to return you gotta make your own sticker cause they don't send one which makes it annoying returning mine soon when i get time.
a disappointing update  I became a huge fan of Altra two years ago and it was the instinct shoe that did it.  Shoe companies have a habit of feeling the need to change what works, which is he case here.  This update has a higher stack height, which would be fine as the Torin also does.  The problem is that shoe is too soft inside, almost like a slipper.  Not bad for walking around, but awful for running.  The softness kills the stability as your foot will slosh around in these.  After two 10 mile runs, I developed hamstring pain. I went back and ran in an old Instinct 1.5 pair and it went away.  Two weeks later, I tried these again, and pain came back.  I have running a long time and each runner must find what works for them.  This may work for others, but if you're an Instinct as I was, these will disappoint.  This purchase is already in the trash.
I send it already to HD Sport for an exchange. I need size 42 . But I don't know if there going to return it to me. Im hoping for a response with regards of my little problem. Thanks.
Lesson learned  I'm disappointed because the shoes look like a imitation with poor termination and I spec the original.
Not Good for Cross Training - Poor Quality - falling apart in less than 120hrs of use.  Shoes are of low quality, its less than a year and it started falling apart. This were purchased for tennis games, but with usage of 10 hrs a month it would be less than 120 hrs and shoes are no more usable. I wish ASICS has better quality product. I have used there running shoes and they were of good quality for price of 110 USD. I guess price does matter when it comes to quality!!!
Cloth Webbing on Uppers Does Not Last  I'm 68 and i love the fit and comfort of my Asics shoes, the first that truly make my feet feel great.  However, Asics needs to address a serious problem with wear on the uppers. I'm  on my third pair of Asics and the webbing on my first two pair has worn through within 12-18 months in the same place on each pair (see with my finger coming through in the pic). The area in question needs to be strengthened or just get rid of the webbing there. I can't give Asics shoes better than one star because of this problem, even though it is a great product in my opinion otherwise. I continue to buy them but with the expectation if I wear them I'll have to replace them much too soon than I should have to if this problem was not present.
Inadequate Insole/Support  While the shoes fit as expected, I was very disappointed in the quality of the insole and foot support.  The material of the shoe is breatheable, but feels flimsy overall.  I purchased these since were made in the US, but they don't have the same quality feel that previous pairs of New Balance have.
2 sizes too small  I ordered a full size larger than usual, needed 2 full sizes larger for fit.  Seem like good shoes -- just cant get them to fit.
Not good fit for me  Heel area larger than expected, toebox smaller than expected
I have always ordered this size of new balance. Never had a problem till now
Possible Fakes  I feel like these shoes were fakes. I bought a similar pair direct from nike.com and the quality was NO WHERE near what these shoes were...so just an FYI...
these shoes hurt my toes. they are the right size 7.5 but cramperd up front. After a 10 hr day yesterday at work Icouldnt wait to get them off. idont think ill buy another pair. They always won't stay tied either. People always telling me my shoe is untied.
Do Not Buy These  Flat, stiff, very uncomfortable shoe...thin, cheap material
I purchased 3 other pairs of New Balance running sneakers all 9.5 this pair is smaller , but i needed to wear them for a bit . To find this problem. Sorry
Worst of the DS Racers  Can't believe how disappointing these are.  Long time DS Racer fan here, as well as a coach who recommends these to those who want to get into road racing and are in that stability category.  See from my pic, the previous models (8-white and 10-red) are much better.  For some reason these new ones are much different.  They fit way tighter and as for that hard plastic bottom, I'm not sure how to feel about it, as a racer I would prefer lighter shoes much like the previous model (this one weighs in at 6.1oz, while the model 10 is 5.5oz, and the model 8 is 7.4oz).  I just got these, and so far only been able to try them in the gym (treadmill and stairs), and it is very uncomfortable for my pinky toe. Last I remember, returns are for new condition, so I might be out of luck, so just a warning to all---maybe you should look into the previous models first.  I guess these will have to do for short errands, however, they do take some work when you are trying to get them on.  I wouldn't recommend for wearing for long periods since they are pretty narrow/tight.  If you don't want to be disappointed, try them in a store first and then come here.  As for more comparisons between the models, this one does look more sturdier than the 10s. Well it does weigh more and has the hard bottom, so you kind of expect that.  Its the same/similar material unlike the 8s, which are more cloth-like.  The same tip, which I didn't like in the 10s because one of mine started to peel a little, which was the reason why I looked into getting new racers. Basically everything is the same except for the fit, the bottom, and the fact that they went heavier, which I didn't expect because I thought racers were getting lighter and faster.  If you have the previous DS racers, this will probably not be a good move.  Stick with the 10 if you want speed, and 8 for stability. I can't tell you about the 9s because I liked the 8 so much I have multiple pairs, but I do like the 10s the most now.
They fit like a size 8  I purchased a size 10. They fit like a size 8. Not a happy customer.
I think this would be an excellent running shoe if the size was right  11.5 was too big, size 11 is to small on the right foot. To many miles on them now to send them back. Stick with the Altra One 2, didn't have the size issues with that style. I think this would be an excellent running shoe if the size was right.
Very unhappy  I got these for my son we received them on the 24 of March....today is the 12 of April and the bottoms of the shoes are falling apart ....I am not a happy mom
WAY TOO SMALL  These shoes, while extra-cool looking, were a full size and a half off. My son was very disappointed because they did take nearly three weeks to arrive and were WAY TOO small. The sizing chart needs work. While our money-back process went quite smoothly, they did not have the larger size in stock so had to purchase a different shoe altogether.
Waste of money for deal :) :(  I bought it in winter because of the deal price. Now that winter is over and time to use it but not usable. On left foot bottom it hurts like hell within 15 min of use  but on right foot it goes well. Instead of trusting brand and seller I should have tried on arrival as I can't return now.
They don't know their left from their right.  These came with two right foot insoles and no left foot insole, you need  someone working at New Balance who knows their left from their right. Did not notice this until I returned from a walk so impossible to return...everyone look before you wear!
Price is good but the quality is not good. Not recommended for walking in the rain
Runs small; supplier does not offer "free returns"  Very small sizing on this shoe - - could comfortably order 1 full size up.  Returned for credit - but be careful to watch the fine print - - supplier charges a restocking fee as well as return shipping is on you.
My initial impression of this shoe was that it was an over-priced, cheap shoe.  I confirmed my suspicions about the price when I went to a local Nike outlet, only to find it 30.00 cheaper.  Moreover, the sole wasn't cut in the same way of the original, i.e., in blocks intended to push apart to provide a natural shock impact.  Too narrow inside and out.  The sole outsole was wider in the original.  Maybe just buying the name here.
Narrower than expected
don't do it.  not worth the money. my reef have never disappointed me.  thought I was moving up.  I was wrong. will be purchasing a new pair of reefs in am.
Faulty Construction  There are layer/pressure bars in the sole. It feels like a bar across the ball of the foot that are uncomfortable and not normal.  They both have this but Right side is worse than Left, which means it's a defect. Poor manufacturing quality control. If I were to wear these as a daily sneaker like I intended, I would have pain and problems in my feet and back.  The toe is longer than it should be for a size 8, there was about an inch from the tip of my big toe to the tip of the shoe=too sloppy.
I was astonished when I saw the lightweight construction of this. It great on my feet but I was terrified of walking around outside with it or snagging the side of the shoe on a rock or wall. I would bet that this shoe would not last more tham 5 trail running sessions before your toes are stickig out.  This may be a great shoe for dedicated racers looking for an edge but not for casual budget minded runners
Disappointing shoe  The color was not as described. I was supposed to get black and white, but received eye stabbing blue. The shoe fits fine, but feels a bit flimsy and slippery.
Cut my heels in less than two miles.  These are the lightest shoes I've ever worn.  This also made them feel super cheap.  The soles were extremely thin.  The uppers were glorified plastic bags, with some attempt to make a netting for breathing.  They have almost NO padding at all.  I'm hesitant to trash them in my review as I know that light weight matters a lot to professional runners.  I know that super thin soles are good for transition to barefoot running.  Still, these shoes cut all the way into the middle layer of skin (like a second degree burn) in about 20 minutes on both of my ankles and it took over a week to go from the wet plasma wound stage back to being able to develop a scab. I wear ASICS almost exclusively.  My girlfriend wears similar shoes from Saucony in size 7 and she likes them a lot.  I'd say buyer beware for sure with these.  Maybe I just have boney ankles, but I'd go with ASICS for the extra padding and comfort.  If your a runner...you need your feet and these did more damage to mine than anything I've seen in years.
Fell apart after 3 days  These shoes fit excellent and had good structural support, but after 3 days of wearing them at work the bottom tread/bottom layer began to peel off on the heel of one of the shoes. This is an expected way a shoe can fall apart after a few hundred miles are on it, not after 3 days.  I have been very happy with saucony in the past, but will be skeptical about buying any shoe where the bottom layer of the shoe is thin and basically just lightly glued to the bottom of the shoe.
Too Narrow  I first tried the 2E width, which is what I've worn in all New Balance shoes for years and years and it was WAY too narrow with the ASICS.  I traded them in for the 4E hoping that would resolve the issue, but it did not.  The left shoe felt fine, but the right was too narrow.  I thought this could be a fluke and ordered a replacement pair...exact same feel...TOO NARROW.  I have returned both pair and went back with NB M1080V5 which fits perfectly again.  If you have wide feet, be aware of this issue.
Great sneaker but too small very disappointed.
Too tight at the toes and no cushion at all  I didn't like it ; Expected some cushion at the sole area. It does not have any cushion at all. Also its very tight at the Toe area. Feel as if my feet is tied together.
They seemed to fit at first, but they eventually started to hurt my feet.
I ordered a size 10.5 shoe. When the order arrived the box showed 10.5 but when I inspected shoes they were a size 10.0 and did not fit.
Comfortable but cheaply made  Shoes are very comfortable. But, sadly, they are made with extremely cheap materials. The first attempt to tie them resulted in the lace ripping through the eye. Am returning them ASAP.
4E but not quite...  Maybe this is 4E on Chinese market, but here in USA this is way too NARROW to qualify for anything even remotely close to that width...
Returned  Sent two different shoe sizes, shoes smelled worn and quality of shoes were worn down. These shoes were not brand new as listed.
Junk!!!!  Shoes didn't last 200 miles without ripping!
the height in the toe box was way to tight.
Great for 3 months, then trashed!  I loved these shoes at first.  Gave them five stars.  Now there's a hole in each shoe in identical positions.  Both rear heel treads are coming loose.  There's water getting in on the right shoe front toe from somewhere.  Junked after 3 months for this kind of money is nutso.  I'll never buy synthetic hiking shoes again.  All leather with gortex liners from here out.
sadly just poor build quality, did not last  I have to admit these are some of the worst shoes ever. I have only had them 3 months and they are already toast. Normally my running shoes get rotated to my casual shoes after 4-6 months but after 3 these are junk. The support and soles have broken down completely and my feet kill me after every run/walk. I have to put them in the trash. Not even good for casual wear if you like your body JUNK, sorry NB I l normally love your shoes but these failed badly. This is the second pair that had not lasted at all.
Horrible fit this is the only brand I wear the top of the sneaker hurts like hell..I couldn't even walk in them they are my size I purchased because I have to have hip replacement surgery and I need something comfortable for physical therapy...these sneakers will have me having another surgery.. I don't even think I'm going to have the time to send them back...omg I'm on a fixed income...oh well...and I really needed them..
and they have been consistently great until now  I'v been running in Asics for almost 20 years: 10 marathons. The majority of my running has been in some version of the Cumulus, and they have been consistently great until now. The Cumulus 18 might be the worst design and overall fit I have ever experienced. Simply put the toe box is extremely tight and small. The overall shoe was also a 1/2 size small compared to recent versions. I don't think going up a 1/2 size would help the toe box issue - was not enjoying the thought of blackened toenails- Sending them back.
Not good.
The all-black ones are not real Adidas  Counterfeit Adidas. The all-black option I received from Amazon Prime were knock-offs and I sent them back. They do not match the pictures on here or the adidas site. They are hard and uncomfortable compared to my store-bought cloud foam shoes. The emblems on the tongue did not match, the insoles did not match, there was glue residue on the soles. Etc.
Ive used Asics forever, I Love them, and they allowed me to Run LA Marathon in 2010  This Gel- Excite 2 Squashed out at the Heal and front of foot in less than a month, with mimimal use on treadmill only, No street running, due to Cancer and i just walk awhile on treadmill at Gym, when i force myself to go and keep mind busy, Amazon has Been Great and sent me a shipping lable to return them as Defective for a full refund, I have not seen a Refund yet, but do not buy these shoes even for normal use, And they were made in Indonisia which I feel are Best manufacture for Asics.  Maybe i just go a bad one....I still Love Asics, and hope to Run next LA Marathon in them if Cancer gets taken care of.
very disapointed  they fit very well but the problem is that they wear out fast on the inside the memory foam does not hold up well i am hard on sneakers but i have never wore out the inside before the outside very disappointed with thees for the price
Not flexible  Too stiff.  They're shoes for people who've never gone barefoot before.  Basically regular shoes just with cutouts for your toes.
Did I order wrong?  These were absolutely the wrong size but might have been good otherwise! Purchaser or shipper, you decide? Return was easy.
MOST UNCOMFORTABLE SHOES FOR RUNNING! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND LOOK ELSEWHERE!  At first I was very excited when this arrived but this shoe is somewhat larger than expected. I wear a size 10 - 10.5 Men size shoes. The back of the shoes is kinda spacey and awkward looking because of that extra length. Hold on that isn't the worse part. While I was using this to do a short run on my treadmill which I brought from amazon, this shoe was making so much squeeky noises and after 15 mins of running I already had 2 medium size blisters on my left foot. I was in pain for a couple days and still bearing the scars. Also I developed a bit of red rashes between the skin of where the big toe separates from the rest of the toes. I was only running at speed 4 out of 10 which is like a normal jogging speed. I don't know where all the good reviews came from but maybe mine is a defective pair. Either way I am forced to pay the shipping back!!! :(
not durable  This shoe is great no complains....size was correct and no discomfort whatsoever.....was perfect for driving as well as any other activity....will recommend them to anyone ...plus its a conversation piece !!!.........  update October 5th 2015: after second use little and second  toes separating from sole...not durable
Sole wore out in less than a year!  These shoes wore out in less than a year! I slipped on a hike yesterday to find my shoes have worn paper thin. What the??? This has NEVER happened with my other salomon shoes which I've had for years. Are these really Salomon or a knock off?
Best of the bests  It is  as I was expecting. Best of the bests. Love it
I'm surprised about the great reviews of the shoes  the bottom of one shoe broke in half with light wear in less than a year. I'm surprised about the great reviews of the shoes. will not buy ASICS again.
They were not a 4E wide.
Buyer Beware  I purchased these to replace an older pair with the SAME model number.  (MX608V2)  Well, the V4 is crap. Not the same shoe.  The upper is synthetic, not leather.  The sole is lighter in weight, and of a different material that is less "rubbery."  If I hadn't worn them, I would have sent them back in a heartbeat.
Weird noise!  Looks and fits great. But after less than 10 months of light usage, it started giving a funny noise when I walk. Can't wear it anymore due to this. Not sure what's the warranty coverage on this item.
I was looking for a sturdy running, trail/work shoe  I was looking for a sturdy running, trail/work shoe. Figured merrels would be a good option. However 3weeks into the shoe, the plastic nothings started falling off. Then the treads on the shoe started falling off. I didn't have this problem with the basic hiking shoes so I'm going back to that. Hopefully it was a fluke. I am tires of searching for a shoe that lasts.
Had to return the item and waiting for the refund
Didn't get much mileage  I wore these shoes very little before the mesh near the toes started to rip. I put less than 10 miles on them and wore just kicking around the house for 2 weeks and the rips were evident. It's too bad I have always like NB but have been really disappointed with these shoes. That second star is only because they are very comfortable and feel great running but just don't last. Not durable.
Worse than Brooks Beast  I so wanted to like these shoes.  I was looking for a less expensive alternative to Brooks Beast running shoes and thought I'd try these.  After running in them a few times, I'm in pain.  My arches hurt and I have chin splints.  Although there seems to be good support, the soles feel like they're made of plywood.  Due to winter weather, it took me a few weeks to try these.  Now it's too late to return them.  Never buying Asics again.
They are cut small
It's really funny how you thought to scam people when they work there sweat and money off on this trash
Very disappointed!  The shoes are just two weeks old and the sole is peeling!  This is my grandsons second pair in 6 months! The last pair are shredded! Very disappointed!
Don't buy  Really disappointed in the shoe. It's WAY TOO BIG and poor quality! Will return
These shoes look cool, but they hurt my feet.
Great shoes but too small
Order a Half Size Larger and the next wider width.  Older Style.  Short and narrow.  Crappy arch support for a high arch.
Very fragile shoes  These shoes are great for a couple months, but are not durable. I wore mine as walking shoes and after 6 months the mesh on top of the toe box had torn in several places. Running shoes should be able to take more abuse without breaking
Front is too wide, the shoes length is too small, too much drop. Buy Merrell Tail Glove 3 instead.
he really like the sneakers but narrow so we may return  I purchased these for my husband, he really like the sneakers but narrow so we may return. I wish these sneakers company would make sneakers a wide width more everybody don't have narrow feet.
Go for a step up in quality...go to WalMart  Cheaply made. I don't believe the soles are rubber; they have a plastic feel to me. My pair is pretty  tight on my shoe size (11.5). Shoes are very lightweight, if that's what you're looking for--but I wouldn't run fifty yards in them. Flashy yellow color suckered me in--my bad.
I have had these shoes for approximately 3 months now and multiple tears have developed in the cloth portion of the shoe between reinforced areas. Salomon has a reputation for quality products; this pair of shoes does not meet their usual standard.
Not a true New Balance  Love NB. But i was surprised to get my order and try them on... Too Narrow in the mid and toe region. Size is off too. I am a 10.5 4e but these felt like a 10. Disappointed NB.
Uncomfortable  I would not buy these trainers again, they are uncomfortable
uncomfortable  Very uncomfortable toe box, with seams hitting my foot on both sides.
Fakes  Think there fakes they don't fit right and the chrome is missing in some places and glue spots on shoe would not suggest them
disappointed  My son wanted these shoes and we have only had them a few weeks. He likes the style but the bottom of the shoe is coming apart. I would not buy another pair.
flat fit, developed foot odor.  These are basically flat and provide zero arch support. I have never had a problem with foot odor until this pair of Asics.
Bad
The tongue ripped out!  The second time I put the shoes on I pulled on the tongue while getting ready to tighten the laces and the tongue came completely out.  I've never seen (or even heard) of anything like this happening before.  Obviously it was not attached correctly.  I'm hoping this is just an anomaly because I am returning them for a replacement.  We'll see.
Terrible  Shoes have ripped after 1st wear and are falling apart after two weeks. Nike swish looks to be painted on.
Too small  I'm sending these back .It looks like new balance have changed the way they size there shoes. . I wear a 13 4e and it's about a 1/2 inch to tight in length and more snug than usual in width . Apart from that it's a nice shoe
We ordered 11D but received plain 11, whiich is B width. My son's first game is in two days; he's choosing to make this (too) narrow pair work; if it were up to me, I'd be returning them since they are neithe what we ordered nor what my son needs!
nothing good to say  Barely any cushion, they fit tight, there's no way they would be good for a long race
I would like to know how to make the change  Hello ... I have an inconvenience when receiving the tennis, which I got two of the same right foot ... I would like to know how to make the change ... thanks
sized wrong  Usually wear size 10.5 wide or ex-wide. These were at least 1 size too small.  If you look at the sizing chart, the inches don't look right. They look like great shoes, but the label says 10.5w, but they are definitely not 10.5 wide. Good thing Amazon has a great return policy. I would like to reorder, but I'm not sure what size I'd order...one size larger or the same assuming that one pair was mislabeled. I never wear anything bigger than a size 11, but almost all my athletic shoes are 10.5 D, 2E, or 4E. Was there a mistake in the pair I received, or are Saucony shoes sized that far off from all other brands?
Nice shoes, but a bit too small. Get hot spots on toes, after a few hours walking.  Hoping they will stretch out from occasional use.
Just nice looking  Nice looking, thats it. No support, cushioning, it just feels like you are walking straight on concrete.
Much narrower than the 890's they replaced. Also less flexible. I've put probably 10 hours into them and I am throwing them away. They're rubbing the skin off of my little toes like crazy -- never had a running shoe that does that.
Cheap material  Material in the heel wore out quickly.
Defective materials and/or design of tread cause rapid wear  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/New-Balance-Men-s-MR1225-Running-Shoe/dp/B001RB0XV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">New Balance Men's MR1225 Running Shoe</a>&nbsp;I've owned 20-25 pairs of New Balance running shoes in the past 10 years. Never have I had a pair of NB shoes literally disintegrate on me. After only about 50 miles of running the middle forefoot tread is almost gone having come off in chunks. The rest of the tread on the shoe still has those little dimples like on a new shoe, but the composition of the rubber in this part of the tread is clearly too soft or perhaps improperly formulated. Totally unacceptable. Stay away from this shoe at all costs.
Terrible  I used these shoes as my main running shoes for 2 months. They are completely uncomfortable and fell apart very quickly. I've used "no tie" sneakers before and they can stay tight, but these start to loosen up as soon as you begin to run. The sole does not provide any support or cushioning. The insole is the thinnest I've seen in a long time and I threw them away to use better insoles before even trying to wear them.
I might really like these except the szing is way too small  I might really like these except the szing is way too small. I wear size 11 US in all my other running shoes, but these are at least a full size small. I cannot run in them. Unfortunately I left it too long to return them!!!! I am bummed!
Bad quality  Poor quality, worst tennis shoes ever .  I've have owned for one month, and use them only to walk on threadmill. There's no support at all. The insoles are so thin they hurt my feet and you can actually feel the shoes tread pattern on soles of feet. These will go in dumpster.
Crazy arch.  The arch in these shoes is weird. It's sort of diagonal across the length of the shoe in the middle. Actually, it might not even be the arch, it might be the rocker than migrated half-way down the shoe and turned 45 degrees. Very strange indeed.
Don't buy these shoes!  I have been wearing Asics shoes for 20 years and have never had a problem with any of the shoes I bought until now. Like so many others have said, these shoes are poorly made and will not hold up for  more than a couple of months even for light duty. Both shoes have holes in the mesh. I only wore them  a short time and always indoors at the gym.
is incredible, broke after only 200 km
Not comfy for daily miles.  The heel tab is too high and digs in after a mile or two and leaves a blister. Keep using these shoes daily and that blister ends up a bleeding sore. Who needs that? Yep. A cool look, but painful.
Decent shoe  Going by initial impression these are not bad at all. They seem to provide good traction which is important for me. They are indeed more comfortable than expected. We will see if they hold up under fairly heavy daily use or not. So far no complaints on my end.  Update: These shoes were good only for a few months before falling apart. The main problem is the sole developed holes. Other tears formed as well. The overall rating gets dropped to two stars because of this.
Seems like a great shoe, if I could put it on my foot.  I've owned a number of Merrill boots and decided to purchase these because they were advertised as waterproof and the price was right.  My Merrills are usually a 9.5, but since I broke my ankle, have been a little on the tight end while still being wearable.  So, I figured I'd size up to a 10, which is about the same size as my running shoes.  When I got them, my foot can't even fit in the shoe it's so narrow, which I've never had problems with, even recently.  Put them right back into the box and returned them.
wide size does not fit wide feet.  I have wide feet so I bought wide size and my feet hurt after 1/2 hour. Now im stuck with them unless I wanna pay a restocking fee.  if you have wide feet DO NOT BUY THESE
Not comfortable at all  The shoe feels way to big.  Not comfortable at all, I haveto say they are the worst shoe I have ever tried.
Width a little tight
To spend sell
Poor quality  These shoes look great but they didn't hold up at all. I was so disappointed with these. I thought I was getting a quality pair of trail shoes, but they tore to pieces. So I won't be getting another pair of these
I ordered these in wide and they were still pretty narrow for my foot  I ordered these in wide and they were still pretty narrow for my foot. Seems like a decent quality shoe though.
Returned them because of the width being too small. I had Revolution 2 shoes and had no problem with the same size.
I like the shoe, but I couldn't get my baby toe (left foot) into the finger slot.
14 is not a 14. Very disappointed.  Come on Salomon, make shoes for bigger people! I wear a 14 in every other brand, just got this pair and I can't even put them on. Please make shoes a few sizes bigger.  This is not a 14.
This version of the KSO runs smaller  I have several pairs of Vibrams, including two other pairs of the original KSO model. I bought this anniversary pair to replace my 2011 model, which has over 1,000 miles of running and travel on them. Sadly, the do not fit even close to the original KSO model I have. There is a seam that I can feel along the arch of my foot, which I could tell will lead to blistering. Also, my original size 41s were a bit bigger than this size 41. I will continue to wear my other Vibram models until they just fall apart.
Not tough enough  My benchmark for running shoes is the Merrell Trail Glove. Great shoe that is extremely comfortable and nearly indestructible. With my goal being to run Ultras I recently bought a pair of Ascend Gloves to complement my Road Gloves, Trail Gloves and Mix Masters.  I wanted a minimalist shoe, but also needed the additional cushioning and the more aggressive sole for those softer trails. My first impression of the Ascend Glove was very good. The fit was similar to my other Merrells. Traction on muddy trails was significantly better than the Trail Gloves and the cushioning was just right. 9 runs (230 km) later and I came to the conclusion that the Ascend Gloves are not tough enough to be called trail shoes. The front trim does not reach back far enough on the inside of these shoes to protect the soft upper mesh from rocks and vegetation on the trail. The mesh on the inside of my feet is ripped on both shoes. The outside has also some damage, but not as severe. The Mix Master has the same problem, but with the thicker sole the mesh is somewhat better protected by the greater distance from the trail to the upper part of the shoe.
Shoes no what I expected  Although the quality of materials was good, the sizing was poor. The width is too narrow for a 2E width. There was less cushioning also.. Went for the 1123 instead.........
Rearfoot GEL system fell off after 4 months  After just 4 months of light use, the rear gel separated off the shoe during a walk.  This shoe looks great but was just OK for walking and running. For day to day use, the rear gel system would catch on things like the carpet under the clutch petal, or even the carpet when sitting with my legs stretched out.
These are very comfortable, but cheaply made  These are very comfortable, but cheaply made.  I bought 2 pairs that I alternated using and both pairs fell apart within 3 months.  The rubber sole is not sewn to the shoe, it is just glued on.
Didn't have the durability of other Gel-Cumulus  The Gel-Cumulis is my shoe of choice. I go though 4-5 pair a year and have been buying them for years. I can use them right out of the box for a 20 mile run and will not have any blisters at the end of the run.  I can almost always get at least 400 miles use out of them before the sole wears through. The sole on this version (lite-show) wore out in less than half the time the other Gel-Cumulus I purchase wear out.  I didn't think there was a difference in the materials used to make the Grl-Cumulus but there clearly is.
Narrow  I ordered a size bigger and it's way too narrow.
Most New Balance fit me these did not for some reason? It took me a day of wearing to figure it out I don't know if I can return them or not.
Flimsy design  The top of the sneaker has a mesh that's too delicate; after about three weeks of lite use the mesh wears out and you can see your sock through it. This sneaker isn't very durable. I've noticed the same design flow in other models of New Balance but this one is especially flimsy. Spend more money and get something better.
... always fit in a size 13 but these feel like a  I always fit in a size 13 but these feel like a 12
the pair i received started coming apart in the front of the shoe and at the creases after the second time wearing them..not sure if these were legit or not, but these are definitely unlike any other nike shoe i've owned in terms of quality.
Bad support  It wasn't the item that they describe in the product's pictures.  And i have to pay for their mistake.  Thanks for your very bad support.
Comfortable but the back plastic starting sticking out after 2 weeks  and it hurts my heel.. cant wear them now
Nothing like the comfort of the old Cumulus 12s  I ordered a half size larger and they fit.  I have to leave a 2 star for the comfort level.  If you are looking for the comfort and fit of the old Cumulus 12s its not there.  After walking about 3 miles my feet felt as though I was walking barefoot.  But they look good!
Insanely narrow. Do not buy if you have a wide or even normal width foot.
Cheaper and Smaller  I want to like these shoes.  They are very light, well ventilated, and have great cushioning.  However, they are made in Vietnam and run about half an inch smaller than the wonderful 990 that is made in the USA.  (At least at size 13)  These are of course half the price.
No cushioning
... a pair of Oakleys flip flops I used to love. For the same price range  I bought these to replace a pair of Oakleys flip flops I used to love. For the same price range, the Oakleys seemed like much better quality and I could were them all day long because they were very comfortable. These feel a bit small and are not super comfortable. I wouldn't complain at all if they were cheaper, but for a $100 I expected much better.
Too small
The size does no fot at all  O did not used them, because they did not fit at all, I check vibram and amazons charts separately, i sent them back, I am asking for EUR 42 instead of 40, i am going to try a new pair, probably then i can tell you about vibrammore accuratelly.
Hurts my right foot terribly. Pass on this one  Shoe is low quality. No side support. Hurts my right foot terribly. Pass on this one.

Saucony fail  I only wear saucony running shoes.  I run 4 times a week typically 20-30 miles. I hate giving a bad review but these are just not up to par.  The reflectors are the only good part of the shoe.  The tongue shifts a lot.  Their is no drop so you are flat footed.  There feels like there are tiny pebbles perhaps glue drops stuck inside the sole that annoy you the whole run.  I'll be going back to the fastswitch for the next pair to be sure I get an awesome pair to make up for the last 2 months of running in these.
Too narrow.  Do not buy if you have wide flat feet.  I bought the 2E size for my wide foot and is too narrow in the midfoot.  Feet hurt too much to wear.  Would not buy again.
Returned item
Doesn't match any clothes
No lateral support  Lateral stability is a concern with the high cushion platform and the lack of side support I felt like I was unstable on any type of incline.  I was always worried about a twisted ankle so I returned them.
Disappointed  I bought these for my husband because he loved his Pace Glove minimalist running shoes so much he ran a hole in the bottom of them. Unfortunately, these do not fit nearly as well. The toes are so wide they rubbed a blister in the side of his feet, and going smaller isn't an option as the tips of his toes just touch the end of the shoe. I am very disappointed in the fit of these compared to the Pace Glove.
Fits small sadly I will be returning
Tight fit  Looks great but fits I wouldn't consider it a an average fit. The ML999 is so narrow I could hardly put my foot in it. I think the consumer should have more choices.
The Dart 10's were much better.  Sizes run really small. Had to buy another brand. The Dart 10's were much better.
Cheap interior of the shoe.  I have raced or trained in these shoe only since the end of Feb. (12 weeks) and they are already wore out in the interior heel area.
The shoe was built like a rock. Not flexible not comfortable but does look decent.
Not for my flat fett!  I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THIS PREVIOUS POST! THEY WERE TERRIBLE!  "An absolutely horrible shoe. I was never able to wear them so my son has them now. They were advertised for flat feet people which I am but this shoe did not live up to its ratings for me".
Not like the picture
really bad on the tip point of the shoe, very thigh and paintfull
Quality was not what I expected from ASICS.  Have been using ASICS exclusively for over ten years.  This did not seem to be made to the same quality standards.  One size too small as well.  I am returning.
The heel is too high and when running mid-foot strike these would cause bad blisters on my heel  I tried 3 pairs of these of different sizes and I could just not get them to work with my feet. The heel is too high and when running mid-foot strike these would cause bad blisters on my heel. This is a problem with my foot geometry not matching the design of the shoe but most of the minimal running shoes like the Fivefingers or Merrels don't suffer from this issue for me. The toebox also lacked enough vertical room for my toes. So my toes would hurt after a long run because my long toes would press up against the top of the shoe. I think I could really enjoy this shoe if only they fixed some of these geometry issues. My wife has the women's version of this shoe, and the issues I had with them don't seem to bother her. But the rubber sole does seem to wear quickly on hers.
I wear New Balance all the time.  I buy from both the local retail New Balance store & from Kohl's.  The shoes in both places fit me perfectly.  I ordered the same size from Amazon & they don't even come close to fitting me.  They were so small I couldn't even begin to fit my feet in them.  If someone orders these, they might want to consider ordering them maybe 2 or 3 sizes larger than they normally wear.  I returned them right away.
Not worth the trouble...  The size is on the small side. You will need to request 2 sizes up from what you currently use. The shoelace is very, very short. Would not recommend.
Nylon Laces  I've had these shoes for about 2 years now and they seem to hold up ok, but my big complaint is the nylon laces come undone ALL THE TIME.  Of all the features want in an active shoe, the laces should not be a factor.  I literally have to re-tie the laces several times a day just walking around the office, even a double knot holds together very loosely; what about people who choose these for jogging or other such activities; ride a bike in these? No way! You'd be flat on your face from the laces getting wrapped around the pedals in under a half mile.  They are so bad and do the opposite of what you would want, they belong on the Island of Misfit Athletic Apparel.
Size inaccurate  I was replacing my old Scarpa in size 42.5. These prove to be much bigger in the same size of 42.5 I have tried to add some inserts but without success.
Narrow toe box  The toe box is too tight as a barefoot shoe.  I wouldn't buy these again.
They don't last  They don't last. They develop a hole in the top where your big toe hits, very quickly.
Very Poor Quality Construction  I purchased these shoes in September 2016 to replace my old pair of general walking-around shoes. I don't use this pair in any athletic capacity. While they're comfortable and vent the feet well, they have begun falling apart after ONLY 1.5 months of low wear use. In the photo, you can see on the toes where I've already lost 2 of the treads in the same place on each shoe. Another tread on the opposite side of the toe of one shoe is beginning to come loose as well. My prior walking-around shoes were a pair of Oboz that I picked up for about the same price in the beginning of 2013. While the Oboz are certainly much dingier and beat up now, their tread is still in good shape and could probably go several more years before showing the type of wear I'm experiencing with these Filas after only 1.5 months. I DEFINITELY do not recommend buying these shoes.
The fit was way too tight for a 10.5w.  Had to return the shoes.
Can't stay dry walking through dew  My first time wearing them in the early morning walking through grass with dew, my left shoe became soaked. Well, I'm a caddie and often am walking in the early morning. The entire point of buying these shoes was to have dry feet and they have failed. My right foot even got a little wet at the end of the round too.
Got a size 10 but fits more like a 9  Ordered a size 10 wide. Got a size 10 but fits more like a 9. Put some miles in them hoping to break them in. Hurt my feet too much. Will count this as a loss and toss them in the trash. Not buying from this seller again. Off size makes me think knock off.
Horrible quality, do NOT buy!!!  I bought a pair of these a few months ago as my daily shoes. I don't run and I don't walk that far. I primarily wear them indoors at work and home. One of the pads on the shoes started peeling off. I had to keep it attached with shoe goo. I hope I am the only one that has had this problem, but I won't be buying any more shoes online, that's for sure!  Update, the bottom of one of the shoes is completely falling apart. And Amazon won't even contact me about it!
Counterfeit  I'm pretty positive this is a counterfeit product.  I own two other pairs in other colors, and this pair's sole keeps slipping out (toward the heel) when you walk in them.  The fit is also not the same, but the slipping sole is the real problem.
Improve engineering.  I have used these shoes enough I am reluctant to send back.  The problem is that these are trail running shoes with some kind of plastic slick bottom.  I have already slipped twice where I am certain my other brand trail running shoes do not slip.
Defective Shoes  The shoes are labeled as 8.5, but they are much smaller than they 8.5 ASICS shoes I already I own.  I want to exchange them for shoes that are really 8.5.
Montrail is now Columbia and they've ruined the shoe.  I've been using Montrail as my go-to hiking and trail running shoe for 6 years, and I probably won't be buying them again. Montrail was great for it's width (wide), supportive arch and roomy instep and tow box. All of these features are missing in this shoe. This is the most painful shoe I've ever used. Forget hiking - I can't even walk around my neighborhood without my feet aching ten minutes into the walk. I waited 4 months before I reviewed, hoping for a "breaking them in" miracle. Nope. The shoe is just mean to my feet. Do not buy these unless you have narrow, flat feet and don't plan on walking much.
Beware narrow and little support  I bought this pair of shoes in 11M for my husband which is his size for athletic shoes.  The design and and bright color are very well done.  However, once you get pass the physical attributes and actual wear the shoes then you realize the label medium is fact not accurate.  The shoes run more on the narrow size so even if you order a size up you just have more space in the front but still tight on the side.  The sole is comfortable but the sides have no support whatsoever. When you walk your feet feel like they are about to fall over on the left or right side which happened to my husband on multiple occasion and actually hurt both of his ankle as a result of this.  Definitely try it on before buying and try it out.  If you are light as a feather and have extremely narrow feet then these might be your type.
Shoe lace eyelets rip  Had this shoe for less then a month and the shoe lace eyelets were ripping. Some of the holes are not reinforced and rip easily, it's a shame because the rest of the shoe is very nice and high quality.
The purchase said everything was black  when I receive  them  The material was really dark blue
much more narrow than previous versions  returned these after a trying to like them. I have an earlier iteration of this shoe that I really like, but the current model is much smaller in the toe box and more narrow as well. the foot bed is great, but the overall fit much to small and confining. I do wish there was more consistency in producing these shoes. a nicely made shoe with great support, if your foot happens to fit them.
Awful fivefingers model for over pronation  These are awful for anyone that pronates when they walk or run as the heel sole is rounded causing ankles to very easily roll inward
Should've gotten a 10
Some what small
size chart is misleading for this style. it runs on the small side.  Had to return for refund. Very disappointed. Didn't have correct size so I'm ordering a different style. Still love the five fingers though, no matter what anyone says. After so many years in the military, going as close to barefoot is as comfortable as I can get!
Wierd popping noises  I've only worn the shoes twice and they both make this popping sound. I've looked at the bottom of the shoe and there's nothing there but the same sound comes from both shoes. It's really annoying and kinda embarassing.
I wear a 101/2 in Nikes, but these had a 101/2 size and seem too small.
Fabric tearing, on both shoes in same place, after only 11 months  I am really disappointed with these shoes.  In about 11 months of moderate wear, the fabric is tearing.  If it was just one shoe, I would think that I caught it some something sharp.  But both shoes are tearing in the exact same place and have just about the same amount of damage.  This makes me suspect that there is a design defect and it's not how I've used the shoes.  I've gone back to Nike.
Defective Shoe  Very disappointed. I recieved these shoes on the 10th of February. In one month of normal wear the bottom sole is seperating from the shoe. I believe it is a defective shoe, since it is only one shoe. I can not return since I am just over the 30 days. Never had a problem with New Balance before......
Soles Fell Off  The soles fell off of my right shoe in the first week of having these. I'm going to attempt Salomon Customer Service, however, its still a pain because I'm probably going to have to send my shoes back and won't have them for weeks.
No longer the best!  --- Got the shoes they were marked the same but were two different sizes and felt funny flimsy. I was instructed to return them for another pair, but had to pay for the new pair before a refund was issued. The new pair arrived and had the same issues, shoddy workmanship and cheap materials, and for very expensive shoes. The brooks Beast has been my go to shoe for many years and all that was needed was to order a new pair in the right size and that was it! If it weren't for the fact that these were bought from Amazon and Brooks, I might have believed they were a knockoff. Don't buy Brooks -- INSTEAD BUY --- NEW BALANCE MADE IN USA, not to be patriotic but to be comfortable.
dont't buy shose from internt  Small it hurt my feet
Upper seperated from the sole in three months.  Ive had these shoes for three months and the upper has separated from the sole at the toe.  Amazon says they are no longer eligible for return, which is absurd.  A pair of $65 shoes should last more than three months.
Returned it as the tracker inside stopped sync'ing with smartphone. Bluetooth sensor on it failed(I think).
Pega-sucks  My foot pronates and I have purchased the Nike Pegasus for the last 7 years to help with this. This years Pegasus 32 pega-sucks. I've rolled my ankle twice with this shoe and almost broke my ankle, thanks for that Nike. Also minimal arch support and seems to be more narrow than the last pair. I'll go back and by an older pair on Amazon for $50.
One looks new (color) other one is like color less  One looks new (color) other one is like color less , but I don't care because is for play indoor soccer tho
Pathetic  Pathetic quality.  Absolutely laughable.  My 12 year old son pointed out that it looks like the entire sole is made of styrofoam.  Its insulting.  Cheap plastic stickers over an even cheaper netting "material".
too small on my feet. i use converse all star size 10 and fit well. But this Adidas 10.5 doesn't fit me.
New design bad fit  I previously ordered the due balance 608 and love them for a year. I order the updated version and the size 13 was too big. I returned it and ordered a size 12 Which Was Way too small. The new design does not work for my foot.
Not for my foot.  Little arch
Got wa too large and show seemed to have less cushion than I am used to.  Did not wrap around foot as advertised.
A cool looking shoe but...  This is a nice looking shoe at first but the arch supports in the middle of the shoe are too high. After walking about a mile in these shoes you feel like you have to golf balls on your left and right feet, right at your arches. Maybe an ideal fit for some but for people with flatter feet or low arches on their feet this is not going to work for them.
Way too narrow in the midsole, felt like it was crushing my foot despite wearing the exact same sizes with plenty of space.
poorly made shoes  The tops of these shoes wore out before even I was even 1/4 of the way into the soles of the shoes. I would not recommend these shoes to anyone but non-runners who only wear their running shoes around the house.
Not the color red  you expect  Not the color Red that I was expecting!? I'm not sure what shade of red   it is exactly. If its a shade color?  it looks like a Red Pink NOT A SOLID RED!. The picture seems like a darker color red then the actual shoe it self in person.
Asics Trail Runner Fatal Flaw strikes again  Asics Trail Runners have a fatal flaw in the design of the treads. I've owned 2 pairs of Gel Ventures, both of which fell apart in the exact same spot (1 after just a few days), and now 1 pair of Gel-Scram 3, purchased locally, which is coming apart also in the exact same spot, after 1 month.  The Gel-Scram 3 is light and comfortable. It fits very well and has good cushion. However, it suffers from the same tread flaw that I've found in every single pair of Asics trail runners - the 'outer sole' or 'double-tread' construction is built in 2 pieces which will inevitably separate. The glue simply will not hold.  Tread-life of 1 month is unacceptable.
Might work for someone else.  I returned these shoes.  They seemed to fit well and had a lot of arch support, but the support on the right shoe seemed to extend to the outer side of the foot, which made my foot ache after wearing for only a short period of time.
Too Small  I was excited to get them but when they arrived they were too small and too narrow. I usually wear a 10 so that is what I ordered. I was going to return them and get a larger pair but I wasn't sure what size to get. It has been a hassle to get them to UPS so I didn't want to bother with doing it again if the next pair didn't fit. I'm just going to return them. Very disappointed. Big pain to return them.
Wished they were the same design as my last pair  The design has changed since the last pair I had. The reflective stripe cuts across higher on the toe box thus pinching my toes. Also the soles of the shoes are not waterproof. I called NB and they said it was the design? That seemed weird to me especially if I want to run on wet surfaces. I don't like running in wet feet...yuk. I loved the last pair I had though. They were amazingly comfortable and I was tempted to make them a uniform requirement for my staff since they matched our scrubs and were like wearing slippers!
The shoes look great but the tongue of the shoe is too bulky and it hurt the top of my foot. I buy adidas shoes all the time and this is the first pair that hurt my feet.
Won't get another pair from this seller.  The shoes fit well. The craftmanship was garbage. Barely wore them. Mainly used for walking. Glue and sole was/is falling apart on one. They looked worn but I figured it was the type of soft leather. I do like the name brand but I will probably go directly to the Fila website next time and pay the extra. I have many sneakers of the brand and have had them for years. None came from this seller. They still are in great condition even though they have been worn.
Disappointed in the fit for a New Balance shoe  These shoes are oddly built. Pictures do not reflect what I received. I'm trying to cancel other order of shoes.
returned  shoes didn't feel like my old reliable asics. about the same color as my old ones, but the difference was the reason i returned them. In the picture they look graphite grey, well they're not.....more of a bright silver mesh. Hideous. I returned them and will seek another pair of asics, maybe in a store so i can see them firsthand. thank god for prime returning is soooooooo easy and money is back quickly!
IT FELL APART  Having flat and broad feet. This fitted nicely. So since I was gonna be on holiday in London for a week. I decided to bring it along where I could walk and spend all day in it. I took it out of the box just the day before I left. And on the fifth day the sole on my left side fell off.. It's only 5 days old and maybe 25miles of walking. Did I get a bad batch?
Picture and description is what I wanted but received different pair
Just to unconfortable
run way small  First off, order a full size bigger. These run way small and narrow. I normally wear a 9.5 and ordered a 10. Need a 10.5. These shoes are light and airy however they are not very soft feeling in the soles like my zigtechs are. Not happy with them because I wanted a soft shoe like the zigtech and these are hard as a rock.
Sole pieces falling off on 2 pair  I have owned 6 or 7 of this model of shoe.  The last two ordered from an Amazon seller fell apart.  The first pair took about a month before pieces of the sole started falling off, by the time I retired this pair the mesh at the pinkie toe had torn through.  This was the only time this had ever happened to me with this model.  I thought it was an odd anomaly, so I purchased a new pair.  That pair had a part of the sole come off within one week.  Now, in less than 8 weeks, three pieces have fallen off and I can no longer use them.  I have less than 150 miles on these shoes and they are shot.  I will not buy another pair.  What happened Asics?
Uncomfortable!  There is very little arch support which puzzled me since Vionic shoes specialize in creating shoes that help with plantar fasciitis. I do not recommend these shoes. Unfortunately, I did not discover the arch support problem until I wore the shoes to work and now I cannot return them. I have tried adding inserts but then my heel slips out of the shoe. I am very disappointed.
They don't last!!  I paid a lot of money for these shoes thinking I'd have a great long lasting product but after 8 months the cleats are worn off and the rubber is pealing from the shoe.  I only use them for disc golf, walking onlyevery other weekend for 1 1/2 hrs probably 25-28 actual days used.  I didn't expect them to wear out that fast!  They did keep my feet dry but hard on my arches and if they last 3 years would have been a great shoe but only 25-28 days at 1 1/2 hrs per day?
Fake adidas.
Heel support wore down too fast.  Ordered a size 11.5 pair in February. In six months the heel supports on both shoes wore down, with the right shoe heel cover essentially worn away. The circular padding has completely worn down in the back, particularly the top of the shoe where my heel and Achilles tendon connect with the shoe. This is unacceptable level of tear. I barely got half a year out of these $100+ shoes and I didn't even do that much running. At most, 5 miles a week consisting of sprints and jogging.  I am going back to New Balance after this. If I drop $100 or more on a New Balance running shoe, they will last me at least a year regardless of what I put them through.
Seller requiring signature to take delivery of stupid shoes!!!!  I am trying to take delivery of these shoes from UPS (I'm on second attempt) and because the stupid seller is requesting a signature to receive the package I may have to let them be returned to said sender. Unlike a lot of people, I work for a living and cannot sit around the house to wait for a pair of shoes to be delivered just so they can get my signature. I have had thousands of dollars worth of items left on my front porch without a signature and without any problems. For some reason the sender seems to think these shoes are so important that they must be signed for in order for UPS to leave them. I am leaving town in two days and had hoped to take these shoes with me but right now I am so mad that I just might let them go back and get a refund. I now have to take extra time out of my already busy schedule to go to the UPS distribution center to sign for them. I'm still debating whether I'm going to do that or let them be returned. Those businesses out there that require signatures please not that I will not take time off work and lose money just to sit around and wait to sign for something. I will go buy from someone else.
Narrow and tight fit  I bought the D width and they were very tight on my average feet
Falling apart in less than 2 mths  Really liked them but after 6 wks the tongue is coming unstitched already. I only wear them maybe 3 times a week.
My Brooks GTS 17 shoes were delivered on Jan 17, and since then I've worn them about every other day for 5-6 miles of walking. The attached image shows what their condition as of April 1.  This is the third pair of Brooks GTS 17 shoes that I've purchased. They ALWAYS ware through at the ball of the foot, but the first two pairs took about 5--6 months to get to the point that the inside is exposed, while the Jan 17 pair did the same in half the time. It's a shame, because I have pretty flat feet and these shoes really help support the arch well, but $120.00 every three months is ridiculous (even every six months is ridiculous, but it's a lot less ridiculous than three months).  Unfortunately, my next arch-supporting shoe purchase will not be Brooks.
I order size10.5 us but I got a 10 a little small.
Not built to last  While these are the most comfortable athletic shoes I have worn, the midsole breaks down and feels as if there is sand or lumps under my foot.  With my first pair, this happened after five months of walking about 25K/week.  This pair has not even lasted one month!  Two pairs is a fair shot, I think; will not go for three.
Dissapointed  It has only been two months and they are falling apart. The soul is peeling off the toe of the shoe where it curls up, the laces have stretched and show obvious signs of wear. I only where these shoes 36-48 hours a week at work (that's 3 or 4 twelve hour days).
Uncomfortable and stitch on right shoe rubs the top of my foot.
defective tongue.  the tongue of the shoe would fold over and was way too narrow.  socks would be on display between the tongue and shoe gap.
Hope you have stronger toes than I do.  I wore these for a while, but then my toe started hurting really bad. A week after not wearing these shoes... my toe started to feel better. I thought about it, and came to the conclusion that maybe I had hurt my toe in my sleep or something and it wasn't the shoes at all. So I started to wear them again. Within about 3 days, I could barely walk because my toe was all jacked up. I have not worn the shoes since, and my feet feel fine.
Good shoe, defective pair.  Comfortable as can be but the left shoe the rubber is peeling off the front and the thread is starting to fail. Haven't worn them more than a handful of times so im really disappointed. Contacted the seller so we'll see if they can right this wrong.
They must have really skimped on material for these shoes as I have another similar pair of New Balance that are 8 months old an  I have been wearing New Balance shoes for over 20 years and this is the first pair that didn't last at least 6 months if not a year. Within 4 weeks of purchase they had a hole in the mesh over the big toe. They must have really skimped on material for these shoes as I have another similar pair of New Balance that are 8 months old and they are in much better condition than my "new" pair. Do not buy this model of New Balance.
Don't expect good logical customer service from the Athlectic Shoe company  This review is a combination of the product but more importantly the Athletic Shoe Company customer service. -This pair of shoes had a total heel breakdown on the right shoe causing extreme pronation leading to right hip pain. -I am a long distant runner, Marathons and 1/2 Marathons.  I buy my shoes early and ease into them before my current pair is finished. -I sent pictures of the heels so they could see the issue, and pictures of the tread to see they were practically new with no wear. -These are expensive shoes and should last more than 35 miles, they did not. -I am a big fan of HOKA this was my 4th pair so I know this was an abberation. Simply wanted an exchange. -Recieved reply same day rejecting the return request..no consideration given for the defect....it was 60 days past purchase. I didn't even use them until after 60 days...as I said I buy early and ease into them. -I contacted HOKA directly and they immediately agreed it was defective and gave me a direct return even through I did not buy from them.  Moral: Don't expect good logical customer service from the Athlectic Shoe company. Even with the explanation of the defect they rejected.
Took a chance, with the low price.  You get what you pay for.
My size but these are not like other new balance purchased
Not the same shoes  I own these shoes in Black and White and thought I'd order these ones as well because they really are super comfortable. Unfortunately, the shoes that I received, are not the same ones in the pictures. The ones I received have a purple stripe on the sole instead of the red and the fly-wire is orange. They look weird to be honest.  If you like the ones in my photo, then go for it, but if you want the ones in the product photos, then don't buy them, I'm sending these back.
too narrow in the toe  These might be fine for someone else, but they were way too narrow in the toe for my feet. I wanted the ankle support, but I finally gave them to Goodwill.
Running Shoe  The shoe fit as expected; however, it had no cushion and felt as if I was running barefooted. Do not buy recommendation.
Too small  Toe box too small. Asics says they have had lots of feedback about this. Hope they go back to previous design
Small fit  Very small, didn't fit. Looked ok, but not for me.
Very Poor Replacement for the # 1012  The New Balance #1340 shoe is a very poor replacement for the #1012 shoe. I purchased a pair of the #1340 shoes and my feet and ankles hurt. The bottom of the shoes is very hard and uncomfortable. Also the front of my feet  and toes felt like they were being compressed. I previously purchased three pairs of the #1012 shoes and they were very comfortable. The #1012 shoes were the most comfortable running shoe I ever wore. My feet never hurt when I wore the #1012 shoes. The #1012 shoes were wider in the front and they had more cushioning on the bottom of the shoes. I am returning the #1340 shoes.
Not for actual wear...  These are not sturdy AT ALL. The strap that covers the laces tore off before my son ever had a meet. One week of practice was all it took to destroy these shoes. Adidas has always been his preference but these didn't hold up for five minutes. Sad.
Bad sizing  These run fairly large. I normally wear an 11.5 in New Balance. These easily feel like a 12. So I purchased reordered a half size smaller, and they were too small. Very disappointing sizing system for this specific model. I will most likely return these.
Apparently redesigned sizing  The outer dimensions on this shoe have changed and gotten smaller.  I've run with these for many years.  Will switch to a competitor brand.  I'm very disappointed that ASIC chose to do this.  If you are used to the previous models of this shoe, bring a tape measure along to check the dimensions for yourself.
Right Shoe front assembly (toe cap) is tearing off with in a week. I did not expect this from this brand. I am going to return this product
What was Salomon thinking???  This is my 5th pair of xa pro 3d shoes.  I researched the shoe prior to purchase with indication on the salomon site that the shoe was redesigned, although I could tell from the pictures the tongue looked different from every previous model.  No problem I have used this shoe for years without any complaints, that is until now.  According to salomon support rep, who was very apologetic, they redesigned the shoe based upon feedback from an ultra runner.  Can only imagine how much money they wasted on that decision.  The arch support was altered so severe that after a three mile run my feat were in agony.  Never happened before with 4 previous pairs!  Note: I did attempt to break these in wearing them in the house for about 4 hours.  Also, the tongue contains a pouch to accommodate the quick lace after it is tightened (there is a sufficient amount of excess when tightened).  The pouch was altered and now it is almost impossible to get the lace system into the pouch after tightened!  I can't understand how a company like Salomon could take something that was functional and break it???  Did someone ever try on this shoe before production??  Unbelievable.
One of the shoes makes a really annoying and embarrassing sticky noise every time I step  One of the shoes makes a really annoying and embarrassing sticky noise every time I step. Shoes are new and clean, and it's only the right shoe. Wish I could return them, but I've worn them to the gym a few times and it's likely too late.
Don't bother  Garbage.  Try this brand it's amazing.... on cloud.... Best sneaker I've ever had this
Was too large. Returned the pair..
Wouldn't buy again!  My 9 year old son wore these shoes for only a week when the black on the toe started to wear away; and not from wearing while riding bikes, playing sports, or any other rigorous activity-just normal everyday recess and school. I would expect a lot more durability from a trail running shoe. The shoe doesn't have any actual holes in them and it's now been 4 months, but they looked like they were a year old only after a week or so.
Quality is very general
Not my favorite shoe.  The shoe feels bulky to me. I miss the feeling of contact with the ground.
The sole is separating after less than a year  I had a pair of these sneakers that I work, regulary, for 2+ years and so I bought them again.  Unfortunately, this pair is quite literally falling apart after 9 months.  I'm very disappointed as I find these quite comfortable.  A shame the workmanship is not up to par.
is not the best quality
the fabric at the top is very very bad  Excellent running shoes! The sole was not the problem. But, the fabric at the top is very very bad, which got ripped only after 1 month. Too bad! Too disappointed
Not that great of a shoe.  The picture looked way better than the actual shoe. While the fit was what I expected and was comfortable with, the quality leaves a lot to be desired. Loose threads, the sole is starting to detach from normal occasional wear. Adidas is usually a good brand, maybe I got the first shoe of the first run on a Monday morning, either way, the shoe is not made to last and I am having doubts about purchasing Adidas off of Amazon any longer.
Oder a size bigger than you normally would  Nice looking shoe, but fit like a 13 instead of 14
You must buy from Vibram to have warranty  Even with break in period, shoe style would not work for me. Vibram gives 90 day money back guarantee (if you buy off their website only). 3rd party seller only gave 50% back after only wearing a few days. I did not claim that they were new but that they were too painful to wear.
Too big!!!  Pretty nice shoe, but runs extremely big. I have the prior kanadia trail version from adidas in size 10.5- this version the size 10 was still way bigger. Beware ordering online, need to try them on.
just so so
2 stars for comfort only! Durability is poor.  2 stars for comfort only! Durability is poor.  Within a month the stylized webbing [outermost criss-cross black layer on the top region of the shoe] has pulled loose in many areas.  Structurally, the shoe seems to care less about this issue.  Though the problems do not end there.  The fabric layer is weak and generated several holes on each shoe.  I was saddened to put these shoes aside.  They just looked too tattered and unprofessional to wear around any longer. They still had good soles and good fit but when they look like a lawnmower hit them once or twice its just not acceptable.
Not recommended for long term use.  They were comfortable at first but they do not last. I walk 5+ miles a day at work on concrete. After 2 months these shoes are broken down and falling apart. Perhaps they last longer off concrete, I don't know. I do not recommend them for indoor use.
These were narrower than the 4 previous pairs that my husband has owned. We returned them. Be sure they are returnable if you try them.
Shoe shopping is a tough nut to crack online.  Request RMA and try again I guess.
Break in your heels  The heel section needs breaking in. I rubbed my heels raw on a 7 mile hike, although that may be my own fault for not packing moleskin or socks. I think I recall my last new balances needing the same heel break in. Aside from that, fantastic. Good off road mud grip. The cleat bottoms are a bit slidey on hard slick flooring though. I need to ammend. The heels just aren't breaking in at all. Other new balances are made of better softer material. This is some super strong stiff plastic. I've had them for too long now to send back. Too much faith in New Balance I guess. Spend the extra $50 and go with an MX00 or MX20 New Balance, not these. Savings is not worth it.
Not the best comfort  Comfortable in the heel and step but narrow in the toes and my right big toe is in pain.
They are incredibly light and comfortable. Personally for running shoes I opt for shoes ...  I don't use these for running shoes or other physical activity where I would put much strain on them. I mostly use them as a casual and walking shoe. They are incredibly light and comfortable.  Edited: In less than 2 months of using these for walking the side blew out near the toe. I had a pair prior where it did similar after 8 months. This isn't acceptable.
This shoe is good for running in the sand  This shoe is good for running in the sand, but when it is wet it chafes your feet rather badly.
Spikes so not fit it these shoes.  My sons coach said these were the wrong spike for cross county.  Thats not what the description said. Returned.
Smelly  Loved the shoes they were very comfortable. I'm not sure how long I wore the shoes till I started noticing a smell, and then Finally connected it to my shoe. It straight smells like cat urine! I tried washing these multiple times getting them extremely hot to get any moisture out. You name it I tried it and it still smelled horrible!!!!! For comfort I give it a 5, but for a $130 shoe to smell so bad that you have to chuck them out so early is a shame
worst shoes ever  Worst pair of shoes I have ever worn. My feet hurt terribly. Very disappointed. I would like my money back but I am sure it won't happen.
Sorry to say the left side is a size 11 1/2 when it should b size 12.  The shoes are in Guyana and it would b too difficult to return.
Nice shoe but I have low arch and these shoes have very high arch support.
Sore Feet  I recently tore my plantar fascia and have only been out of a walking boot for 2 weeks.  New Balance is recommended for people with plantar fascia problems so I went to my local New Balance store.  The salesman recommended these for comfort and stability.  In the store I noticed what felt like bumps in the insole.  He explained that those were meant to provide cushioning.  He told me I had 30 days to try them and that I could return them for any reason.  Until yesterday, I had only worn them for short periods but I realized that the over pronation protection was causing me to walk on the outside of my foot.  I thought that might be because my plantar fascia is not as strong as it should be as a result of the tear although my other shoes don't have that problem.  Yesterday, I used them for my first 30 minute walk on a treadmill and the "bumps" in the insole killed my feet.  I'll be taking them back this week.  I trusted the salesman to guide me in the right direction - this time I'm trying on a lot of shoes.
does not fit corectly.  I love New Balance shoes but this one I didn't like it. The width is too narrow. it hurts my toe. I will see if I can return it.
I would not recommend.  Low quality shoes. I would not recommend.
Doesn't fit to my son
So far so good, been training in these shoes for a couple ...  Trained with these shoes for 8 months , were great at first then the last couple of months they started to break down on the back heels to a point can no longer train with them. I have had good luck with these the last couple of pairs i purchased not sure why these broke down. I am a speed walker and sometime runner so they are not abused my any means. I purchase new shoes every year and still have 2 pairs of GT,s that did not do this.
Overpriced shoes fell apart, wore down quickly  I bought these eight months ago. They are totally worn out now. The mesh fabric above the toes has holes. The soles are like pieces of steel -- not exactly what you want to run on. I don't know if this is characteristic of ASICS, but I know I won't buy another pair from that company.
K-Swiss tubes review  I loved the look of these shoes and they were very comfortable. My biggest issue with these shoes was the tube design. There is a divider in the middle of the tubes which causes the shoes to be very unstable while running. Imagine trying to run on ice skates and you will have a general idea of the issue. The shoes were true to size and the price was reasonable. I really wanted to like these shoes but I had to go with a different running shoe instead.
terrible quality.  My first time buying this brand and they broke after 2 months, terrible quality.
GTX model does not fit the same as standard Saucony Ride  I have worn several pairs of Saucony Ride over the last few years and it has become my favorite running shoe.  I decided to try the GTX version since it was a little cheaper than the other pairs I found on the internet.  BIG MISTAKE!  I've finally realized why my feet and legs have been bothering me for the last month. These shoes are slightly smaller and narrow than the regular version of Saucony Ride!  They are also stiffer than the regular version.  I wish I had realized sooner that these shoes were not going to stretch out so I could have returned them.  I only got 6 weeks out of them.  Will never buy this model again.
Tread on bottom dirty, side of upper has worn decals  totally unacceptable! Opened a box of slightly used shoes. Tread on bottom dirty, side of upper has worn decals, and fraying Mizuno emblem. What the heck! No runner should have to endure that let-down. Very disappointed!
Disappointed  Ordered the exact same size as the pair I ordered before.  The fit on the new pair is not the same.  Not sure I can trust ordering from Amazon again.
Very disappointing. After only three months the stitching is pulling apart and the shoe is ruined.
Cheap and poorly made  My 10 year son wore this for a grand total of 8 months ... and they failed with a hole in the bottom of shoe. They are cheaply made, so have low expectations for durability. Better spent using the dollars to get something of higher quality.
Broke quickly.  Fit & look are great. My husband wears these on occasion and yet after only 8 months the front part of the shoe came off - the blue rim around the toe. He does not use them for running or any regular activity. Normally a sneaker would last him a long time. He is very disappointed that they broke so quickly considering the few times they were worn.
the logo get detached, very disappointed as a brand. No more shopping at this store.
Low Quality Manufacturing  Sole quickly de-laminated despite minimal wear/use. Bad quality assurance.
The shoes sent to me had mud on the soles. Must have been a return item.  The shoes themselves are a good product, but Amazon sent me used shoes.  I opened the box to find the shoes do look very new, except that they  had mud stuck to the bottom of them.  This must have been a return that was worn for a few days / in the mud.  The shoes are in good condition, but I expected a new item.  I have been wearing Salomon shoes for 20 years. This model appears to be a good and feels more comfortable to my flat feet than previous versions.  I will keep the shoes because I like them, but I was a little disappointed in Amazon for sending me something that was clearly a bit used and dirty.  I considered exchanging them for new pair, but it really isn't that big of a deal to me. I noticed that there are free returns, but Amazon would charge me more to exchange them.
Poor quality for the exorbitant price  The top linen started to wear out within 6 months or so. The shoe costed $100 but lasted only about 9 months after a regular use.
Cushiony shoe with a fatal flaw  I've been buying Reebok shoes for years.  Their DMX is the greatest thing since sliced bread.  I was excited to find shoes in my size on Amazon.  The shoes look a little cheap, which is OK, but the reason I sent these puppies back was because there is a plastic strip that runs across the middle of the shoe that does not stretch, thus leaving the top portion of the shoe extremely tight fitting and narrow.  The rest of the shoe was comfortable.  While it pained me to send them back, it would hurt even more to keep them.  Also, the tongue on the left shoe was separating.  Until I find another brand that matches the cushiony feel of Reebok's DMX, I'll stick with Reebok.  Just avoid this shoe.
MT710v2 not the same as MT710  I purchased a pair of MT710, some time passed, then I decided to buy a 2nd pair before the 1st ones wore out. The 2nd was the MT710v2 which I guess means the product was revised to "v2". The v2 is a completely different product. The tread is different, the support across the toes is different, and it feels very cheap and flimsy compared to the original MT710. So flimsy, that I would have thought it was a counterfeit but I bought it from Amazon, so presumably not counterfeit. I did not wear them so I returned them to Amazon. 2 stars because they might be the right product for somebody, just not me.
Customer service doesn't care and they don't stand behind their products  These shoes are amazingly comfortable and i was happy until one started hurting.  There is a defect in the heel of one. The plastic seems to be breaking down and it digs into the heel.  it is impossible to wear them without pain.  I contacted customer support numerous times as they have a warranty.  i submitted everything plus some and never get responses.  I call and they say they will take care of it and then months go by with nothing.  i'm not sure what to do.  They sell products they don't stand behind. it is a shame.  ive gone back to my Keens.
The shoes themselves were pretty great and I'm happy about wearing them  So, here's the thing. The shoes themselves were pretty great and I'm happy about wearing them. The only problem for me is that it broke. Yes, the red chips at the bottom literally broke and starting coming apart. Now, it makes a weird clicking noise when I walk because of that. That is annoying. I'm a little disappointed. I didn't expect these shoes to last one one year.
Are these shoes made of paper?  I bought these shoes and I was horribly disappointed. Much like other reviewers, my shoes began to tear on the side within a couple of months. My first pair of Minimus is still kicking, albeit with much less treat, while these have found a place in the back of the closet and will eventually find a place in the garbage. Sad because they look nice.. they're just really horribly crafted. If I had a second chance I would not buy these shoes again.
Too small  Eventhough the size we bought is the correct one, my husband cannot use this pair at all because it is too small and he feels his feet are not well supported.
Pataouchy  Great look. Poor construction
Wear out way too fast!!  Ive been running for many years and any running shoe I have owned to date lasts 10-12 months before the tread wears out.  Until I got this pair.  Only two months old and the tread is already worn down, almost worn out.  Might make it to three months if Im lucky.  This is unacceptable!  Ive owned two previous pair of Saucony brand shoes, different model, and they lasted roughly a year each.  I do not recommend the Hurricane as a running shoe.  UPDATE: Saucony as a company gets 5 stars!! Contacted Saucony directly and they are going to warranty the shoes and send me a new pair.  I must give them credit for standing behind their product.  Very professional about the whole ordeal.  I will buy more Saucony brand shoes because of their outstanding service.
Terrible
Love the idea  Love the idea, need to buy at least 1-1.5 sizes bigger than what you normally wear.  Sadly had to be returned.
Not the same as GT2000-2  These are completely different that GT2000-2. They are not very stiff and therefore not supportive for someone as tall as me (I wear size 14 I am 6-3 200 lbs). I returned them
the shoes is good,but dirty and maybe tried  the shoes is good, the left shoe is beautiful, but the right one is dirty, and maybe tried can you tell me why?
I thought cancel this did not like matrale is made of do not like how tight with is/  John Bradford
Five Stars  i was really excited but the pair i got was defected. i had to pay $35 to ship it back and still waiting for my money.such a waste of money and time. i truly regret it.
best looking and most comfortable shoes ever  sole came apart in 5 weeks and my toe pushed through the mesh. best looking and most comfortable shoes ever. had to be a bad pair
Way too narrow!!!  Ive worn ASICS for years and this style is so narrow, they had to be sent back. Even the 2E width was too narrow in the arch and toe. Not sure if I will buy this style or try something different.
nice shoe  way to tight for my sixe 14 foot,they where even 4e wide,,nice sneaker though,,,
A HUGE RIPOFF  A friend of mine turned me onto these because they had springs inside the soles. Think about this premise for a second. INSIDE the soles. Here's what the sales people will tell you: "Oh there's a 98% energy return!" Again, just roll that around for a sec. A 98% energy return? On WHAT? Firstly, you can't just squirt some laughable fake stat like that out your mouth without somehow being able to  measure whatever that is you're portending. After wearing them and using them up, the only thing you need to know about this shoe is that it is uncomfortable, overpriced, heavy and clunky. I am no nuclear physicist here, but in order to obtain any benefit from SPRINGS in or on a shoe, wouldn't they have to be, I don't know....ON THE OUTSIDE???? Then you'd just be hopscotching down the street like a KANGAROO!!  I use Adidas cross trainers and they are lightweight, comfy and great running shoes. I used them before I got suckered into buying these, got rid of these, and am back with Adidas!  This product is LUDICROUS!! Do not waste your money.
The best fit of this experience was Band Aid for Blisters..  I have the 2012 pair and couldn't be happier, but I just finished a half marathon and knew it was time to finally retire them. There was no question that I wanted these as a replacement. From the beginning, I realized the difference in fit compared to the 2012s, but chose to ignore it. I typically wear an 11, but not the case with these. The 10.5 was ALMOST too small, but the 11 was DEFINITELY too big. I really struggled with that, but decided to go with the 10.5. I also noticed the shoe was narrower than the previous models, but chose to ignore that too... until my first run (which was only about 5 miles). Sure, the bottoms of my feet felt like I was running on a cloud, but then I stopped and realized that I had a blood blister on my heel that was about the size of my thumb. The heel is so narrow it's in somewhat of a V shape. The heel support had been rubbing against me the whole time. I typically run about 25 miles a week and deal with blisters from time to time, but this was, by far, the worst one I've ever had. After dealing with that (and having less than a month to prepare for my next half), I decided to return them. These might be great to wear casually and for that I give them 2 stars, but beware of the narrow fit if you're a runner and are purchasing based on the fit of previous models.
Terrible shoe.  Uncomfortable.  Poorly made.  Squeaky to the point of stupid.  Dumbest. Shoe. Ever. The SQUEAKING ruins them. Not only is it LOUD, it gets LOUDER with wear. You will sound like an IDIOT when you wear these shoes. Inside, you can hear them at least 15 yards away. Outside, unless a bus is passing by, you still hear them when you walk. Plus, the QUALITY IS BAD. The insole on the right foot is peeling away after less than 2 months. The left is mis-shapen so that my middle toe creeps to the far left of the shoe, causing severe discomfort. Mainly, THE SQUEAKING MAKES YOU SOUND LIKE AN IDIOT. Who's that guy with the loud shoes passing me by in the hallway at school? YOU. Who's that moron whose shoes make so much noise at the gym? YOU. Who's that guy whose foot hurts b/c he tried to work out in his Sambas? YOU. I bought these so I could do martial arts, but the squeaking is just irritating and distracting (thank goodness I'm not trying to be a Ninja!), and the discomfort renders them useless in a work out after about 15 minutes. OH, and did I mention that the stylish and slick blue Adidas tag on the tongue disappears as the tongue rides down to the inside of the shoe, rendering the logo invisible and the shoes even more uncomfortable?
Poor Quality Control?  I've used Saucony Hurricane shoes for almost 10 years, because they always left a little extra room in the toe box. All the posts about this year's model being too small are true.  My shoes weren't just more than snug. They were TIGHT against the front and inside of my toe.  Huge disappointment, Saucony. I'll have to switch to another manufacturer this year.
Very narrow shoes
It is narrow not roomy like other 4E shoes  It is narrow not roomy like other 4E shoes; not enough cushion in-front. It make my feet hurt bad.
Holy crap, these fell apart quickly.
Not sized up  They run about a half size to small .maybe I needed 2E instead of DM size!
Tight fit
The heel came apart within a few months!
The back of the heel started cutting in and my heel bled at about 2 weeks. Poor construction. I love Saucs and moved on to a new shoe.
Be aware  Arch in left shoe was 2inchs forward than arch in right shoe... Disappointed
I can NOT get my toes inside and must return them.
Not the same as other NB 9.5 wide shoes!  I'm hoping these shoes will stretch out a bit.  My feet are sore after a few hours of jamming into these.
I got the wrong size, I ordered a Size 81/2 and I got a Size 11 now I gotta return it "Disliked"!!
I ordered the size I would normally wear for this shoe.  They were too small.  Go into a store.
They fall apart...  This shoe is okay. Unfortunately, after only two months of use, they have rips in the sides of each shoe and the eye holes for the laces have begun ripping out. What is with these shoes?  DO NOT BUY.
Much narrower than other Sauconys Ive owned!  First pair of sauconys that didn't fit my foot! They were too narrow and it felt like my heal was going to slip over the side of the shoe. Bought them to play tennis but was afraid I would twist my ankle so I sent them back.
Excellent shoe but my toe on each side wears a hole on the top of the shoe. Yes my nail is cut, but this has happened to four pair of these shoes. I buy two at a time when I like them no more though.
shoes size was small
Not good quality.  Feels like a sock with a sole.
Size Runs Small!  Not the same shoe!  I have a pair of Stinson Tarmac and attempted to replace with this shoe.  Same size shoe was about a CM shorter and narrower.  Did not have the soft cushion of the original.  Had to return them and will start the search anew.
I would not recommend these shoes  I buy Asics for the support of the shoe.  The soles of the shoe are already breaking down, and there is no support now.  The tips of the soles are coming apart from the shoe.  This is a very inferior product from Asics.  I have been buying Asics for several years, and never had a problem.......until now.  I would not recommend these shoes.  Customer service for the company never responded to email.  I would not use this company as well.
Unexpectedly too narrow  This is my fifth or sixth pair of New Balance 574s.  The look and build of them are, unsurprisingly, high quality. Unfortunately, however, the shoes are a bit narrow in the toe box.  I love New Balance for many reasons, but most important of all is (was?) their consistency in sizing.  Buying in a size EE always gave me a great fit even right out of the box.  Unfortunately, my toes are still cramped.  I'll try to wear them in and hopefully the toe box expands.  If not, I'll have to return them.  UPDATE: shoe is till too narrow.  I tried stretching them for two years and found that I just didn't enjoy wearing them at all, they were so narrow and uncomfortable.  Of all my shoe purchases, this is the one I deeply regret.
Caused Achilles Tendinitis  So I have had maybe 5 to 7 pairs of Kayano 17's, and loved them all.  They were the perfect shoe for me.  I have also tried other shoes on occasion, but always went back to the Kayano 17's.  I am a triathlete and had just started to really get into the hard training about a month ago when I bought these shoes.  They felt comfortable enough, but about a week into it I started getting pain in my Achilles tendon.  Ran in them for 2 more weeks and it got so bad that I couldn't walk so I completely stopped.  About 3 weeks with no running later (talk about a horrible break from training), I got back out there.  I did a race, with no running training and wore my racing sneakers (Newtons) and felt great.  I put on my new Kayano 18's again and after about 10 steps my Achilles started hurting again, what?  you have to be kidding me.  I ran about a tenth of a mile and it just kept getting worse.  I walked home and switched shoes to my old Kayano 17's.  Guess what, no pain.  I did the entire 3 mile run pain free and my ankle still feels fine the next day.  I don't know what it is about these shoes that caused my pain, but I'm not wearing them again.  These were the biggest waste of money and now I have to find a new shoe since they don't make the 17's anymore.  This sucks.  On a side note, I'm sure I'm a rare case, but Asics may have just lost me as a customer.
No es seguro comprarle es informal
Defect because poor manufacturing after less than two months  Defect because poor manufacturing after less than two months the rubber at the bottom of the shoes start Cut off because bad paste I have photoes and I want send it
TOO NARROW  Ordered a 13 4E.  No where near that width. Nice shoe, poor sizing. Returned.
El calzado tiene desperfectos ambos lados como se puede ver en las fotos. Inaceptable para un producto nike costoso.
Purchased at a physical store. Not a durable shoe.  I do a great deal of walking at work, and spend a lot of time on my feet. I was looking for a lightweight shoe with good cushioning and air flow for the summer months.  This shoe was all those things, and is probably the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn, but sadly I will never buy another pair.  For the price, the durability of these shoes is terrible. They were never abused, and after less than two months of normal daily wear, the soles were COMPLETELY smooth. I was slipping on dry pavement, they were a major safety hazard. I called k-swiss and they had me send them in to be looked at.  They deemed it to be a manufacturing issue, and sent me a new pair in the mail. The new pair had a stiffer sole, but they still offered the same comfort as the first pair.  Again, after 4 months, smooth soles, and dangerous slipping. To add to that, around the 3 month mark, the section of the heel where the two colors meet had completely separate. It was like walking on a flat tire. It was causing me back and ankle pain, and the squeaking created by the two sections rubbing together was unbearable. Other people were complaining about the noise, it was that loud.  I will never buy a another K-swiss product. a pair of runners under the same circumstances, and use patters last me well over a year of daily wear. After that they are still comfortable and get retired to wearing while running around doing errands are yard work. The other shoes I've worn were Nike, as well as Adidas. They may not have been pillow soft to walk on, but I would much rather have marginally less comfortable shoes that last for more than 2-3 months.
Embarrassing.  Noisiest (creaky, squeaky, quacky) shoes I have ever worn! Only willing to wear them outside. Truly ridiculous.
Very dissappointed  These shoes were supposedly 10.5/4E.  They were not even close in terms of length or width.  I feel certain that they were marked incorrectly.  Buying shoes online is not at all easy.
Used shoes  While I love the shoes, they came to me used. Not old, but definitely had been worn. The soles were dirty. Pretty disappointed.
Too small for me!  I normally wear size 8 and ordered that size. When I tried them on, they were too small and tight in the toe box. Didn't get a chance to try'em out and don't think it's fair to have to give them a star rating.
I LOVE ASICS SNEAKERS  I LOVE ASICS SNEAKERS, ITS ALL I EVER WEAR.  SADLY THIS PAIR IS TOO WIDE IN THE FRONT, THE LACES ARE RIDICULOUSLY LONG AND THE EYE HOLES DON'T INCLUDE THE LOWER HOLE FOR MORE ANKLE SUPPORT.  PLUS THE MESH FEELS TOO LOOSE AND UN-SUPPORTING. WOULD HAVE RETURNED THEM BUT NEEDED THEM FOR A 5 K RUN.
Do Not Buy If You have Truly Wide Feet or Hammertoes!!  I could Not Believe that these were supposed to be a True 4E Width!! They Fit more like a 2E!!! If you other Foot issues like High Arches, Need to wear Ankle Braces or Have Hammer Toes in which You Need Volume, along with Width...Do Not Buy these Shoes!!!   I will Hopefully find someone who Can wear these at a Lower price from Me!! Sorry, New Balance, but Some of your Products have Soured on me and My Poor Feet!!!
Women's not men's.  It says "Nike Men's Flex..." but they are women's shoes and of course were too small.
Thick sole, heavy shoe.  A Minimus it is not.  I'm a serious road runner, and I have very wide feet.  This leaves me with few options.  New Balance 4E width shoes have always served me well.  A few years ago I tried the minimalist MX20 after >10 mile runs began hurting my knees.  Magic happened.  After a month of adapting to the new stride (i.e. mid-foot striking rather than heel striking), my knee problems vanished.  Minumus to the rescue!  Time passed, the shoe wore out as all shoes do.  I came back to Amazon to find a replacement.  I bought this one because it doesn't have the reinforcing strap across the top of the toe box, which restricts my foot when running.  However, the 1690 is not comparable to other Minimus shoes.  It is much thicker in the sole, heavier, and more biased toward the "traditional" running shoe heel-strike stride.  The 1690 product description on Amazon is not thorough, so I'm writing this for others who may think as I did that this 1690 is a minimalist shoe.  It ain't so.  As always, Amazon made it painless (and free!) to return, so that was nice.
Absolute garbage  I've owned NB tennis shoes previously and been pleased. I compete at a high level and expect a lot from my shoes.  When I saw these at this price, I figured I'd scored big time.  NB have shot themselves in the foot by offering this shoe. It's absolute garbage. The quality is so poor that the tops of your feet and toes get roughed up by the very low quality material.  It doesn't seem to fit the shape of the foot either and you notice this immediately when you start playing in them.  Prior to this, I would've said NB made top quality tennis shoes and you couldn't go wrong with the brand. Apparently no longer the case...
Too narrow  Bought a 2E and it feels like a narrow! Had to return.
Not correct size
I was very disappointed with these  After purchasing several pairs of Hoka shoes, I was very disappointed with these.  The fit is large and no matter what kind of socks I use my feet slide inside the shoe.  What a waste of $100.
Walking shoe  This shoe ran very narrow and was not comfortable. The shoe was very unforgiving when running. The shoe laces were cheap and broke after a month of wear.
Good shoe  I knew that these shoes run .5 too small so I ordered appropriately. Super comfy and light. Love aggressive soles. Use them for golf. Love them
the style I love has been discontinued and this was the replacement  I've had a few pair...the style I love has been discontinued and this was the replacement.  The old ones fit like a glove...these...not so much.  More like swim flippers.
Narrow fit, blown out sides  I like the look of the shoes a lot. It's tough to get something understated design-wise, and this worked for me.  Fit was longer and more narrow than I expected. I sometimes take size 11, sometimes 11.5. Very rarely 10.5, never twelve. And my feet are pretty classically "normal" width. So 11.5D should work, I thought.  They came and they felt a little snug on the side of the both forefeet, and also felt a little long. But I decided to keep them because I thought they were close enough.  So I don't know whether it was because they were a tiny bit snug (and thus I could be a tiny bit to blame) but both shoes quickly blew out on the sides roughly where the foot is the widest. It's a very loose and light kind of wonder fabric, but it split like gauze after pretty light use.  I mean they still look brand new.
Shoes to small
CAT STINK ISSUE - 2ND PAIR NOW!!!  I've owned two pairs of 993s and both were victims of the "CAT URINE STENCH". The first pair I left out overnight and they got wet with dew. After they started stinking, I naturally assumed that a cat had got to them. Eventually, I had to replace them. When the second pair began to smell horrible also, I was scratching my head because no animals had access to them. Nevertheless, I ordered another pair from a local retailer. I was on my way to pick them up when I decide to check the price on Amazon and saw all the other people who are having this same problem. I immediately called New Balance customer support and they were quite well aware of the problem; however, they offered nothing but a $20 gift certificate towards another pair of NB shoes. In my opinion, they need to solve this problem and then issue a recall, replacing the defective shoes. They won't have any trouble identifying them.  What a shame - they give Made In USA a bad name.
Super disappointed, should not happen that  Soles of running shoes broke. Padding ripped off after 50 miles logged. Super disappointed, should not happen that soon
The inner sole did not seem to be made for the shoe.  The inner sole moved around on both shoes.  Very annoying and had to adjust every few mins.  Within a couple days of buying them I super glued the inner soles to the shoe itself.  They still don't feel as they should.
Ok shoe  This shoe had awesome tread on the bottom, and I used them for a little running and hiking, but I didn't like the feel on the inside. Not comfortable at all, and if they get wet they take two or three days to dry out.
I am normally a size 11.5 but these were tight and I needed a 12.
Ordered men's 10 it was about 1/2 to 1 full size to small.  Did not order replacement since they were about $40 more to go from 10 to 10.5
Don't waste your money  I have changed my rating from a 5 to a 1.  This is because after only 3 months of using this pair of shoes, the sole on the right shoe was completely worn out.  There is a hole in it, my foot is literally touching the ground and it's extremely painful.
The toe-box seemed narrower than previous versions of this shoe.  I've been wearing other versions of the Gel-Kahana for about 5 years.
not great  This design doesn't offer much support on the sides, soles a little squishy. not great for running.
Not happy with these shoes at all  I bought these shoes in part because of the great reviews here but these are incredibly uncomfortable shoes for me. The cushioning is terrible along with the heal support. I don't understand why these shoes have such great reviews.
My first pair fit great, but my second pair keeps cutting into my heel.
Shoes were returned
4E Not Wide Enough  I had a pair of Kahana 7's size 11 4E's that were great. they were very comfortable and i wore them forever. I bought these in a size 10.5 because that's the actual size i wear and they are way too tight.  Had to return them.
SIZE IS TOO SMALLER THAN OTHER BRAND ...
Size is much smaller than actual label stated  Friendly speaking , it's quite bad impression for the size of this shoe. Much smaller than actual size stated on label. Beside this, i quite love this shoe. Comfortable and light.
Tried but didn't work  I have worn New Balance for years, as they are one of the few that have the extra wide width. I have had several pair of the  MR1012. First shoe with extra room in the toe box that felt good. I have neuropathy in my feet from back issues. When I found the 1012 I was thrilled. But sadly they are no longer made, so, tried this shoe, as it was advertised as roomier toe box. Didn't work for me, not the same. So, unfortunately I had to return them.
Very narrow 4E  This shoe is not nearly as wide as my other NB 4E.  Disappointed in this shoe.
Comfortable but already seems to be falling apart.  Shoes are already feeling a bit flimsy for not even having over 2 months. Incredibly comfortable but not sure how long these will last.
Size is not same as the previous version of Zealot, toebox is tight and I got serious blisters. Would not recommend it if you were happy with Zealot original try finding it instead of ISO 2.  The inside pad stained my running compression socks, the light green color runs.
Run small  Sent back
Not enough support!  Shoes hurt my over pronation feet. I really wish you made the gel Rebel Asics again.
Awful  Saucony claims that if you are a consistent concrete runner these are the shoes for you. The first time I ran with these on concrete they felt unforgiving. I instantly got shin splints and I've never had shin splints in my life. I bought them to fix my bad knee problems, but all they did was add more pain. They may be the worst running shoes I've ever had.
4E is too narrow.  Should have listened to other reviewers.  Those with wide feet stay away.  I hate to say it, but all of the reviews saying that the width is different than expected from New Balance are correct.  These are narrower (9.5, 4E) than their predecessors by a good amount. A 4E should not hurt my feet and these do.  Otherwise, the quality seems about right for a cheaper shoe.  If the width was good, I would have given 5 stars.  That said, does anyone have recommendations for shoes that don't break the bank, look decent, and fit those with wide feet?
You get what you pay for ....  I'm a dog walker in New York City.  The soles of these were completely shredded in less than a month.  Additionally, the left shoe was sewn differently than the right shoe (wasn't machined correctly?) and that made the left shoe start to fall apart in less than 2 weeks of use.
Fit is small and very narrow  I generally wear a 10.5 in Nike and knew that Salomon shoes run a bit small, so I  ordered a size 11.  My toes were pushing in the end of the toe box, and I was astonished at how VERY narrow they are.  I am sure this would be a great shoe if you have narrow feet and ordered them at least a size and a half larger than you normally wear.
disappointed  I am pretty disappointed - I was chomping at the bit waiting on my new shoes, only to not be able to wear them. The heel bed is rather narrow, the pinkey toe area rubbed my toe to the point of where I would have gotten a blister had I worn them for an extended period - not to mention running. All around, not very comfortable - so, I'll keep wearing my old ones.
Nice, but not for me  I ordered these after reading other reviews about how comfy these shoes are.  In specific, I was interested in reviews which indicated these were comfortable to wear for people with achilles tendon problems since I currently am recovering from such an injury.  When I received them and tried them on I was dismayed to find that the top of the heel pressed into my achilles, causing discomfort.  If I were to wear them regularly the shoes would doubtlessly have aggravated the existing injury.  Otherwise, the shoes fit fine.  They felt a little odd to walk in, though, since they felt like they were pronating as I walked.
Run Small  I like most new balance shoes. But when I order a 12.5 EE all of the NB should be the same size in the inside. These run small. I give 2 stars to NB in general for their inconsistent sizing. The shoes would get 4 stars if they would fit like the 12.5 EE Tennis shoes by NB
I am waiting for Christmas to see if they fit my son.
The boa system is not reliable - easily detach  The boa system in these shoes keeps coming off... My Under Armour Fat Tire Boa's system is so much better than this one...
Do NOT buy!!!  My 11-year-old son wears these daily.  He does what 11-year-old boys do.  He plays.  He should be able to play in these pricey sneakers without them falling apart before our very eyes 6 weeks after the initial purchase.  There are several holes in the mesh, but not even necessarily at standard shoe stress points.  Instead, right in the middle of the instep and near the arch the material is literally falling apart.  Despite the unique and very nice styling of these shoes, use your money elsewhere.
Shoe sizing inconsistent  Have been using this brand, this exact size for years, these shoes are a size smaller than normal, really disappointed
Not what I expected  My husband and I found it impossible to insert the id card into the ID folder.  There were no instructions included. In addition, we feel it was highly overpriced.
Sole peels off!  Poor quality!  Shoes were great for 2 months, but then the sole on my right shoe started peeling off.  Very poor quality!!! I contacted Nike, and they said since its bought through an Amazon seller, and not the Nike authorized store, they can't help me!
Right shoe smaller than left  Left shoe was perfect, right shoe appear strobe a size 9 labeled as size 9.  Annoying!!!  Now I have to waste time with return - I need new shoes!
but I have tried them on a tread mill and I do not find them comfortable and no support what so ever  I wear these for playing wally ball and playing racket ball.  The shoe material is to flexible.  There is no support, no matter how tight I tie the shoes. I know they say running shoes, but I have tried them on a tread mill and I do not find them comfortable and no support what so ever.  I would not recommend these shoes.  I gave these shoes 2 stars only for the fact that my feet do sweat and the material is most definitely breathable.
Not "Wide" as advertised  Sold as Wide is misleading. This shoe is more narrow than a D width. Unfortunately few brands carry a true Wide or E width.
Lace Holder broke of after 1 week  Comfortable shoe with a fabulous sole for gripping. Hugely disappointed when the lace holder broke after just one week. It appears the eyelets are just riveted in and the metal is a very poor pot metal. I have used other quick tie mechanisms that use the existing reinforced holes in the shoe itself that have lasted the life of the shoe. Great concept but poor execution of the actual product.
NOT A BARGAIN/ waste of $  bought Asics a number of times in the past. NEVER again will i buy these. garbage. very wide in front and after 2 run/walks hiking i can tell these will not last long. again run large. all the way around. sometimes you get what you pay for. not a bargain at all just a waste of money.
I received the wrong colorvery disappointed. Too much money to get the wrong color
After like ten miles I really hurts under arch area  After like ten miles I really hurts under arch area. And to pointed when hiking down hill toes bottom out. Painfully
I really hate his brand  I returned a different Ecco for these and I don't know. I really hate his brand. The left shoe hurts the top of my foot when I walk but the right one is fine. If i was not going offshore in less then 10 days i would have returned these as well. I am going to wear thicker socks and see if that works. Stay way from this brand.  I just noticed something. The other Ecco shoes i had were made in Thailand and these are in china. I guess they do lowest bid?
DO NOT BUY  This shoe ripped an eye in less than 3 months. Very disappointed. Less than 200 miles on them and they rip like this. Will never purchase again! Cheaply made! I've never had this happen with any other brand Saucony, Brooks, Nike, or Adidas.
Forward Blessings  Way to small and I could not even do anything till the following Monday. I planned to have them on the date they arrived. NO SUCH Luck! So I gifted them to a local church.
To big  Ordered size I normally wear but these were too large.
I have had these shoes for 1 hour and I agree with most of the negative and mid-grade reviews. Narrow in the toe, heel cup cushion hurts the ball of my heel, Left shoe does not seem to match the right one (Left shoe  feels lower than the right & right shoe is narrower, and it feels like I am walking on a plain rubber sole (Not Gel) that I get @ Big 5 for $20 ). "I WILL BE RETURNING THESE! "
Used shoes  Shoes were used! Smelled of cologne and laces still tied upon opening.
v2 = big changes  I have every colorway of the original New Balance MT20 b/c I love them. I was excited for the v2 b/c of the Vibram sole, but the fit is quite a bit different  - the v1's are some of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn but these just feel cheap and have a lot of internal pressure points. I had to send them back b/c I knew they weren't going to live up to the original.
Felt too narrow for the size. I returned these shoes. I much prefer the creation 17s
A step backwards from the 2130's  I got these shoes after using the GT-2130's for a year.  They fit the same, but after using them for a couple of months, I'm back to my older 2130's.  It seemed like everytime I ran with the 2140's, my knees hurt.  Yeah, my knees aren't great anyhow, but I never had pain with the 2130's that I do with the 2140's.  They just transmit more shock to your body for some reason.  It's hard to figure out, but one day I can use my 2130's and feel great, and the next day use the 2140's and feel like crap.  Also, the sole seemed to wear down a lot faster than the 2130's.  So, I am back to searching Ebay for 2130's and stocking up on them.
Paid for new received USED  Upon first opening the shipping box, I noticed the inner shoe box was crushed with several torn places on the top lid of the box itself. In addition, a hand tied plastic strap was tied around the box to keep it shut! After opening the shoe box itself, I noticed he shoe laces were not tied properly as from the factory and inside the shoes someone had replaced the factory cardboard inserts with wadded up tissue paper! Inspecting the soles revealed dirt imbedded in the lugs further confirming Amazon had sold and shipped a USED (not even cleaned) pair of shoes for the price of a brand new pair. Upon contacting CS, the agent offered to replace the pair and have me print a UPS label and drop off the return at my local UPS store further costing me time and gas. Plus, she said it is fully acceptable for Amazon to ship new and used items form their website...Hello!! Please let me speak to a supervisor, the supervisor immediately credited my account for the price of the shoes and issued a UPS pick up to save me the added expense of dropping off the box at my UPS store. End of story...Amazon could have given me a small store credit for my hassle but none was offered....I'll have to really think about that prior to ever purchasing anything else from them.
And they hurt my arches.
Different colour of the product  Dear Amazon. I did have a big problem with this product. At the website, the colour of the shoes is described as "Hasta-Sunbust-Neutral Grey". But it ain't truth. The shoes that i have in my house right now is GREEN. And it is awful, by the way!!! I'd like to send you a picture to show it to you the exactly colour of the product!! Or, the photos at Amazon's website are TOTALY, i mean, TOTALY different as they should be. I am very angry about that. I payed more that one hundred dollars for a green shoes that i thought it was GREY, like the photos!
Too small  The shoes look great but as too small/tight for me.
these shoes are super cute! however that is the only thing they have going for them :( they are soooooo tight. tight width-wise and tight length-wise. I usually wear between a 7.5 and 8 so I got a size 8. My feet are not super skinny thin but they aren't wide either. I could barely put my foot into the shoe! Wearing really thin socks too. I had to loosen the laces quite a bit. then when I did get my foot in the shoe itself isn't deep enough inside. I don't know if this makes sense but the "walls" on the shoe need to be higher so your foot sits in the shoe deeper. Because the back heel was so short it buckled so if I had worn these any longer they'd probably slip off anyways. I am bummed but they're getting returned tomorrow. I'd say these would be good for someone with really REALLY thin feet and order a size up.
Too small
size stated was like a size smaller  not for me, size stated was like a size smaller, narrow and not much toe room, not comfortable, perhaps with a good correct fitting they would be decent, I've had other asics shoes that were great, this particular model did not meet that criteria, a question about comfort I could not wear these for 5 minutes, and hour or less is a generous answer
New Balance? Really?  I run about 25 miles a week, so I need a real running shoe (not a pretty pair for walking the mall). As a runner with wide feet, I have been a loyal New Balance customer for years. They rock. However, I was stunned when I put these on and could feel the nubs of the treads pushing in on the balls of my feet. The last and cushion appears to be made of very thin, structurally insignificant material. These would destroy my feet within a week. Never fear, I bought another pair of New Balance that were up to standards, but this pair is like some sort of counterfeit you might buy in a third-world street market.
The sole of the shoe came apart after three runs Cheap shoe
The sole coming off the right shoe.  I will never purchase another pair of sketchers.
Good looking, but cheap and ripped quickly  I wanted to love these shoes. They look sporty and were perfectly comfortable. However, only 10 days into wearing them, the upper ripped in a horizontal direction on both shoes, near the pinkie toes. Not just a little hole, like a two-inch rip.  I continued to wear them anyway, but it was embarrassing to be seen in tattered rags when I actually spent a good amount of money on what should have been decent shoes. Now that I've replaced them with a pair of Brooks, I don't wear them at all.
Terrible redesign, not at all like 2170  I have been buying the Asics Gt-21.... line since the 2140 and they were all great. Each new version was basically the same. This new GT-2000 version is a totally different shoe and for those that liked the 2170, it is just awful. It offer no stability, my foot now lurches inward with each step and my knees really hurt.  And the color options are just awful. There is not mroe simple black or Blue/White options, just neon craziness.  And don't bother looking at the new GT-1000 series, they have the same awful design and every pair I saw at DSW had defects.  After spending thousands of dollars onthe GT-21... series over the years, Asics has lost me as a customer forever.
Beware of peeling soles. Do not purchace.  Same issue as previous reviewer.. ..I only wear these at the gym ..never outside once. The sole is peeling on both shoes.
Have only ran in these for about 2 months, and there is a large hole in the toebox. First and last pair of Mizunos I'll buy.
Wrong size chart in amazon  Size chart in amazon is wrong it states 11.5 us-m is 28.5 cm but is 29.5 cm
Tim's review  Shoe in good shape. Not a good feel. would not buy again.  In fact I gave them to the Good Will.
COUNTERFEIT, DO NOT BUY!  These shoes do not match the pictures on the website. They're fake, appear used or refurbished.
Have had several pair of GoRun Sketchers. This pair was at least one size too large.
No longer a great product.  I have been purchasing Hurricane Grid running shoes for well over 10 years.  The Hurricane 15 is junk for the purpose I intended.  From the Hurrican 12 to the 15, the arch support has gone from robust and firm to spongelike.  I had shin splints from running in soft shoes and went to Hurricane Grid shoes which eliminated my issue.  Using the Hurricane 15's causes pain again.  I went back to an older version and had no problems...except there are no more of the old Hurricane's available.  Time to find a different shoe.
... even a month just go down and buy some nice water shoes these are just not worth the money  first pair lasted longer but the new pare just is falling apart the rubber is just separating won't last probably even a month  just go down and buy some nice water shoes these are just not worth the money
Horrible. Fell apart after a few months of light use
The air thing is a waste of money.
Tight fit. Firm insole.  Update: Had to return the shoes.  Too tight and insole was too firm. Didn't provide the same comfort and support as my Kayano 21 shoes. Hurt my feet.  Original review: Nice looking shoe. I got this to replace my Kayano 21 running shoes that were chewed up by our parrot.  Was going to get another pair of Kayano 21 shoes but couldn't find the colors I liked in my size.  It's been less than a week since I got them but they seem fine.  Not as comfortable as my Kayano 21s but I'm still breaking them in so that might change.
Fit tight
Not the quality that I'd expect from Columbia. They seemed very cheap and poorly made.  I had to return them after wearing them one weekend.
Dissatisfied with these shoes as, after about eighteen miles in a week, my left tendon was completely inflamed.
Had to return  I had to return these. Even though they were the size I always order in a running shoe, with each step the heel felt as if it were about to slip off/loose.
Didn't like the backless feature  Returned for credit same day as received. Didn't like the backless feature.
Worst trail shoe ever, NO traction on wet ground  These were my first Saucony trail shoes and I bought my first pair at my local running store where they have never steered me wrong in 15 years of buying trail running shoes.  They were comfortable, had excellent support for my running posture and, with Vibram soles, I thought I'd get a little longer tread wear than my last pair of Brooks.  They were great for the first three miles I tried them at home on a dry Colorado road and trail.  I found black ones here on Amazon just prior to a long trip to Peru and decided to get a second pair in that color since they could double as less noticeable travel shoes than the brightly colored ones bought locally.  Big mistake!  The first day in Cusco was rainy and I nearly fell a dozen times on the steep cobblestone streets.  It was like wearing moss covered shoes.  I thought that they might improve with a little wear and since I had no other choice I wore them to Machu Picchu and actually fell twice after slipping on wet stones climbing Cerro Machu Picchu.  I have never slipped and fallen in ANY trail shoe in nearly 20 years of trail running.  Three weeks of wearing them every day and they did not improve at all on wet surfaces, no matter if it was cobble, rocks or concrete.  I am returning them and trying some other brand.  BUYER BEWARE!!
Not the typical New Balance  I wonder if NB is going down hill.  I've always worn NB because they are well shaped and really fit my feet.  Also construction has been solid.  These shoes are different.  They seem boxy and flimsy.  Also, mine were marked 4E but really were more like 2E or E, showing a lack of quality control.  I have the 750 V1 model.  I plan to return them. I'll be switching to another brand until NB gets back on track.
no tongue  The shoe has no tongue.  The body of the show wraps completely around the top and what should be the tongue is an integral part of the body.  I have high arches and when the laces are eased out, the body still can not open far enough to insert my foot.  (My mouth has a tongue so getting my foot there is a regular occurrence.) I don't hate the shoe (per the one star comment that I cannot change), but it is not wearable on my feet.
Shoes are very long. Order a size smaller than normal.
Awful  These were terrible- the heel cup protruded through the inside of the shoe and is rubbing my sons ankle. I have been searching for how to return for a refund and there is no info. They were only 6 months old!!!
Just terrible  I r
Tearing at the seams in three months.  I've turned in a claim with asics but the upper on the shoes tore in three months. I'm not rough on shoes.  I'm not a runner. I only go to the gym and lift weights then I change into dress shoes. The lighter asics don't seem to hold up.
Warning, they run really really small.  I have been buying New Balance shoes my entire life and have never had a pair that did not fit. Take warning from the other post, these shoes run extremely small. Not sure if they are bootlegged or what but they in no way seemed like legit New Balance shoes.  On the posituve side the company did issue a full refund upon return.
I have the mizuno wave creation and I quite like them.  This is my first purchase of the enigma and I find them uncomfortable for running within the first 3 miles.  It is primarily around the left forefoot and left great toe.  This may not be a problem if you are a heel striker.  I would not buy the enigma again while I am likely to buy the wave creation again.
last three months before seams come out  They look good,fit nice but after three months the seams stated to come undone. Unfortunately there is only a 30 day return window so we are stuck with them.
Fall a part after 3 weeks  Fall a part after 3 weeks and Amazon does not accept returns.
wear out fast
Doesn't Fit Like a Women's Running Shoe  I've been a New Balance wearer for many years, mostly because they're one of the few companies that makes running shoes in larger women's sizes. While I have a larger foot -- I wear a women's size 13 -- I don't have an especially wide foot, which makes trying to wear men's shoes uncomfortable. These New Balance running shoes fit exactly like a men's shoe, and don't have the quality that I'm used to with New Balance shoes. There is little support (the outer feels flimsy), too much room in the toe box (both length and width), and I have to cinch my laces so tight that both sides of the shoe meet in the middle, just to have it fit my medium width foot.
I think these were seconds...  There was a small hole noticed in the shoes, that was noticed the first day they were worn. It had to have been there upon receipt.  Due to the strict return policy, I now own a pair shoes with small hole that wa repaired with superglue.
seemed like knockoff.  Wasn't what was pictured...seemed like knockoff...
The shoes arrived in yellow and black and weren't at all as pictured.
Unfortunally They arrive damaged and  They arrived damage and aufoutunally now I am in other country so I can not returned it. For the price they are ok, very light weight
Shoes don't fit.  10 D is my size and the size of the shoes I purchased.  I have other minimalist shoes that are fine.  I've been running for 25+ years including marathons and ultramarathons.  Of all the shoes I've ever owned, this pair is the worst.
Arrived in poor condition  Sneakers were crushed because they were haphazardly thrown into the shoebox which was damaged on all sides!  These were a gift for my son and now I have to give them to him in poor condition!
Katana 21 Tooo Small. Beware  Sizing is significantly smaller than the Kayano 19 pair I have been wearing routinely for over two years. Love the 19. Bought a 11.5 in the 19s in lieu of my normal 11D.  Would like to know what the size fudge factor is on late versions.
Rubber Sole Peeled off  First pair of shoes I ever owned that actually broke! The blue rubber on the bottom has all peeled off in only a month of light use. I only use them occasionally for light walks around the neighborhood. Nothing too rigorous.
these shoes run way too small and I tried them out too late to return. not i'm out $107
Saucony ruined a good shoe  I bought three pairs of last year's hurricanes, so you can tell my disappointment. This year's model is incredibly narrow, especially in the midfoot. It also runs about half inch shorter this year. The support on this shoe also seems to be increased for someone who is a max overpronator. The shoe is also really stiff. Just a bummer.
Inside material wears away after about a month  Shoe is very comfortable with great heel cushioning. I run about 5 miles a night and they feal great with a smooth transition from heal to toe. I gave them 2 stars because after about a month the material on the inside of the shoe, up against the heal, started wearing away which leads to irritation where it contacts your foot. If you run long enough, it will rub and remove skin. So now I have to wear real thick socks with a bandaid.
Terrible upgrade from the MTv3  When i purchased and started using the Minimus MTv3, it changed my running experience completely. From day one, there was no more shin, calf pain. The control, feel and the lightness of the MTv3 was just beautiful. I never had shin pain a single day in the one and hf years i used those shoes. And im not the only one. I know people who swear by the v3 and use it for road and trail running. Durability was another great attribute to that shoe. when it came time to replace it ( coz of the tread finally wearing off) , i couldn't find the shoe anymore.  Instead I found the MTv4! Completely different shoe. Why was the design completely changed is beyond me. The fit is terrible.  the toe end of the foot is too tight on one side and keeps sliding on the other side. I wish NB would bring back the v3 design. Ive wasted $100+ on the v4 and its good for nothing for me but walking. If you guys know where i can find NB Minimus MTv3 in size 9.5D anywhere , pls lemme know. I'll probably get 2 pairs to last me a while. and Please NB , bring back the old design ..it really works!
Too small, I need return email
Not sized accordingly, to small.  Expired date to return.  Not happy
Upset with purchase  Shoes bottom treads came apart within three months on both shoes. I have always bought Vasque products but I'm not pleased with shoes at all. I've bought cheap shoes that have lasted a lot longer then these.
Cheap plastic material  These shoes are made of cheap plastic. They made my husbands feet bleed. Can no longer get a refund. Worst $120 spent ever. Shoes do not even deserve 1 star
Five Stars  Ordered January-Perfect upgrade to my Ride 7's. Loved the green  4/11/6 Well after only 30 Miles, 25 on treadmill and 5 on the road;the bottom is completely falling apart. Missing Treads and pieces pealing off. Very Very Very disa
Updates ruined quality  I had an old pair of these runners for years. I ran down to camp from half dome in them, hiked through mud, snow, and in very harsh sonoran desert trails. After a few years the thread got shaved down enough that I had to get a new pair to regain grip. This new pair is falling apart after just a few months. The sole is detaching in the front, and they never went in water, or were used particularly harsh. I am very disappointed by them.
Wore out quick.  Bought these for my son. He does parkour professionally. They were great at first because they allowed freedom of movement and excellent grip. But after only 3 months, they exploded on the sides of the shoe because the mesh fabric is not very strong at all. Way too expensive for how long they lasted.
Eh...  I'm not a fab of the tongue being connected to the shoes. It makes it hard to properly lace up. They look great though.
Faulty treads  I'm a faithful Saucony running shoe buyer and the 9.0 tread wore out in less than three months on the heels well into the second layer when I normally get 6 mos. on a shoe.  I think the sole was defective or too soft and I don't trust the 9.0 now.  I'm going back to 8.0 which I have never had a problem with.  The 9.0 was also more narrow.
Item not as expected material used looks and feels cheap and you can see the glue that binds the base of the shoe
Mine fell apart.  I liked these, but the sole started falling off after a couple months.
DON'T BUY UNLESS YOU HAVE TRIED IN STORE OR HAVE OWNED BEFORE! POOR DESIGN/MANUFACTURING  Horrible representation of an American-made product. Within 20 minutes of wearing this shoe, I developed severe blisters on my arches. The design and manufacturing are sub-standard. I immediately felt a bump in my right arch area. I thought it would level off, but it ended up causing a very bad blister on my arch. A very sad state of affairs in US sneaker manufacturing. They charge top dollar and give you absolute garbage.
"Normal" feet, may be fine, but 4E not wide enough in the forefoot OUTsole for me  RETURNED. After walking just a few feet inside the house, I could tell the forefoot OUTsole isn't wide enough for me.  It is much narrower than my last NB shoes, tennis and trainer. So much so that I'd be worried about stepping on a thumb-sized pebble and turning over my ankle. I need a lot of lateral stability. YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY.
Wore these for 3 months. The laces would get so tight from the toes to where you tie them i would constantly have to adjust them about 3 times a day.
I can't recommend these shoes  I can't recommend these shoes. As others have noted, they are narrower with a shallower toe box and not as well made as the 21's and prior models. They're OK as a walking shoe, but not as a running shoe. I can forgive a lot of things, but not when they've also reduced the cushioning in the shoe, supposedly for extra "lightness", as if the previous models were ever heavy to begin with. In my opinion, ASICS got some new bean counter in charge with a directive to save money, so they proceeded to cheapen the shoe and it shows. Read some of the other reviews of how quickly the shoes start breaking apart now, that never used to be the case. When I first went for a run with these shoes, I had to walk most of the way back, I was experiencing way too much shock in the balls of my feet and ankles. The lack of enough cushioning in the front of the shoe really shows now. I thought initially, well, the shoes are new, they'll get better. So I went for another run the next day, exactly the same results, pains in the balls of my feet. I abandoned them and went back to my old ASICS 21's, ahh, relief! I could jog normally again. I managed to find a seller that was selling a pair of 21's in my size, but after those wear out, I'm not sure what to do after that, I may have to swap brands if ASICS doesn't fix the problems with this new design. Pity really, they used to be (past tense) the best jogging shoe on the market.
:(  Awful they fall apart so fast.
Doesn't seem like they will last long  Small and tight, I would order a size larger.  Doesn't seem like they will last long.
Wrong Size Sent  Ordered a size 9 for my dad for Christmas and received a 7.5. I don't live in the US so I won't be able to return it. What a waste of money!
And to dirty to  Too small. And to dirty to return
super stiff!  this is my second pair.  1st pair was awesome and comfortable that lasted several years.  This pair on the other hand is just as stiff as my cycling shoes and uncomfortable after a mile. its been a 3 month of use and yet it still has not broken in. these would be great for spinning classes without the clipless as the soles barely bend.
Returned for Refund  Too narrow and tight, and the appearance was cheap. Returned for refund.
Fits too small.  I wear a 9.  I bought the 10 and it was too small and narrow.  The overall shoe quality and cushioning is was good but for me the shoe is 1.5 sizes too small and more narrow than I wanted.
UNCOMFORTABLE for my foot  UNCOMFORTABLE...RETURNED
Carefull with the size!!!  I brought the shoe half inch bigger than my shoes and it is still too tight the width. My feet get numb after 10 min wearing this shoe. Sad because the shoe look really well made and very durable.
No more Brooks,...too bad.  After having Brooks for 4 years, highly disappointed. Does not compare to previous versions and years. Used to be great for cushioning, now lacking. Hard on supination, so much so that I've gone back to New Balance after being irritated for 4 months.
I ended up returning these because they were so incredibly large. Disappointing
I am a size 11 and this pai was a kittle tight, need to exchange for a size 11.5
MX608v4 - Fit smaller than previous versions, made cheaper.  Very dissatisfied like many others who were once fans of these shoes. I have been a buyer of these for many years. The original MX608 (still have a pair, still fit me) were miles ahead in comfort and durability. The soles on the 608v3 just keep coming unglued and fall apart and the rubber under the heal is no where near as heavy and plush as original version. The 608v3 and 608v4 have had 1/4 inch material cut out under your ankle and the tongue (shoe lace area) is 1/4" wider. Saved them on material for each pair of shoes. Finally , the MX608v4 sizing is smaller, now I would need a 10-1/2  which then is to long. I haven't had the MX608v4 long enough for wear n tear yet but will be looking for another brand anyway. I hope this helps anyone else looking at these.
Loved the Clifton 1, but not the Clifton 2  The changes from v1 to v2 were for the worse for me. (for reference I'm 6' tall and weigh 178 lbs)  The redesign Hoka made to the upper, specifically the new padded and thicker tongue, from the Clifton 1 (which was very thin and flat) to the Clifton 2, resulted in what felt like reduced midfoot volume and made the shoe crease differently across the top of my foot in a way that was extremely uncomfortable to me. I realize there were some reviews from the Clifton 1 about a feeling of too much room and a feeling of sloppiness for some people that Hoka appears to have been working to sort out with the changes they made to the upper. Unfortunately, those changes ruined it for me. I was frankly surprised that the changes to the upper had such a dramatic effect on how the shoe felt through the strike and especially through toe-off. I can only describe it as a stiff and clunky feeling. I'm typically a midfoot striker myself but I would suspect that issue to be even more pronounced for runners that lean more toward a rearfoot strike. In any case, there was an immediately noticeable difference in the overall ride through each step. The Clifton 1 is one of my favorite shoes of all times specifically because of its nirvana-like smoothness through each stride. Whatever changes Hoka made to the upper in Clifton 2 (obviously more padded/built-up tongue but possibly other "fit" changes) made the overall shoe feel clunky and stiff and it lost all of the ride characteristics that I loved about the v1. I've not tried the v3 yet but have heard from folks that Hoka made another change to the upper. I'll hold out hope that those changes get the shoe back to the feel of the v1's.
... did such hard walking sport shoes The sole feels like a stone  Can't believe Reebok did such hard walking sport shoes The sole feels like a stone... Will shop for a soft ones...
Uncomfortable  Very uncomfortable and causes sore feet.  On only wear for few hours and take off.
Great shoe.  One small issue.  This is a wonderful shoe.  Fits well (I have very narrow feet), super comfortable and light.  I'm happy to pay the extra for a product that is made in the USA.  So why 2 stars?  I have worn this model for several years.  The first ones started to smell like cat urine (the outside of the soles near the heel) after a few months wear.  New Balance replaced the first pair TWICE at no charge, saying a problem with some adhesive caused the shoes to develop an odor similar to cat urine.  This year, they decided they would not replace them since they were way outside warranty.  That is perfectly understandable.  So I bought a new pair in January, 2015.  Seven months later, one shoe started to have that cat urine-like smell again.  It was only on the outside.  So I contacted New Balance again.  Here is their response:  "I am sorry you are experiencing an odor issue with your 990 shoes. I understand in the past we mentioned the odor issue is caused by an adhesive in the shoes. I would like to correct what we have told you in the past. After research and testing we have found the adhesive was not the issue in the odor issue. What we have found the odor is from moisture getting trapped in the shoe and the shoe not being able to completely dry out. The odor does take time to develop within the shoe if not completely dried out before the next wearing.  The 990 shoe does have a less breathable upper which makes it harder for the shoe to completely dry out before the next wearing vs. shoes that have a mesh upper are able to dry out at a faster rate than the 990 shoes. We have also found the best way to dry out the shoes is to remove the insoles, loosen the laces, and pull the tongue forward. This is the best way to dry out the shoes to help prevent the odor issue."  Thanks, New Balance, for the explanation.  But please ponder this.  One shoe of my current pair (7 months old) has that odd smell on the OUTSIDE of the sole, not the inside.  If it is a moisture issue, why doesn't the inside smell like the outside?  So far that question has not been explained to me by New Balance. And I don't believe I have exceptionally sweaty feet.  Plus, this has not been an issue in any other shoe I own.  Again, these shoes are not cheap.  And I will gladly pay for US-made shoes.  And the fit and comfort are exceptional.  But please consider the odor issue when purchasing.
Uncomfortable & Overpriced  Highly disappointed with this shoe.  I bought this shoe for my 16 year old. He prefers New Balance trail shoes and this is his 4th pair purchased.  He usually wears his shoes tied loosely.  Unfortunately, this shoe when tied loosely was very uncomfortable because your foot slides forward causing your big toe to rub excessively. We were the same size so eventually I commandeered the shoes.  Even with the shoes tied properly, my toes still nudge forward when walking.  The comfort of the shoes resembles a much cheaper pair of shoes, think $20 -$30 pair of shoes and what the might feel like.  Considering I payed $79 I feel very ripped off.  I definitely will have to reconsider purchasing New Balance in the future especially without trying them on first.
Didnt fit like the last pair from same company  Didnt fit like the last pair from same company. I went to a local store and found a similar style from same company, same size and it fit fine like old pair. Doesnt seem to be a consistency with sizes unless this is a knockoff.
Not for an American foot!
Bad  Bad product don't waste your time.  Had to return this product due to being to small and wouldn't fit properly.
fit like regular new balance used too  2e was too narrow...fit like regular new balance used too.
Hard as rocks  These things are hard as rocks! They have almost no shock absorption in the heel. I have leather work boots that are much better. This is why I don't get the Chinese made Walmart sneakers. $100 for this, are you kidding me? They seem well made and they came from the the seller quickly....but they suck.
Good looking show, but runs small  Shoe looks great and is what I wanted but in pure Nike style no two shoes of the same size fit the same. I had the previous version of these the dual fusion 2 in a size 12 and they fit great, I couldn't find these in local  stores so I ordered them based on my previous shoes well they are way to tight to be comfortable. Nike really needs to keep a consistent size pattern, a 12 should be a 12 from shoe to shoe. These are very hard to get on and there is no toe room making wearing them for any period of time a task.
Same company, same size, different fit. fit  Ordered the same size as the XT Wings 3, which are great. My toes pushed up against them for a full day before I gave them away. Don't buy these without trying them on.
PRETTY UGLY ONCE I TRIED THEM ON. RETURNED.
Brooks is Very Disappointing  Shoes are disappointing. I wear wide shoes and Saucony and Brooks are the 2 that offer these more than some other brands. However my last pair were defective and I was very disappointed that Brooks would not stand behind their shoes. The outer sole became unglued and they claimed it was from running in the heat. IT's SUMMER !! Saucony is also $20-30 cheaper and last longer.
Crippling arch support  What a huge disappointment.  I heard so many good things about Salomon shoes. I was glad to to finally get my first pair.  Look great, good construction, but completely unwearable.  The arch support in this shoe is so high, I doubt my toes even touch.  I gave it several days but, always came home with sore, throbbing feet. There is no way to reduce the arch and it is like walking with a golf ball in your shoe all day.  I don't even want to tell you what I had to do to make them wearable, but it involved new incerts and a dremmel tool.
They run small and the sole wear quickly. But the only true test is to hike in them. I did. They caused my toes to lose a nail. So I returned them. They would not take them because they had been worn. How do you test hiking boots without hiking in them. If you buy this, buy them from REI.
They don't last to long! Bought them 2 months ago and the bottom almost gone!
... me twice when I only ordered 1 pair they suck a don't waste you money it's not worth  The sizes are too small and they gave me to different sizes and charged me twice when I only ordered 1 pair they suck a don't waste you money it's not worth it
lited as 4E, no way  the size was supposed to be a 4E  wide , no way it  could be, I bought a similar pair Nike Pegasus 29 at an  outlet store that fit perfect, never will buy shoes online again, its a shame,, it is a nice shoe, the chinese just cant get sizes correct
Poorly Constructed.  I purchased 2 pairs of these shoes, one black and this blue one. A side by side comparison of both pairs of shoes showed a significant difference in construction. The blues ones had excess material between the last lace at the bottom leading to the toe area. I tried both pairs (men's 10) and the blacks felt and fit perfectly, while the blue ones felt as if I was standing on the side instead of squarely on the soles of the shoe. Not to mention, the blue ones looked hideous. I'm keeping the black pair, but returning  the blue ones. I don't plan on using them for running, but it's readily apparent that they are not very durable. I wanted a pair for the gym, and the other to pack in my overnight bag to minimize footprint of my carryon bag. Maybe I got a dud? Oh, they are not made for wide feet! I have narrow feet, and the black ones are a perfect fit.
toooooooo hardand hurt my foot  too hardit hurt my footso badi don't like  itnot worth  to buy,and it is expensive  to spend it to china
Great at first, 2 months in & blister damage is bad  I really enjoyed these shoes at first though they took a little breaking in with some heel blisters. I like that they offer a little more structure than previous models and that they are breathable. You can take them in the water if you really wanted to or on trails and any water would flow out pretty easily. I like the drawstring pull cord as a substitute to traditional laces as well.  However, after only two months of use, I have to get new shoes.  I waa hoping that these would provide me  great shoes all the way through my marathon training, race in November. I have already worn out the inside edges because of blistering and rubbing on the interior front edges of my feet.  It wasn't like that at first.  The hotspots have gotten worse & now causing major blisters.  I pull them tight, could get new insoles, but damage is done.
Disappointed by the quality  These shoes started to fall apart the first day my son wore them. Although they fit well they hurt his feet terribly.
Terrible Quality Control  I received my pair of size 13 shoes quickly after ordering. Upon trying my shoes on I noticed that the left shoe didn't fit at all like the right shoe.  Upon inspection of the shoes I noticed that both shoe claimed to be size 13 as posted on their tongue tags.  Next I put the shoes sole to sole and notice a dramatic size difference.  The left shoe was 1 to 1.5 inches smaller than the right shoe. I don't know how this would happen and must be a problem with quality control with Adidas.  I have bought other shoes from Adidas but have never had this problem.  Buy this style with caution.
Not as great as I expected...  Feet hurt within a half hour and my heel wouldn't stop slipping. I spent the rest of my time wearing the shoe thinking about how I couldn't wait to take them off.
hate these  All the salomon's ive tried fit odd. narrow toebox requires me to get a half size too big which creates problems for the rest of the shoes fit and the lacing system. the goretex makes them very stiff and when laced to snuff fit the tongue presses against the top of your foot is very iritating and extremely uncomfortable. I really hate how these fit!
The shoes are too small. I walked in them and my feet hurt for days.
Comfortable and supportive shoe with great tread  Comfortable and supportive shoe with great tread, however after approximately 30 miles of running the glue holding the sole on at the toe came unstuck on both the left and right shoe.
Product fits fine, but definetly not for people With flat feet  Product fits fine, but definetly not for people With flat feet, my foot pain increased with this show. I would recommend brooks beast, as they are the best
Adidaz! I am  size 13. WTF! I need you now!
Not for those with flat or collapsed arches  The thing you have to keep in mind is pronation.  If you over-pronate due to collapsed arches, this is not the Hoka model for you.  The Bondis are a neutral shoe.  If you need some arch support, try the Hoka Gaviota--built for those that need more ankle stability.
Thread falls apart at the seam.  In only 3 weeks they are beginning to come apart at the seams. With no scuffs or scraps the thread just falls apart at the seams. Happens right at the inside of your foot where your toes bend when you step.
coming apart  had these shoes about a month when the back gel cushions began coming off. had to re-glue them many times with shoe glue.
Quality  Very cheap feeling for new balance and the fit is horrible
The shoes failed and so did the company.  I have worn New Balance shoes for many years. And I can tolerate the fact that some models don't last very long. I guess it's the price you pay for comfort. But these shoes were useless in no-time. I can't tell you exactly how long it took them to disintegrate because I rotate them with two pair of 990V3s, a pair of M990s, dress shoes and work boots. I'm not a runner. At first, the M1540V2s fit well. They felt good. They looked good. Then after an incredibly short and easy life, the insoles disintegrated in multiple places. After sending photos (taken inside a New Balance Store) to the corporate office, they offered a $50 gift certificate as compensation. Out of principle, I refused their offer and will look for another brand that doesn't fall apart so easily.
They hurt my sons feet!
I am very disappointed. After just five months  I am very disappointed.  After just five months, two of the black sole treads fell off. I would not buy another ASICS product until the quality improves.
Great sneaker, happy customer!  I'm updating my earlier review which was written shortly after I purchased these.  I am no longer happy with them.  While I've enjoyed their fit (although they run small and I had to reorder a half size up from my usual) and found them light and stylish, they have begun to fall apart surprisingly fast, far more quickly than any other pair of sneakers I have ever owned.  This fact leads me to believe that some other reviewers might be right in guessing that they could be counterfeit.  I've owned Asics previously and always found them to be very durable.  The pair I own now I've owned for about 6 months.  I estimate that I've worn them about 3 times a week in that time, so I've worn them approximately 75 times.  One of the treads is already coming off of the shoe.  It has not worn through, rather the adhesive between the lower, black sole of the sneaker and the cushiony, white midlayer no longer holds the layers together.  I've owned all kinds of sneakers for years without ever experiencing this particular problem.  I don't think I've EVER had a pair of sneakers fail in this way.  Having owned and worn them as little as I have so far I have to say that I'm really disappointed, and overall surprised at the failure in durability.
Not even close to true 4E.  I found this product misleading in terms of width
4E at best was a 2E in width  The 4E width was so tight in the forefoot I could not wear them so I can not give a review in terms of use. I have had good luck with sizing on other New Balance shoes but not this time.
apesta!!!!!
Strange white speckles...  Black have white specks that look like paint. Looks bad! Returned
really flimsy  New Balance shoes used to last about 2 years 10 years ago, but now don't expect them to last more than 2 months.  These are really flimsy and are made of a "cheap mesh" that will probably tear in no time.  I wish New Balance would think about quality once again.
sent me a woman purple shoes totally waste of my time!! false advertisement  false advertisement  no stars!!!!!! waste of time
not nike's best  The shoes run small and narrow. Not much arch support. The toe box doesn't have much padding for soccer. For the money there are probably better deals on Amazon.
horrible shoes don't recommend these shoes to anyone not ar some purchase for the price. I would 0 start this review because they hurt my feet the day of wearing them.
Terrible.  The tongue feels like it's made of rigid cardboard that stabs into your foot.  Very cheaply made.
Just too small  Took the size off of a previous purchased pair however these were to small an don't fit the same to small
Looks nice, but not a good pair of running sneakers  Looks nice, but not a good pair of running sneakers.  The soles are too soft and I can feel every bump on the road.  In my opinion, these cannot  compare to other running sneakers like Asics or Saucony.
Terribly small and terribly narrow fit. Had to return them immediately. Sad :(
Poor  Upper material changes color .Poor quality. Yellow tape color gives
Very well made and supportive trail shoe, but the toe box is tight and pinches.  After hiking a couple days in Sedona, AZ I had several hot spots and blisters from these shoes.  I should definitely have ordered up a half size from 11 to 11.5.  Waited too long to return and swap out for the bigger size!
They're not 4e wide shoes like it says
My ankles don't like.  These shoes were very comfortable for the first week then it started to feel like I had broken both my ankles. I don't know if it's just me or the shoes but I've never felt that with any other foot ware before.
Wears very quickly.  Wears out far too quickly. Very comfortable, but not worth the money for only 6 months of unspoiled wear!
Cheaply made and a week late  Ordered the red black and grey. The red looked like a salmon color. Glue was on the sides of the shoe. Cheaply made shoes! Super disappointed and they were a week late.
there was a lot of wiggle room... wasn't the correct shoe for my daily job
Adidas not good at shoe sizing  Not what i expected
Persons who wear narrow size in shoes, should get this D size.  New balance sizes are narrower than standard.
Inner Fabric Tears  I can't recommend Asics anymore. The last three pairs I bought, including these, all had terrible problems with the fabric inside of the heel tearing pretty much immediately after I bought them. Three different shoes, with three completely different types of socks, all tore on the first day I used them. I ended up with blisters galore. If you're wondering why I continued to buy them, it's because I'd been using Asics for fifteen years prior and they were once an amazing brand. I don't know what happened, but I wanted to keep giving them the benefit of the doubt.
A Great Idea But...  I really liked the concept of this athletic shoe, but in spite of ordering it a half size larger than my normal shoe size, it was too small...  And the mesh liner that is attached inside made it very difficult to get it on or off...  Perhaps I'm just too old for it!
Too tight around the toes. Had to return
10.5 a llittle snug.  I did one 3.2 mile run and walked around for a day in them.  After the second wear the bottom of the shoe started to separate from the fabric.  Not sure if it was a lemon.  I ordered a new pair a half size bigger.  I'll post again if the shoe starts to fall apart again.  If not the shoes were good in the water.  Kept my feet dry.
same brand and model but conflicting  This is my second pair of the same model. I really like the first pair, which i bought for around the same price  from The Bay during sale. The bay never sell this model so I bought Tillamook from Amazon, expecting the quality to be the same. not only is the quality more inferior, the feel is not the same. The first pair is very comfortable and looks great. The second of different color and looks ugly and feel stiff and uncomfortable. This is unfortunate and I do not know the reason for the difference of quality and feel...
There are better Choices from Saucony  I love the brand and have had many different models over the years.  Saucony always seem to fit better and offer more cushioning for me and I feel like good shoes are why I've been able to run without any joint pain or injuries over the past 40 years.  That said, this pair has been a bit more difficult for me to get used to than others.  I've had a pair of Asics since my last pair of Saucony's and these just don't seem to fit quite like I'm used to.  Plenty of cushion but the hell doesn't feel secure and the toe box not as wide as in my old pair (same size) that I wear around the house .  It might be that I don't have the laces set right since it usually takes me awhile to get every thing just right or it may be something else.  I've only put a couple miles on them so far but that will be changing this week.  I'll update the number of stars if they do better after 10-15 miles. Update:  I actually had to do 50-60 miles before they got broken in.  It took that long before the heel didn't feel like blisters would soon start.  The toe box still seems too tight and I have to tie the laces a little too tight to keep the heel from slipping though I think that may go away after yet another 50 miles or so.  I'm only going to give these 1 star, not because they don't provide the protection that runners need, but because they don't fit my foot like previous models and other brands do.  The heel is simply too loose and that causes all sorts of other problems.  IMHO you can do better with other models of Saucony or other even other brands.  I may not give up on the brand but I won't be buying this model again.
Not typical Salomon  I've bought lots of Salomon shoes over the years and currently have 5 pairs.  These shoes are atypical of Salomon fit and quality.  My feet are 12 (left) and 12.5 (right) so I expected a 13 would be ok.  Length wise it is but the uppers are excessively tight.  I'm still trying to decide if I need to send them back.  If they stretch a bit then I would say no, but as is they are not comfortable.  They also seemed to have decreased their quality standards quite a bit.  I'm used to a great quality product from Salomon but these seem more like $30 to $40 knock-off shoes from a no-name factory yet they have a $100 Salomon price tag.
Wears out to quickly over the big toe  Been wearing these for a couple of months.  The shoes are in good shape, but the nail on my big toe on one foot has worn a hole in the inner fabric and is now about to bust through the outer (gray) mesh.  The quality of the fabric and mesh is low, it should not have worn out this quickly.  If they had extended the suede-like material to cover the big toe, like other models/brands it would have been fine.  Other ASICS shoes don't have this issue, neither do the Reeboks.
Worst quality shoe!!!!!!!  Worst shoe ever. I've worn mine 20 or so times and they have literally fallen apart today. Checked the other, it's falling apart too. Sole of shoe is just falling off randomly!!
Usual New Balance size for me 8 1/2. This shoe was too small at that size
the size if very small compared with the real size
Good Look but Poor Construction  I have had 2 previous pairs of Nike Men's Free 4.0 Flyknit shoes in years past. I loved the previous pairs. This year's model seems to have changed the design of insole. I am on my feet all day and noticed increased pain in my feet by the end of the day and mild plantar fasciitis. This is odd since I have never had any problems with my feet and have been working on my feet for years. My wife, a physical therapist, then noticed that the shoes were forcing me to pronate as I walked. That has never been my gait pattern until wearing these shoes. As soon as I switched back to my old shoes, (same model) I have not had that pronation problem.  On the bright side, the color and style are very nice.  Overall, good looking shoe that is poorly constructed.
took too long to get devivered, and took to long to get credit as too small
Ouch!!  Not sure why but these shoes are waaayyy toooo tight. Asics in other styles that size fit perfect. Buyer beware. Will be shipping them back FYI.
Way overpriced be careful.....  Way overpriced average price in the mall $70...
narrow foots only
sending them back  Bought for my son he has narrow feet but these shoes are still way to small and I even went up a size for him. I'm sending them back...
I have run in ASICS Nimbus for years. They have been super comfortable. I switched to Kayano this past winter to give them a shot. The toe is way too narrow! I got blisters on the inside of my toes within days of trying them. Back to my Nimbus 17s!
Size chart/logo  The logo in the shoe came off with one day of wearing them. Also very tight with sizing for the normal chart
Love the brand but, this shoe gave me a very bad experience..  May be the shoes are good, and I like the German brand Adidas a lot, unfortunately this shoe didn't with for me at all..! Once when wearing this shoe I twisted my ankle and the pain gradually elevated to knee.. and once I switched with a barefoot shoe, no problem at all.. it may be my problem or the shoe's but.. it's a bad experience
Feels like 5 star when new  Feels like 5 star when new. Good all around. My third pair and they all have fallen apart within months of rotating between several pairs. 2-6 month life expectancy. Addidas needs to step up the reliability game and badly.
Within a month all of the add on sole parts, yellow and black, have come off. The glue they use is worthless. They get NO stars from me.
Nice looking...  size NOT accurate
Who makes a trail shoe with no toe protector?  Does not make any sense to me.  Returned them immediately.
i Have return this item but i never get refund. i need to know whats going on.  Barco One Men's V-Neck Zip Pocket Solid Scrub Top... i put 2 other item under this pack.
Not Durable  Very light, very comfortable but did not last.  I only wore them to walk the dog and they hardly lasted two months. A pity, I've always liked my NBs in the past.
They Squeak and They're Cheap Chinese Junk  I don't know why, but these sneakers squeak when you walk.  It's kind of annoying.  Other than that, I have no complaints.  Update, January 8, 2015: I reviewed these shoes on March 10, 2014, after I had had them for perhaps a month.  So let's say I bought them in early February, 2014.  It is now January 8, 2015.  The shoes have been washed maybe 4 times and they are falling apart.  The soles have come loose and there are holes in the fabric. $89 for these shoes is far too much to pay.  I'd never buy these shoes again and my experience with them has left a sour taste in my mouth for New Balance. There must be more durable and better-made sneakers on the market.
I have been wearing Saucony's for over 15 years; only running shoe I use.  I have been running the Triumphs for at least 7 years,  Hurricanes before that.  This is first pair of Saucony's  I have ever owned that I do NOT recommend.  I am on line looking for Triumph ISO 2's....love them.  Steer clear from the ISO 3.  My knees hurt and foot fell asleep.  Tried them for several days to be sure not use a "one off" issue.
The don't last  March 2013: I recently started on Couch to 5K program. This is my third week. I also wanted to get into barefoot running. I have a wide foot and it's hard for me to find shoes that fit. These were available in 12.5 Wide, so I purchased them. First thing that I noticed is the tongue. The material is very thin (this is a very light shoe), and it's hard not to have the tongues fold length-wise on each side. The shoes fit, but still they felt too small because I had to loosen the shoe laces a lot to fit my feet in. I ran a few times in them and they weren't comfortable for me. They have Vibram soles, so I expected the "barefoot" feeling everyone is raving about. Nothing like that. Until today.  Today, on a whim, I pulled the inserts out. They were Dr. Scholl's inserts! The very thing we're supposed to avoid in the first place while trying to run barefoot! So I took them out, put the shoes on and that made all the difference! I was very comfortable. Could feel different ground textures with my feet, ran barefoot-style for half-hour and enjoyed myself very much!  So take those inserts out!  -- Update 07/22/2013: So I've had these shoes for about 4 months now. Both now have a tear in material about an inch long, along the crease above little toe. I don't wear these every day. I only put them on when I run. Optimistically, I ran about 35 runs in them, each 3 miles long, so about 100 miles total. I don't expect them to last until fall. Also, while re-reading my original review above, I have a feeling I was sold the shoes that someone returned before, hence the mention of Dr. Scholl's inserts. So pay attention when you unpack them if you decide to purchase these shoes.
Unfortunately show tan has oil dart.
Worst NB I owned.  Even though they are wide they are to tight on top of toes. I'm on my feet at work for 10+ hrs a day and these kill my feet. Always liked NB but these left my highly dissatisfied.
Never delivered  Horrible!!
Pop Goes the Running Shoe  Great shoes until the left air bladder ruptured. I run only on paved surfaces, about 15 miles per week. Akaisports would not accept or never bothered to read the reason for the return. The failure happened just outside the 3 month return window. $100 wasted. Trying Nike to see if they'll help me out.
I was happy with this product at first but then after four months they started to wear holes in the sides of the shoe from normal wear. I was very happy and got a full refund. Will never buy these shoes again.
I definitely expect more from a company like New Balance  Fabric eyelets ripped off on the third day of wear. I definitely expect more from a company like New Balance. This was my second pair of this style shoe. The first pair fell apart after 2 months. Such as shame as these shoes are some of the most comfortable that I have ever worn.
Incosistant sizing or mislabeled? I own numerous pairs of adidas in size 10 and never had a fit so much larger than advertised.
defect on right foot  2 point defect. scrach on front, dirty around holes. however, i cannot return bcoz overseas.
Insole comes loose during Obstacle/Spartan Races  Sorry for the low rating, but with almost 2000 reviews, it was unlikely that folks would read anything but the 1 star and the 5 star reviews.  I actually like the shoe a lot (a bought 2 pairs, one for myself, and one for my son).  The key problem is that the insert comes loose and jams in the toe area during an obstacle race (i.e. Spartan).  This happened to both my son and I, and occurred after the water obstacles.  This "defect" was pointed out in numerous 4 star reviews.  Which is what I would have rated this shoe:  4 Stars!  But if you are like me, you don't tend to read the 4 Star reviews.  Hence I'm hoping that I'm providing a public service to folks that will buy this shoe in the future, and that can possible fix the shoe prior to their big race.  Several of my 4 Star colleagues recommended using Shoe Goo or some other type of glue.  I will try to experiment, and will update my review in the future.  But whatever the glue ... make sure its water proof.  Final comment:  the insoles only came out, came loose when wet.  I had run in the shoes for several days on the street with no problem.  Recap of the Pro's and Con's  Con's - The insert comes loose (both shoes), and jams in the toe area - and unfortunately, without the insert, the shoe was a bit too loose for me - perhaps a bit too long for me.  Felt my foot moving forward when heading down a steep slope  Pro's - Fantastic tread.  As long as it wasn't slick rocks, the shoes had great traction.  Fantastic for a Spartan/Tough Mudder race. - Decent in Water.  Was recently caught outdoors in my ASIC street running shoes during a thunder storm.  Those shoes weighed a ton.  However, when the Solomon SpeedCross 3's got wet (swimming in  a lake during a Spartan race), they squished, but there was no significant storage of water, and no significant incremental weight - I have fat feet.  I typically take a 9.5 EEEE shoe, and as such, tend toward ASICs or New Balance to get the wider shoes.  I was worried that these Solomons would overly squeeze my feet (@ 10 D).  Although a bit tight at first, I found them to be quite comfortable, with no blisters during the break in period.  Bottom line.  In spite of my 1 star review (so that you would read my comments regarding the insoles), I would highly recommend these shoes.
Design of this shoe gave me blisters.  If you are the type of person that gets blisters on your heals these shoes are not for you . The back of the shoe has an undercut cup that your heal goes into , as soon as i put them on i said that's not good . Sure enough one run, i got  blisters going to play with tightness some maybe it can be corrected.
I know that they are a good pair of shoes thou  Too small...I wear a size 10 but this 10.5 is still small..I know that they are a good pair of shoes thou.
Cannot recommend  I was a happy owner of one of previous models made by Skechers. But currently I'm really disappointed in Skechers.  The biggest disappointment is loose insoles which are freely moved here and there. Perhaps, I can glue them but I don't expect that new shoes have to be fixed just on thex next day after my purchase.  The second disappointment is that they are too warm even in cold weather (cheap fabric?).  And the last disappointment is that they started smelling after a few days. This has never happened with my shoes before.
Nice looking shoe but way too small  This is my first pair of Puma's and I can wear a 10.5 or 11. I bought a 10.5 and it was way to small.  With socks on and the shoes tied my feet hurt and look like the circulation was cut from my feet.  I hate returning things but theses will have to got back.
Very disappointed in their performance  Our son loves the shoe, HOWEVER, after one day of use the tread of the shoe started to separate. Very disappointed in their performance.
Narrow even tho I ordered 12w
I have another pair of Vibram Five Fingers shoes in a 44; both the 44 and 45 are just too tight on my foot.  I highly recommend going a few sizes up or just buying these in-store where you can try them on.
Supports break easily  good running shoe, very comfortable to wear. I rate them with two stars as one of the heel supports on my right foot broke after 4 months use.
Worn out way too soon.  These are worn out within 10 months of purchase, including the winter when they were barely used. By the fall, I had to sew one of the laces loops back together. And by spring, the loops are detached and the tread is seriously worn. And I don't use them as my primary footwear for hiking. I had a previous pair last a few years. Since this pair didn't make it a single year, I assume the manufacturing quality has significantly diminished. I can't see buying Salomons again.
Great looking shoe, but horrible quality fit and comfort..not shocking since Reebok is tanking!  I pretty much workout on a daily basis and am a competing bodybuilder, so I really take running/tennis shoes to the test. The Zigmaze II from the outside is great and looks quality, just like the picture.. however, they run too large, which is not really the biggest issue. The heal of the shoe runs low/short, so it feels like the shoe is going to just come off at anytime you walk ..almost like I have to dig my foot in the shoe to keep it on. I typically wear a size 12, sometime 11.5, but these are a little loose even at size 11 for me. I think the look of the shoe is what everyone is excited about and rates the shoe so well, which is even reason I am keeping them but thats just cause I am a tennis shoe nut. I recently bought Asics, Mizunos and New Balance shoes (more than one pair each!) and they exceed Reebok by a mile! I was a Reebok fan and still like some of their styles but it's all look and no quality fit or comfort..No wonder so many sports stores dropped them.
Do not buy!  This is the second pair of MO80 shoes I have purchased from Amazon and both pairs have ripped on the side after being worn a few times.  I have 15 pairs of other styles of New Balance shoes and have never had a problem with them.
Too narrow, even with extra wide  Knowing how new balance is, I ordered extra wide. Still didn't matter, they were horribly narrow and caused my feet severe pain. They just don't fit when comparing to other shoe manufacturers
Something is off with the pair I just got.  It seems like its a counterfeit or something...
The company sent me a different pair and they are wonderful. Very Comfortable  I only used these for exercising and in a short time they were ripping on the top where the toes are.  The company sent me a different pair and they are wonderful.  Very Comfortable.
brooks shoes  I ordered a pair of size 13 shoes. It seems Brooks uses a different tape measure than the other shoe companies because theses were much larger than my other size 13 shoes (New Balance & ASICS). Won't be buying Brooks again.
Not impressed ... wish  I could return them.  I am 40 years old and a heavier runner. (5'11'', 205lbs) I usually wear Mizuno Wave Riders.  I wanted to try these because of the hype around the comfort and super padding.  I found a few things wrong and not much right:  1.  They make my feet very hot!  When running in 80 degrees, my feet felt like they were 350 degrees!  These shoes do not breathe well enough for me. 2.  I was working  harder than usual during my runs.  Because of all the extra cushion, when my foot lands, I sink in the cushion and I lose any "spring back" feeling that would assist me in my running stride.  Its like running on a mattress.  That's the best way I can describe it.  The only thing I can say that is somewhat positive, is I did a sprint triathlon recently in these shoes.  While other runners my size were walking during the run, I did not feel the need to do so.  This could have been related to training but may have been associated with the reduced impact from the extra cushion.  I consider myself well trained for that distance triathlon.
to narrow  these shoes were nice but they were to narrow and I always where 2e I wish you would replace them with the right ones that fit.
dreadful
Not comfortable at all!  Horrible running shoes, blistered my feet.
Bad shows and sizes small
They look better in real life but are sized incorrectly. - Id recommend buying 3 sizes up  I received my shoes today but found they were way too small (the measurements on the description were incorrect)  I read a number of posts prior to purchasing them that said the shoes are a small make, so to be sure I had my wife measure my feet and check the sizing chart to make sure. All my other sports shoes are a size 11 so as per, customer feedback I ordered the size 12.  I could barely get my foot through the hole - its that bad.  I 'could' return them but that was going to cost me around $90.00 to send them from Australia back to the UK so i ended up giving them away to a guy who wears size 8 (they just fitted him)
they were more like a hot pink then a red  They were for my husband.  Unfortunately, they were more like a hot pink then a red.  They went back.
The one I received is alike but completely different from the one in the picture. I thought I ordered running shoes but it must be kidding the shoes says fashion.
shoes don't fit like other nikes.  way to large.
44 is NOT 10-1/2 us!!  They mis calculated the size in the description.  Way way too big. Kinda a pain to return and correct sized shoes were $15 more,,
Merrell Barefoot not Comfortable  Dear Merrell, I didn't like this Shoes for these reasones. First I started to have Heels pain, 2nd shin slpit, third Knee pain. I tried to run on trad mill, and I run on the track, but  still have the same issue with it, I think I need a shoes with some Cushion shoes that will helps with the running.
10 1/2 feels like size 11 
What good is comfort if it only lasts a month?  Shoe fit fine, were super comfortable, but what good does that do me when they only last a month? The sole of the shoe came detached, I can't even image what would have happened if i ran with them outside... I still have the original MX20 and use it as my lifting shoe both in training and competition, and they are still in amazing condition, this shoe however did not meet the standard set by them...
Felt like I was wearing elf shoes.  Even though it said a size ten, the shape of the shoe made the shoe very uncomfortable and floppy after a few days and started to rub the back of my foot pretty bad...good thing I didn't pay a mint for these.
not good  bottom of heal trends ripped away less than a month of use 5 trail runs.. not good
Should not be used for shot or disc
Had them one month and the stiching on the toe has already come undone, leaving a hole at the toe
I didn't like it at all.
Don't believe everything you read  The reason for the two stars is that it states gore-tex waterproof construction, when they arrived the next day it rained and I wore them and my feet were soaked, really disappointed and I will think about purchasing sneakers again on amazon.
De sole of this shoes is a bad quality Make a really black  mark on the floor and is no really easy to toke of
Good: Worked great as a trail shoe and snow shoe for running.  Used it in the snow several times and kept my feet dry for several 10 milers.  On the trail the shoes gripped as expected on semi technical terrain, even on large rocky outcroppings. Bad: Started to fall apart after a couple runs while sitting waiitng for the next trail run.  I've never had a shoe do this before.  They were cleaned and stored properly, but holes just started to appear at the seams.  These are Gortex, more expensive than the standard 910's, I expected better for an expensive (In my opinion) shoe.
Good  Good shoes legit compared to my other ultra essential. comfy shoes light weight seem new. Good price compared to does store's. True to size fits. Only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because  shoe box it came with was destroyed. They did not ship it with care. As a huge air max collector I enjoy the box as much as the shoe. Have all my shoe on display with box under  but this one is impossible to display box literally falling apart. It's a miracle shoes aren't damaged. Should be shipped like every other shoe the box in abox.
not great fit  One shoe is rubbing oddly against my ankle.  I run tough mudders and was hoping for a good fit for a long distance run.  I couldn't walk around my living room without the left one really bothering me.  right one fits like a dream.  annoyed and sending back.
Great comfort, but lace system went bad and not getting any real support from their customer service  I think these are really comfortable shoes... Unfortunately the lace system won't hold on the right shoe now after only sparingly being used for 3.5 months and after many exchanges of correspondence with Hoka support, I am only left with an option of sending them in for their evaluation.... And that is hard to trust to be completely honest. Sad after only 3.5 months of Sparingly wearing them, and spending $131.60 on them.
Not the same quality they used to be  I am a long time user of the New Balance M587. Unfortunately I was disappointed with the quality control of my recent purchase. After a couple days of wearing the shoes they started squeaking. I thought this would go away with more break in but it did not. Amazon was great in sending me two replacements. Although the replacements were the same size as the original order they were a very snug fit. Maybe half a size smaller than the original. I will have to reconsider these shoes after the quality issues.
Love the shoe design but it is waaaaay to narrow.
Incorrect sizing  Be aware that the sizing on these is men's/"unisex" and NOT women's.  When I ordered, I specifically searched for "women's 7.5".  I received a men's 7.5/women's 9
Not going to waste my money again on New Balance  Shoe began to fall apart from soles up. Rubber came undone from shoe within 3 weeks of wearing at work in production shop. Not going to waste my money again on New Balance.
Adidas  Good shoe however not for me.
Too tight and narrow even a half size bigger thyan my foot.  Too tight on my feet, had to return them.
Size is inaccurate- have been wearing Nikes for 20+ years and have never not worn a size 8 yet these are too small.  No arch support, very disappointed and now have to pay to send them back due to seller's return policy.  Buyer beware!
I bought a size 8.5, but I received Size 9.5
Back to the drawing board.  After downloading multiple apps and trying for days I could never get the shoe to track my steps.  I own a software development company and a retail computer store so I think I am pretty tech savvy but I am also turning  48 this year so maybe its some law of nature when you get this age you just stop understanding how to configured these new newfangled devices.  (In which case I owe my dad a sincere apology for all the grief I gave him over his inability to understand the internet or smart phones) But what I can say with 100% confidence is do not buy these shoes if you do any activity which requires quick stop and go motions and pivots. I played racquetball a couple times in this shoe and  it did not go well.  The sides of the shoes are made of very light weight material and have no reinforcement so if you do a fast pivot there is a 50/50 chance the shoes will buckle and cause your foot and ankle to do a cirque du soleil like contortion.  Again in UA defense I am not an avid runner so maybe this is what I get for using a true runners shoe instead of a instead of a Ektelon,to play Racquetball. but I have been playing for years wearing a variety of shoes including Nike, Reebook, and ASICS  and never experienced that same issue.
Blisters  The arch supports are about an inch too far forward and instead of supporting my arch, they just give me insane blood blisters on the inside of the balls of my feet after just five miles of asphalt pounding.  I've put somewhere between 50-100 miles on them already, so they should be reasonably broken in, but they're still killing my feet like none other.  I regret buying these shoes....  I guess running shoes are something you really should goto a store for.
Painful experience  I bought a new pair of Asics Gel Nimbus 14 after reading raving reviews. I tried it in the store first but I didn't run much there. On average, I do 20 Miles running per week on roads. After just one run in the new shoes, both my legs started hurting all over the places. Below knees, shins, calves etc. The shoes made a huge noise while striking feet on ground. The sound felt as if my strides are abruptly made short. I removed cushion and gave it a try and now I am doing OK.
Falling apart all other Gens are a better quality  I recently purchased a pair of the Kinsei-5 I've owned every Gen except for the first and they all lasted extremly long and thats with me being in the militay and deployments. But these 5's started to rip all along the toe area and I've only done tedmil and a little runing outside. So I tried to contact customer service so far it's been a week and no response from the customer service.
Too Small, Quality issues.  Finally, had a chance to use the sneaker.  It is light, but the fit is too snug, and after 1 full day, the seams on the right sneaker broke.
I have had these shoes less than a month and the Velcro straps are already worn and don't stick so the shoes fall off.
:(
A Brooks dud  They are just not as comfortable as other Brooks shoes I have worn.
Okay for Walking but not for running  Despite a number of negative reviews by people who developed blistering on their feet, I purchased this model because of the price which was more than $100 less than I would have paid locally.  When I put them on, there seemed to be a drop in the forefoot area.  There also seemed to be gaps between the shoe and the foot.  They were also a half-size larger than my Omni and Mirage running shoes though they are listed at the same size.  I walked in them for a week before taking them on the treadmill for a run.  After 2 miles I developed a blister on the instep of my right foot close to the ball of the foot.  The left shoe was flush with my foot and didn't cause any problems.  I wouldn't recommend these for running.
Worst shoe and feet move when sweaty  Worst shoes ever bought when sweaty feet moves and rolls easily in this shoe and bad lace and eyelet design
Made these my yard work shoes earlier than expected.  I was a big fan of the prior versions of this shoe (GT-2150, GT-2160, and GT 2170). Unfortunately, ASICS switched the support levels in this "updated" model and I could really feel it. Specifically, whereas the GT-2150, GT-2160, and GT 2170 had plenty of arch support, the GT-2000 is less supportive. You may end up liking it, but don't plan on it being consistent with those models. I had to switch to the (more expensive) ASICS Kayano to get the support I needed.  After giving these shoes about 100 miles of running, I actually had to turn them into the shoes I use for working outside and mowing. Ugh.
very poor quality.  It's 3 months later and the shoes are completely worn out, they developed a whole in the left shoe at the toe and the sole is coming off the right one.
Not comfortable for even walking, let alone running.  These shoes suck.  Not comfortable out of the box.  Gave the shoe 1 star bc of the hassle-free return.
Misled by the brand, I thought this was adidas. The shoes is ok. It feels hard in the middle.
Stay away, save money for something better.  No support, not cushioned and not comfortable.  Need I say more?
Beware of Velcro  My husband has the hardest time finding a comfortable exercising sneaker..well, here it is.  this is third pair of the same color, same model so it must be the right one!!  Hard to find a WW.  Believe they suggest a half size larger and that works perfect. UPDATE:  Thought I was buying same running shoe 8/16 but came with velcro on heel.  After reading other reviews that had same problem with the velcro...thanks to gentleman's review....found you need to order 521MX115.  Wish Amazon carried that style.  Returned shoes and called Apex to order correct one. Yesterday hubby received right shoes exactly as the other 3 pair he has worn out over last decade. Only difference is "Apex" on back of heel.  The Rhino X which I originally ordered thru Amazon is now Boss Runners 522M and has the velcro.  Apex sent catalog along with shoes with the correct picture showing the velcro.
Unexpected what i think coz i just try to fit on my feet start hurting Uncomportable
Great shoe unless the air sole pops  They were great until the sole blew out while carrying some things to my car.
The Gel Kayano 22's are much tighter than previous versions  I have worn the Asics Gel Kayano for several years and have never had a problem with fit and have always gotten a very competitive price through Amazon. The Gel Kayano 22's were to replace the Gel Kayano 20's which were absolutely perfect. I was surprised in how poor the Kayano 22's fit. They were tight at the toe and walking in them for 30 minutes let alone running was agonizing. something definitely wasn't right. Fortunately, Amazon has made the whole return process very easy.
Beware the heel adjustment!  It's a good shoe for outdoors, lightweight, moderate arch support. What's annoying for me is the heel adjustment, it constantly slips after tightening. You'll find yourself constantly pulling (about 5-10 minutes of walking and they're loose) on the tab. Either the tab is too wide to hold fabric, or the fabric is too thin. There's just not enough friction and you'll be reaching down and tightening quite often. I don't wear them as often as I'd like to because of this.
Would not recommend running in them  Ok for walking.  Would not recommend running in them.  Quite uncomfortably and seem over toe can be felt during each stride.
Worst watch ever  They say it is waterproof ..but the really it is not..just look at the photo
Fit different than in the store  Tried on these shoes at a Dick's Sporting Goods store, then ordered them.  The ones I got fit nothing like the ones I tried on.
SCAM SCAM SCAM  If there was a no star option I would give it... this is a SCAM SCAM SCAM so beware
I found them to fit great, feel great and provide good arch support  If you run more than casually, stay away from these shoes.  I have been wearing NB for the past 10 years and bought these shoes due to sale price. I found them to fit great, feel great and provide good arch support, even helping me overcome a foot injury.  The problem is that the "nubs" that form the tread wear out QUICK. I bought them 23 DEC and send them back mid FEB, after running 40-50 miles a week. In the last week I had to stop wearing them due to mid foot friction, basically, it was too painful to keep wearing them. Fortunately (and surprisingly) Amazon took them back, their customer service has been the best thing about these shoes.  See the pics, "running shoes" should not wear out like this after, at most, 200 miles. 2nd pic just to demonstrate I have a little experience with NB shoes.... Sorry New Balance, these shoes are a miss!
Poor Fit  I always wear 11.5M and this pair is too short and too narrow. I'm going to attempt to return them for a 12M. I write this with an older pair of NB that are 11.5M and fit fine (different model).  Update: So I ordered a half size larger and the length is fine (barely). However, the width is a little tight while the heel is a little too loose for my liking. I had tried them on and they seemed to fit (initially) and it was trash day--so i threw out all of the packing material. Otherwise, I would return them. They are the most uncomfortable shoes I own. They'll last a long time because I'll seldom wear them. My last pair of New Balance!
Really liked them until the one broke after two weeks of light wear.  No running
Just not for me . . .  I have owned Saucony shoes in the past and some of them have been nothing short of great.  My wife runs in the women's version of this model and loves them.  Maybe I have been ruined by my Hoka One One Clifton 2s.  These Saucony Triumphs was just not as comfortable as I wanted them to be.  A bit tight in the toe box and upper all around I thought.  (I ordered my usual size but still found them tight.)  I think the drop was a bit much for me too.  I ended up returning them.
Not a nimbus  Nice shoe but they didn't hold up to the nimbus I am use to.
these TR 2s became painful to wear  These did not work for me.  I am a solid size 9 and never needed a wide shoe/sneaker.  After wearing for a few hours, these TR 2s became painful to wear.  Seemed very narrow and also very tight on the top of my foot.  Styling was good.
SHOES ARE SMALLER THEN NORMAL SIZES  I BOUGHT THE SAME SIZE AS MY PREVIOUS ASICS,  BUT THESE  SHOES WERE TOO SMALL,  HAD TO RETURN THEM.
Shoes fit real small!
Does not accomodate wide feet anymore?  I have wide feet and the 4e did not accomodate as well as pairs from previous years.
Junk!  Falling apart after only wearing 6 times. Save your money and don't buy this junk.
I don't like them. They are way small. I wear an 8 and even the 9's are tight.
Landon  Hi, I gave this 1 star just so you would read my review. I bought the shoes and they are great. (I would actually give them 5 stars) I'm a 9.5 or 10 shoes size. I ordered a size 10 and they fit perfectly. So if you are stuck between two sizes get the bigger size. I agree with a lot of the reviews online when I say, "the shoes run a bit narrow." In the middle of the foot they get a little tight. But I actually like it. The shoes also have a white plastic look to them.  If you were looking for a plain pair of shoes these might stand out a little more. They look really fancy and shiny. Finally, I can't say much about durability because I just bought them. However, there are multiple layers of material, which is more than I can say about my last pair of Asics. So Asics is getting better at durability.  The material around the shoes is definitely thicker for a tight feeling. I can feel it around the toes, unlike my last pair of Asics.
Adidas Quality gone  Adidas were has the quality gone?  Glue was exposed between the shoes and the sole.  The sole was already pealing away.  These were not even close to being the quality they use to be.  Stiff, rough edges, I tried to wear they around the house to break them in but just couldn't bare just walking in them.
Holes!  Light and comfortable but lack durability. Within three months these shoes developed holes in sides near the toes. Mostly used for walking on hard flat surfaces so there is no reason the sides should be blown out. I bought these to replace a pair of Redmonds that lasted over a year of hard use. They most have changed something because these new ones wore out quick.
Very tight for a 4E shoe.  I had to return.
Does not hold up  Comfy?  Yes.  Durable?  No.  I've had them a month and they look like I've had them a year.  This is with no actual trail running or running of any kind.  I got them on clearance at a brick and mortar, I see now why they were on clearance.  If you want something that will hold up on the trails, look elsewhere.
Was a great shoe, Now falling apart, Poor return policy  The shoes were great up until the sole started to come apart.  A section of the sole is pealing off.  The shoes have only been worn indoors for HIIT classes, running on treadmills and indoor track.  They are no longer eligible to be returned because the return window has expired.  I know now NOT to purchase a pair of last generation shoes online.  Local stores would gladly accept a return in a situation like this in order to keep my business.  I just hope other shoes I purchased from Amazon last longer that a few months.  Very disappointed in this shoe, they were on sale and now I know why.  My prior pair of ASICS Gel Cumulus 16 lasted for 2 years and are still in good shape.  I am now back to wearing my old shoes.
after my first run I start to have an ankle pain and feel not comfortable at all  Having using Wave Inspire 10 before, I decide to buy this new Mizuno Wave Inspire again. However, after my first run I start to have an ankle pain and feel not comfortable at all.
support problems  the shoes seem to have very little arch  support but the shoes are light and good for running ,if more support
buy a half size bigger than you normally wear.  Whenever I buy a new balance at the store the size they state is correct, and whenever I buy at Amazon the size is always a half size smaller.
Tread peels off.  Avoid this unresponsive seller of poor quality shoes.  These shoes only lasted about 10 short runs before the tread started peeling off.  They still look new and are already junk.  UPDATE-  I have tried to contact the seller with no response.  I am guessing that these were fake Reeboks.
A total fiasco  I bought these shoes on August 2016 with a big expectation. I have never washed them so far and  I have mostly worn them in the gym. Nevertheless it has been ripped. I am disappointed.
made in china  i don't know if nike already have a factory in china, but all my nike shoes are made in vietnam, so Im a little bet dissapointed!!!
Read the Shoe Description Carefully  Shoe does not fit the same as the product it replaced.  It is very plastic and rigid. In addition, there are issues with the description posted of the product - read it very carefully as you know who is blocking me from saying you don't know what about the shoe and the related how you get it procedures.  Pay attention to who fulfills the order.  It's bad enough that the shoe itself has issues; it's worse that Big Brother isn't allowing a truly honest discussion of this product.
Mizuno does NOT stand behind it's defective shoes  The expensive Mizuno Wave Creation has been my go to shoe for the past 6 years.  I have run 9 marathons and several thousand miles in them in that time period.  I have gone thru at least 15 pairs in that time period, as I put down a lot of miles.  Last year, I began to have problems with the shoes, noticing that on several pairs the posts under the heel had broken.  I contacted Mizuno, and they promptly sent me replacements on 3 pairs.  I thought this was fantastic customer service at the time.  Subsequently, one of the pairs oddly developed a tear in the liner of the heel of the right shoe.  This happened pretty early in the life of the shoe, probably only about 100-150 miles on it.  I sent them back and they replaced them.  Incredibly, the replacement pair has now developed a tear in the liner of the heel again, in the exact same spot.  I put this shoe on for the first time 12 weeks ago on 3/15/12 (I wrote it on the insole).  I rotate three pairs of road running shoes at a time so they are broken in for racing, etc.  I am currently running about 30-35 miles per week, so at most, these shoes could have 150 miles on them.  Last week during a run I felt a nagging rub on my right heel again, and discovered that once again, the inside liner of the shoe has torn in the exact same spot, tearing up my sock and producing a significant blister on my foot.  I sent a note to Mizuno alerting them to this problem again, and this time they have decided they will no longer stand behind their product, telling me that although I have had the shoes for just 8 months (their warranty is supposed to be for 1 year) that since they already replaced them once for this problem, they will not replace it again.  It seems to me that since the shoe is tearing in the same place, at about the same mileage, that it is likely a defect in the shoe, and not my foot.  I have sent multiple letters disputing their response, and even called their customer service, but they will not budge and will not replace my shoes.  Keep in mind, these shoes should be good for 300-500 miles.  It saddens me greatly to find this out, knowing that I have bought many shoes from them, that at $150.00 they are one of the most expensive shoes on the market, and that they probably cost Mizuno under $10.00 to manufacture.  On a positive note, all the reviews say it is a very heavy shoe, so perhaps this will prompt me to find a new company and new shoe that improves my running times......  I will never buy shoes from Mizuno again.  While they used to have an excellent warranty policy, they have obviously changed this and do not value their loyal customers.  I would recommend you do not purchase from them either.
Very tight
Too small  I think there was a miscommunication about the sizing and I was disappointed with the time it took to resend the shoe back.
Not happy!!  These are a month old and the soles are separating already from the shoe. Not happy!!
Comfy but sizing is WRONG!  Shipping was fast and everything arrived in good condition. These shoes felt and look great on my boy. But, like most everyone who bought this brand, the sizes ran SMALL. Ordered a half size bigger thinking they'd fit but they DON'T. Its a TIGHT fit for him. So, for you guys out there who are thinking of getting Adidas shoes, go up 1-1.5 size bigger, depending on how wide your feet is. Adidas don't make wide sizes, just narrow or regular sized shoes, which is totally ridiculous considering these are sports shoes. I was expecting these shoes to be made in China, but they're made in Indonesia. Either way, Adidas needs to address this sizing issue fast with their Asian producers because most of us 'regular' people do NOT have dainty, Asian feet!
too Narrow  this is not 4e shoe , it is  2e shoe they look bulky , they look like 6e shoe . they have too much padding that make them look bulky and ugly . they are little heavy . they are great for their softness , buy New balance , it is truly 4e .
Wrong size 8.5 being labeled as size 8,5  This is my 3rd pair of Altra size 8.5 (US), this pair came much smaller than my regular Altra Size 8.5 (See the black pair is so much smaller)
Disintegrate after a season.
Everything was too small  Shoes run small and laces are not long enough to even tie at the last two holes, Very disappointed. My feet, shins, and heal all hurt after just a few miles in these. Will most likely be donating them to the homeless.
Amazingly Comfortable  These shoes are super comfortable - they look and feel great! UNFORTUNATELY, the sides (on both shoes) started to rip out within a few months.
Too narrow.  I've ordered size 11 in the past and this is the first shoe received that didn't fit.  Returning.
Arrived dirty!!!  They arrived with dirt stains.  Hopefully I didn't pay extra for that! The laces and soles were dirty and the box was severely damaged.. will be sending back!
Not as good as the first version  Not as good as the first version. Quality has gone down hill. Probably the last New Balance I will buy. I have purchased NewBalance for 20 Years. Never again.
Size was too large. This shoe to me was very uncomfortable. Delivery was fast! Returned this shoe with no problem.
Good shoes, but they started falling apart in only six months of walking.
I do not like these hiking shoes at all  I do not like these hiking shoes at all. The toe box is extremely small while the rest of the shoe is large. Heel lifts easily while toes are crammed up.
Shinsplints  These shoes do not support the foot well. I have never had shinsplints, but after a month of using these shoes, I developed them. I normally have great things to say about Reebok, but this time I have been let down. These shoes would be fine for walking or goofing around at home, but running (which they are designed and sold for/as) I would avoid wearing them.
Super light weight, good cushion, FITS SMALL!  Great lightweight shoe but they run SO SMALL!  My 44.5 is tiny and I so wish I had returned for a 45 or bigger before wearing them outside. No such luck. Anyone want to trade for a practically unused 44.5?
Tears around small toe in no time  Great looking and fitting shoes. Very lightweight, great for everything - trekking, running, everyday walking.  BUT  Both of the shoes developed a tear around the area of little toe in almost the same time, with probably 1 day difference.  Hate to give it 1 star but I must say it's quite disappointing having to throw them away only 1 month of use.
never again  I like the color of these so I took a chance. I have worn Avia for years so I have previously liked the quality, however these shoes fell apart after only 1 month of causal wear ie once or twice a week to the grocery store. I would not buy this style again, nor have I visited this seller again.
Right out of the box comfort.  Would have kept them but the heel cup area is way too shallow.
I like the brand  Wore these shoes for two six mile hikes through my community. I was rewarded with a huge blister under my left big toe and the top of my right foot felt as if I had it ran over by a car. I like the brand, just unhappy with this shoe. Buyer beware, you get what you pay for. I went cheap on these replacements and won't make the same mistake twice.
Quality is poor, suspect they are knock-off
Felt that shoe short....toes jammed up. Also little arch support.
Don't waste your money  VERY Cheaply Made!!!! These fell apart after only about 3 months of wearing. Don't waste your money.
Not so Great Anymore  Not the same New Balance shoes I have been wearing for the past 15 years.  Loose fitting with no support anywhere.  Another great skater shoe brand bites the dust.  I'm heading to Merrills for what I used to find in New Balance.
Didn't Fit, sent back  I have wide feet and they didn't fit so I had to send them back.
Not for flat or wide feet  Bought these and used them on about 4-6 miles twice. Well made but I have flat feet and these shoes caused a lot of foot pain each time and some plantar fasciitis because they are so ill fitting for flat and wide feet. Had to return them and bought the Nike Terra Katta instead for trail running and obstacle course races.
Not good for runners
very tight
Slow delivery, less comfort.  I don't normally buy shoes on line but ASICS stopped making this particular model and the ones I bought in the store last year wore out. The replacement shoes took more than a week to arrive and are not the same as the original. While the size is correct, the upper looks and feels much stiffer. After a couple of miles running, they rub my ankles around the opening. Simply put, they are not as comfortable as the ones I bought in the store.
Not to happy with the seller  Not to happy with the seller. Shoes did not have the asics insert in them generic shoe insert that does not fit. Also wrong was shipped with the right sticker attached to contend 3 shoe was used had scuff on the toe. Looks like a return.
Not very durable  I really liked these shoes for as long as they lasted. Within a few months of moderate use the sole started coming apart. Very comfortable shoe, though.
Disappointing  These shoes don't make it from the track to the street. Uncomfortable to wear - no traction. Bad choice for me.
pieces of crap  Do not buy these shoes! I bought these in desperation as my usual Nike faves were not available. If I had realized they were one of Nike's "shox" series I never would have purchased them. WAY narrower than standard Nike's, practically all plastic, including the sole, which has absolutely no rebound. There is no roll, rebound, or flexibility in these shoes. The materials started to fall apart after one week. Do yourself a favor and buy another style. Stay away from these! Gave 1 star because I couldn't give zero.
Meant for modest overpronators  This review is meant for Amazon Purchasing/Procurement Please ask your running shoe suppliers to indicate in the Amazon product description if the running shoe is meant for overpronators, neutral, or underpronators.  Most of the running population are modest overpronators so I suspect, not sure, manufactures are designing "thicker" insoles on the inside of the shoe.  For underpronators, like me, this is the exact opposite of what we need/desire.  For walking shoes, boots, people who buy running shoes but just walk in them this doesn't make much difference.  For serious runners where impact force is much greater, it matter a great deal so this product description that would (1) better describe the product, (2) decrease teturns, (3) might be a good way, better than price even, to filter Amazon running shoe inventory. I hope this review is helpful to Amazon's purchasing/procurement All the best
They are nice but way too narrow  Dissapointed in these shoes. They are nice but way too narrow. We were surprised because we have many other ASIC pairs and this one seems very narrow. Not comfortable. Feels like a waste of money
wish they fit as great as they looked  great looking shoe, but size ran small and shape of shoe forced your foot into pronation even when standing still
This won't work  Received 2 left shoes of different sizes. Not kidding. Will update to let you know how the return goes.
Worse Saucine Guide Ecer  Very disappointed with these shoes. Ive worn them for the past three months and they still feel tight. My feet and toes are always numb after a couple of miles. My feet are not wide and still these shoes are very uncomfortable.  It hurts my calves too.  Ive used Sayciny Guides in several different versions. All were very good!  This one is not. Dont bother buying it.
Two Small and ugly  I have always worn 2E this shoe was not sized right in my opinion. Also when I opened the box the bright, gaudy look of it made me cringe. Photo does not represent shoe well. Shoe also did not have the feel or look I have come to expect from New Balance as I have wore New Balance for years.
the 8 series was the best 10 are just to  constricting
Size 12D more like 11D. .  I wear 12D ad these were about one size to small for me.
Disappointing update to previous version.  This shoe is soft and lacks the strong motion control of previous Saucony Grid Stabil models.  It is not the same product at all.  I developed knee and ankle pain after prolonged use, I have to put them in the cupboard.  The shoes softened up quite a bit after a month of daily 3 mile runs.  It's a great shame, I hope next year's model returns to formula.  I am a severe overpronator and wear quite steep-arched orthotics, but the previous model with the large arch-lock feature prevented me from picking up any noticeable knee pain.  I cannot say the same of this years' model.  I find it quite a mystery as Saucony have had an excellent reputation for providing a great product for this sort of thing, and they seem to have dropped the ball on this.  Impact absorption is not a primary concern when you have control issues. I do wonder why they have done this to their product.
Did not receive what was ordered.  I currently have a pair New Balance M890v...Fantastic shoe.  Bought at local athletic store.  Liked them so much I ordered a pair from AMAZON  ( very good price ).  The shoe I received was New Balance M890SR2  NOT the M890v2 I requested.  Have no idea how to compare the two models. Jim
Don't buy it.
Tight  tight 1/2 size
Dissapointed in the Guide 10's, the Guide 9's were better.  Unfortunately these shoes felt great out of the box, however after less than 20 miles of breaking in the left shoe is uncomfortable to wear.  The heel box slips around allowing the insole to sit incorrectly leading to pain across the arch of my foot.  After having two pairs of Saucony Guide 9's that each have over 600 miles on them and are still comfortable it is very dissapointing that these haven't held up the same.  To make it worse I didn't wear them the first month I had them due to bad weather for running so now I'm just past the return window and out of luck in regards to exchanging.
The shoes appeared to be used and dirty on the inside  The shoes appeared to be used and dirty on the inside,  however he was not posted as used.
small and tight
I got 2 different sized shoes , I'm very Unsatisfied
DONT BUY THEM  Worst purchase ever. After 4 days the part of the back of the surface just broke. Not only from one shoe but from the other too the very next day.  Could not believe. I just throw them away very angry and bought a pair of Adidas that I am totally in love. ASICS advertisement is very good but the product just horrible.
Too Narrow  Too narrow at the front. I already returned them once thinking it was the length, but i guess it wasn't
Quickly worn soles  The shoes are fine for a short period and then as others have mentioned, wear away way too quickly.  I've got less than 50 miles on these shoes and the soles are already worn smooth.  Overpriced for the minor amount of usage I got from them.
Try them on before ordering!  I normally wear a size 11 in every other brand/style of shoe but when I ordered my Saloman size11's I was swimming in them and the fact that I'm deployed its more of a haslle to return. Oh well jokes on me for ordering shoes I have never previously owned before.
As durable as a newborn infant, but very comfortable shoe.  I would have rated these shoes better but they have awful durability.  I've worn them to walk around campus for less than 2 months, I've ran in them maybe 10 times (about 2-3 miles each time), and done workouts in them less than 20 times and the fabric near the toes are ripping out.  I haven't done crossfit or anything intense in these shoes and they are sprouting big holes where the rubber front toe material meets the breathable mesh fabric.  On a 1 - 5 scale of durability 1 being as durable as a newborn infant and 5 being battle hardened soldier I'd give them a 1.5. Otherwise these shoes are very comfortable.  Very light and plenty of cushion.  Perfect fit.  Terrible durability.  I paid over $100 for my pair so I'm pissed that they didn't even stay in good working order for 6 months.
Good, but....  Good shoes comfort-wise , but quality is not there. They started to fall apart after a couple of weeks! We needed to glue the bottom back on! We will have to invest in a different brand. The season is only half done and these shoes will not last.
Sooo Fake and Not Comfortable!!  These sneakers run small AND THEY GOTTA BE FAKE. This is the first day I'm wearing them and my feet are throbbing! The stitching on both the sides are sharp and I'm getting blisters. Im even wearing a thin sock.  They are very stiff! The Nike logo inside was taped on and its peeling off after only wearing one day! The air bubble is not hard and i can't wait to take these off. What a waste of money!
Beware nice for a few weeks then fall apart  Less than one month wearing them and the side blew out.  Tried to return but it was 5 days after when I received them.  Loved this brand till now.
Don't buy  Bottom Grid of the shoe has fallen off now I can not ware the shoe anymore. That s only after three weeks of having them
Toe rips too soon  After 3 months my dream were shattered! Rip on both shoes.
Hurt my toes with blisters.
Feel the road with minimum cushion  These shoes are super light, and you can definitely feel the road. If you need a pair of shoes with comfortable cushion, this is not for you.
The shoe appears to run small
worst shoe I have ever owned  I purchased this shoe thinking that I had found a good deal on a good shoe.  It was on sale for $50 off of the original price.  Before deciding to purchase I read that this would be a good neutral cushioning shoe which would be okay for someone with a supination problem.  This shoe actually makes my supination more noticeable to me.  It feels as if there is no cushioning at all in the front of the shoe and it does not support my arches.  My intent was to wear these in a half marathon.  I tried training in them and noticed that once I reached six miles my feet were hurting pretty bad.  I ran a 10 mile race in them and at mile 7 I was in excruciating pain from these shoes.  I have tried to wear them since and can't get past 3 miles without the pain starting back up.  I can wear my old nimbus 13s and a cheap pair of Adidas with no foot pain issues.  Looks like I will have to find a new pair of Asics to break in before my next half.  I am very disappointed in this shoe.
Where my shoes used? Had hole in them.  Product was damaged, had hole in the thin material on top of the shoe.
Falsely Advertised.  These were posted as the Camejo style in the picture but they arrived as a totally different shoe. Falsely advertised. I was very disappointed.
Disapointed  After 4 months these started to rip on the top above my toes. Super disappointed because I heard nothing but great things. The material is to thin on top and not durable.
Smalls beware  I purchased two pairs of shoes. They were labeled the same size. This was this  The shoe that was too small.
very disappointing!  Have purchased Salomon's before as well and have had good luck till now.  After only 6 months of daily wearing the sole's have come apart on both shoes.
Smh I really really REALLY like these trainers  I returned the item because I didn't even receive the correct the size. Smh I really really REALLY like these trainers, but I refuse to wear shoes that do not fit. They are nice, but they aren't mine anymore.
Fast Shipping  As usual I can depend on Amazon. No one else had my sons size and colors that he wanted except them. I am revising this review based on the product itself. Amazon is still an A+++ company in my opinion, but this shoe was horrible. I am highly upset with Reebok for making such a cheap shoe. I had to replace my sons shoes. The mesh fabric at the top of the shoe ended up with holes in them after just a couple of months. At this price, that should not happen.
horrible shoe to work out in - terrible support for arch.
Fell apart in 5 days
Lack of any thickness or cushioning in the sole makes these unusable.  Fit and build quality is OK.  1 star for the ultra thin cushioning on the bottom.  Only use I can see for these is soft forest or mud with no rocks or hard objects.  I've tried them on a few trails and even a small amount of rocks or hard objects will start bruising your feed after 5+ miles.  I have extremely tough feet as I do a lot of walking barefoot, but for going faster these are horrible.  I've primarily switched to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Nike-Men-s-Air-Zoom-Wildhorse-3-Sequoia-Volt-Bright-Cactus-Running-Shoe-10-Men-US/dp/B01CITNFES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Nike Men's Air Zoom Wildhorse 3 Sequoia/Volt/Bright Cactus Running Shoe 10 Men US</a>&nbsp;for trail running and absolutely love them.
Hurts when running
Not good enough.  These aren't bad shoes, they just aren't what I was looking for (which was an alternative to Nike Free shoes) walking around in. They're smaller and less flexible than expected. They also have a collapsible heel cup that would lead to blisters if with too long. Not getting these again.
Comfortable, but doesn't last  Unlike a few other reviewers here, I thought the Trail Glove 2 was an upgrade over the original in terms of fit and comfort.  However, it is a giant step back for durability.  The originals lasted through a year of fairly heavy use, and I still wear them occasionally--the shoe has held together well, but the sole is worn down, which is what you'd expect from a well-made shoe.  My first pair of this version lasted about 3 months until the uppers started ripping.  The same thing happened with the next pair after about 3 months.  I bought one final pair 2 weeks ago and they are already falling apart.  I kept going back to this shoe because of comfort and because of some brand loyalty, but at this point I'm done.  These shoes are too poorly made for trail use.
Very light weight shoe  It is a very light lightweight shoe which is very good, but you feel every stone that you walk on, it is very uncomfortable when you step on a stone or anything else. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has sensitive feet
Pieces falling off the sole after only limited use. Defective model.  I have had these shoes for one year. I do not run in them; I only wear them for casual use. Yesterday, I noticed that one of the black rubber sections of he outer sole had come completely off. As in gone. For comparison, I have a pair of old GT-2120 dshoes that I have been running in twice a week for five years. No sole problems with those.  My brother has a pair of GT-2000 2 shoes that he bought at the same time as mine. They have also lost pieces of the sole. I have read similar reports from other buyers. Asics clearly has a quality control problem.
Not durable. After a few months, the glue of the sole of the shoe came off on both left and right shoes. I have never had that happen to a new Balance before.
Very disappointed in the quality  I finally convinced my husband to try Brooks! He's an avid Nike wearer. Sadly, after only one month of wear these shoes are fraying and coming apart! Very disappointed in the quality. I own 2 pairs of Brooks myself and haven't had any trouble so I'm confused what has happened with these 
as a whole is not good  It is very light. Although the outside looks net surface, but actually not breathe freely, no technical content, as a whole is not good.
Inferior shoe  Toe area is already ripping out. I buy 4E's just because of that. This shoe seemed smaller than others I've purchaed and is already tearing.
Small
Tried two pairs both had problems  I wear a size 13 in all shoes. So I bought a 13 in these. They were the right length but both pairs had a defect in the sewing that rubbed on my little toe. I had to return them both.
not durable, the glue is too bad
Best shoes ever! (for a short while)  First day worn feet, knees, and even my back hurt way less then my previous shoes.  (I remember the first day wearing these were amazing) After 4 months of ownership I've had to glue the soles back on, replace the cheap insoles provided, the laces broke while tightening which is fast for shoes to fall apart but were simple fixes but now this has been growing for the past month and its time to finally just throw them away. It started off as a small hole and just kept getting larger, then I noticed my heel blistering so I looked inside today to see a sharp hard plastic poking through. For the price I was hoping these shoes were going to last longer. In the past I've bought shoes for $30 that lasted 6 months before anything started falling apart. I will say for 3 months my feet were in heaven but spending roughly 70$ on shoes to only last a month before little issues start happening is ridiculous.
Beware of seller.. not as  advertised  Received these today and NOT BRAND NEW...no tissue in the box either...
Poor Quality and disappointment  Terrible. I went from the Ghost 7 to these Ghost 8 shoes. Completely different  design and not recommended for anyone who has the slightest bit of supination. Less than a month later I am on the search for a new pair of shoes due to the excessive heel, knee and back pain. These shoes are design much wider then the Ghost 7 model and wear out incredibly fast.
Too small shoe opening  The shoe opening is extremely small!
Fell apart in just a few wears!!  The cork fell apart in just a few wears. Amazon will not let me return. VERY dissatisfied with how they held up to daily wear. DO NOT BUY
Not very supportive nor comfortable. Feels to rigid  Not very supportive nor comfortable.  Feels to rigid. I was expecting more from a New Balance shoe.  The shoe fits perfect but I guess if you pay about $50 or less now for a shoe, that's what you get.  I am flat footed and have wide feet so was looking for a less expensive option to my New Balance 990v4's but they are $149 without tax or shipping.  Should of waited to spend on next set of  990's.
Lacing system ruins these boots....  I own several other pair of Salomon boots, so didn't hesitate to purchase these, but let me tell you, the lacing system simply ruins them.  After several months, the strings fell apart, and the lacing eyes are so tiny normal laces won't go through them.  Why Salomon put this "system" on them I have no clue.  It isn't at all convenient, since they don't lace as tight as any other boots.  When you pull the strings tight, there is nowhere to put the extra string, and no matter what you do to "tuck" the extra lacing in it ends up falling out and you end up tripping over it, stepping on it.  It is in a word ridiculous.  The other Salomon boots I own all have great traditional laces, except these, which are high priced junk as a result.  It's a mystery to me, but they are not worth a dime with this lacing "system" in place.
Completely fell apart after 3 months. Junk junk junk!
What's with the sizing?  Why is it that different manufacturers all seem to have their own sizing??  Is there not industrial standards?  So frustrating.  Apparently I am now a size 9 1/2 EE?? I am normally an 8 1/2 normal.
Great Casual Shoe, Don't Buy If You Want To Run Marathons or Halfs.  OK I have had these shoes for about 6 months now and here is my full review, These shoes impressed me when I first started running in them, I run an average of 50miles a week at about a 7:15min/mi. The cushioning was very responsive as expected. I've had Brooks for years and always had good results from the product. This shoe though let me down, after about 200 miles the cushioning no longer responded and the shoe made my feet feel very heavy. Then came the calf issues because of step vibrations that are usually dissipated through the cushioning into the sole of the shoe. I have been a consistent runner for 18 years and never had cushion issues like I have with this particular shoe. The sole wore out very quick as well, for the price I expected more.
Not the Wave Prophecy 2  The Wave Prophecy 2 was my dream shoe.  The Wave Prophecy 3 has been a nightmare for me.  I have run in them a few times now and, every single time, around mile 5, my calves cramp so that I have to stop and stretch and then continue running.  If you have a high arch, this is NOT the shoe for you.  If you are a heel-to-toe striker, this is NOT the shoe for you.  Cough up the money and go for the Wave Prophecy 2.  There's a reason these are so cheap.  Let's hope that these issues get fixed in the future.
small fit  shoe is narrower than expected. I recommend you buy at least a half size larger than usual
These came in a half size larger
Falling apart after 160 days  160 Day Updated Review: Going from 4 stars to 2. I have been wearing these shoes for less than 6 months. To begin with, I loved them because they are wide enough for my feet and were very comfortable. I have worn these almost every day since I got them, this is normal wear for me. I don't run, hike, or do yard work in these shoes, they just get me to and from the store and work. There are many issues with these shoes at this point, but most are my fault. This is with the exception of the soles.  The soles are constructed of a soft foamy layer that adds comfort and a harder rubbery layer that protects the soft portion and gives traction. These two layers have become separated. This is unacceptable, even Walmart sells shoes that last 6 months and I paid quite a bit more than I would have paid at Walmart.  This issue is not with these shoes alone and I have had this happen with several pairs of New Balance shoes in the past, but never this quickly. Even more unfortunate is that this seems to be becoming an industry norm and have seen similar issues with Reebok, Skechers, and Nike shoes.
muy duros y apretado
Cuando me hacen el reembolso ya que no recib el pedido y me toc hacer la devolucin de algo que no llego nunca gracias
Dangerous on wet surfaces  I like everything about these shoes except for one thing. If the floor's wet, you're going down. I've owned a lot of shoes over my 28 year lifetime, but none have been as slippery as these are on wet surfaces. Even if you step accidentally on a wet surface not realizing it's wet, theres zero traction- you WILL SLIP. These shoes are dangerous.. I only wore them a few times and I'm not putting them on again. Of course, now I'm stuck with them since when I tested them in the store, it was on carpet- the problem didn't become apparent till later.
these are just to confining and somewhat heavy - glad my sister wears same size going to give to her.
My worst pair but still did not put me off Vibram  They got smelly real fast, even after washing. I had to throw them away. My worst pair but still did not put me off Vibram. I've wore Vibrams 98% of the time since August 2013.
Shoe fits great, but I believe they gave up durability for lightness  I am a fan of New Balance in general. The fit of their shoes works pretty well for me.  These shoes fit great if you're used to NB and I will probably still buy NB in the future, I'll just avoid this shoe.  I purchased these shoes to do some easy training in, I probably have a total of fewer than 50 miles logged in the month I've owned them.  I just ran a race at a park which consisted of a short trail section and the structural trusses(correct term?) actually broke when I stepped on a rock. The results of which was a pretty nasty blister near the arch of my foot were the break in the plastic piece started rubbing my foot.  I am fully aware these are not "trail shoes" but we're talking a really bad failure of the shoe at just over a month of light use.  I still respect NB and I assume this is an outlier.  I am going to try to email customer support for NB since I'm outside of the amazon return window by 2 days.
Not what they used to be  This is my 5th pair of Asics. The last two I bought the toe has come unglued and the actual soul of the sneaker is not attached at the toe. I guess I will need to find a new sneaker. Any recommendations.  I need a good arch.
Used shoes  I received the shoes promptly, and they were the correct sizes. However, they were used and almost worn out. Who wants that? I sent them back.
Sizing is WAY off  **Be careful with size**For long distance runs, I wear size 11, otherwise for all other shoes 10.5. That being said, I ordered these in size 10.5 and they were WAY larger than even my size 11 shoes.  As for the look, they look exactly as the picture shows.
Stylish, but not ideal for excessive wear  I purchased these as a gift for my husband, as he is always looking for a nice standout "statement" shoe. The bold red color is definitely a win in this department, and they pair well with many different color pants/jeans. Unfortunately he has not had much success with New Balance shoes as a whole, given this is his third pair and he always encounters the same issues. The arch support is minimal, so expect to definitely buy inserts. The biggest issue is for whatever reason, his feet always end up sweating in New Balance after a few hours. He's compared to Adidas and Nike brand, and no other shoes seem to have the same issue for him. Perhaps New Balance has poor ventilation, but whatever the case, he claims that he is comfortable wearing them all day - however you'd definitely not want to wear these day after day, rather let them air out after each wear and give your feet a break.
Poor Sizing  I've been running in these Asic gels for over 20 years and never had a p-roblem until now. It must have been wrongly sized.
Materials defect otherwise good shoe.  I love Merrells and there barefoot line especially, but this shoe after less than 100 miles has a material defect where the soul is peeling apart from the upper with apparently weak glue (see photo). This is a bit disappointing because with my prior 3 pairs of trail gloves I was able to wear them for hundreds of miles until the sole wore through. I am glad and hope they continue to use vibram rubber soles.
Left shoe narrower and has stiff object embedded under the arch of the foot rendering the shoe unwearable  This pair of shoes would've fit fine and provided as much cushion and support I'd expect from such an inexpensive shoe. However the left shoe was not only narrower, but also had some sort of stiff object embedded under the arch of the foot rendering the shoe unwearable. This is a quality control problem. Fortunately I bought these via Amazon Prime so the return was quick, easy and free.
bad
Explain to me why the size 11.5 cost $79 and the size 12 costs $115.  What a rip off.
Ouch  tight width or too inflexible on the outside  (lateral) toe area
Usually wear a size 9 ordered a 9.5, still too small. Very tight hurt from the second I put them on. Back they went
poor quality soles  the shoe worn out in 3 month soles gone and uppers were ok they were comfortable though be careful about quality
Not so good  I bought these to do some light hiking in... we are talking about dirt trails... light hiking, no big deal.  If you live in CO, I am talking about the damn at Lowry and Green Mountain.  Within 6 months.... meaning.. maybe... 60 miles... the webbing on the front was ripping through on both shoes.  They WERE comfortable though.  But, to last 6 months, I would NEVER buy again.
ASICS Blazingfast Shoes Are Not Durable  ASICS Blazingfast shoes are not durable.  I ran in them for 2 to 3 months, and the top started to crack, and allowing pebbles in.  I bought them from the ASICS on-line store, and I was asked to send them back at my expense.  After they received them, ASCIS refused to replace them because the shoes were "worn", and sent them back to me.  The bottoms had a little wear but were not worn.  I still run in them, as long as I'm not on a dirt trail.  I've been an ASICS customer for many decades.  I plan to look at other brands next time.
Not suitable for trail running  Tread started showing wear very early on. Not for trail running!
New Balance has fallen down  New Balance has really fallen down as a serious running shoe . Quality is poor . Cheap light flimsy crap cookie cutter mold everything is the same junk / Really a shame such a good running  shoe , long time ago
If you have tiny, narrow feet, you'll love these!  way too small and narrow.
New Balance - NEVER AGAIN.  The sole held up like (fill in the blank) shoe. It started to come apart after about six months. Pieces of the sole stared to break off. I stopped buying  the $150.00 New Balance a few years ago that I had purchased for years. Instead of lasting two to three years they only lasted a season. In only a few years the quality of these shoes has dropped from great too Poor.
Hot, poor quality, uncomfortable.  Bought these as a replacement lightweight day hiker. I took them on a recent canoe trip to the Rio Grande and used these as my camp shoes and day hiking shoes. The soles are very stiff. The break in period is longer than the 4 weeks I've had them. I wore them all day for 2 weeks before the trip. The shoes do not breathe well and are very hot. The arch support is very high - too high - and is placed too far back. They are not comfortable right out of the box. The stitching has already started to break down. The quick lace system is quick and effective, but because of the design, if you break a lace, you probably have to replace the shoe. They do claim to be Kevlar laces.  The lateral support is very good. Overall I'm very disappointed with these shoes and would not purchase them again.
"Red" in silver/red shoe is closer to pinl  As a few other customers have noted, the "red" highlights in the Silver/Red version of this shoe are much closer to a pink/peach color. I took one look at these and sent them back.
Not a fan.  I get blisters on my arch where the sole meets the shoe if I wear these for more than 3 miles. Tried them with all kinds of different socks and no change. Not a fan.
TOO NARROW AND LONG  THE SHOE LOOKS GREAT BUT IT IS VERY NARROW AND LONG COMPARED TO ANY SIZE 12 I HAVE EVER TRIED. NOW THAT I FINALLY GOT THEM 3 WEEKS LATER I'M ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD ON DEPLOYMENT AND CANT RETURN THEM. A LOT OF MONEY FOR NOT A VERY COMFORTABLY FITTING SHOE. I RECOMMEND TRYING THEM ON AT A RETAIL STORE NEARBY BEFORE ORDERING THEM. THE SIZES ARE NOT VERY RELATIVE. THE BIG TREAD ON THE SOLE IS ALREADY STARTING TO PEEL OFF ITS ONLY MY 3RD DAY WEARING THEM. AGAIN I RECOMMEND TRYING THEM ON FIRST BEFORE YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON A NOT VERY HARD WORKING SHOE. EVERYONE ALWAYS SAYS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, WELL IN THIS CASE I HAVE A COOL LOOKING SHOE THAT DOESN'T FIT ACCORDINGLY AND HAS TREAD THAT PEELS OFF ON THE 3RD DAY OF WEARING THEM. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!
Very poor quality - avoid  My son has had this shoe for less than a month and the memory foam insole has disintegrated to mush (it pushes to the top of the shoe and was never actually fixed on the inside at all - it moved around when your foot was inside the shoe).  Also, the top stitching has disintegrated - there are now holes at the tops of the shoes.  Very poor quality - avoid!!
Most uncomfortable shoe I've ever purchased.  The sewing at the back heel area of the right shoe may have been the work of Ray Charles.
Stitching Came Apart After A Few Months..  Based on other reviews, I ordered a size larger and wider.  The shoes fit relatively well, although my initial impression was light  and cheap.  I felt a need to write a review based on overall quality.  Sure, I may have gotten a bad apple....but.  I have owned at least a dozen pairs of New Balance Shoes over the last 25 years.  Each pair would hold up at least for 6-8 months of normal use, if not longer.  This pair started to fall apart after about 6 weeks of really light wear as in  one to two times a week at the gym.  I checked the return policy and I am just outside it.  Just my thoughts...think twice about these, especially since there are so many options.
I have owned many different variety of Merrell shoes and it feels like Merrell quality has been declining over the last couple .  Bought a pair of these 4 years ago and they fit wider than the new pair, even though they are the same size and width. I have owned many different variety of Merrell shoes and it feels like Merrell quality has been declining over the last couple of years. Time to find a new shoe company...
FAKE  shoes were fake!!
My opinion  This shoe is not for me since I returned one of these .  I cound't return this order cause I soil the bottom wearing them in the house to try them out. this style of Nike  with no support is a bad shoe for me.  i've made bad choices in the past and this is one of them
Not a minimalist running shoe.
They are not wide.  check the charts.  They seem like nice shoes, but the size is not want I expected.  I ordered 11m.  But it wasn't wide.  They were too tight for me on the sides.  Make sure when ordering shoes they are wide or 11e.
Not comfortable.  Very hard to put on.
Returned
Too tight  These size 10.5 New Balance shoes were too small for me. They feel narrow and pinch my toes. Other NB shoes have been fine for my size.
They came already used.  These shoes just came in they are clearly used.  I would not get these ever again.
one star at most  I ordered a pair of white new balance tennis shoes size 11 wide width.  I got a pair of brown non new balance loafers size way smaller than 11 and medium width.  0 for 5, not impressive.  Before receiving money back, they must receive the returned item and I can't make out when gift card will be reimbursed.  I'm not sure all this is worth shopping with these people.
Bottom soul is ripping off in the middle of the shoe
Biggest NB letdown ever.  The shoes were defective and molded with an uneven sole. NB did not stand behind their product. FAIL...
Not a good fit for me
Fghjvv
Poses risk of injury to serious runners...not worth more than $20.00  I bought the Skechers Go Supreme Running shoes which are more or less the same as these....so I'm sharing my review of it because these shoes pose a risk to real runners.  These shoes are very comfortable but they are not suited for runners even though they are called running shoes. The soles of these shoes are extremely soft which means you'll only get about 30 miles out of them or less if you are a heavy runner. Based on the durability of these shoes I definitely think at $70 bucks they are way way way way over priced....these shoes should be sold for about $20 Max due to their lack of durability.  I suspect if you use them for walking they may last a bit longer....just a tad bit.  *UPDATE* I have now downgraded my original rating from three stars to two stars. Just after 5 runs in this shoe I have developed shin splints and pain in the ankle. It seems Skechers has not learned a lesson from it's $40M lawsuit re: Skechers shape ups. The designers in Skechers seems to be more concerned with the 'appearance' and "colouring' of their products rather than it's trustworthiness, performance levels and durability.  No serious runner will consider these Skechers go runs and once the soling of these shoes are gone which occur between 20 to 30 miles runners run a serious risk of incurring some type of running injury, be it shin splints or plantar fasciitis.  Skechers shoes are great for casual wear....I love their styles....but regards running I'll avoid their shoes like a plague because you'll probably end up with an injury.
Sole seemed to wear faster than it should for normal running.
They fit like an 11, I have at least an half inch of extra room in not more...
Defective  The outsole on the left shoe somehow became outwardly curved after just two wearings for squats and deadlifts.  If you put out on a flat surface, it wobbles significantly.  The exact opposite of what you want in a lifting shoe. The right outsole is still flat like a board as it should be.  Very, very disappointed in the quality of these shoes.
Lousy fit  I read the hype regarding the Zig on the heel and thought these shoes would be worth a try.  Beware the upper sole of the shoe.  These shoes have a mesh upper sole that really doesn't do a very good job of keeping your foot down in the bottom of the shoe.  I only walked in them and I could feel a gap between the shoe and the heel of my foot.  There's no way I would bother to try running in them.  I suspect that the Zig really does help with cushion but the upper sole had better be a non-mesh type of material for these shoes to work.  I would pass on these shoes again in a heartbeat.
Doesnt last  Looked and fit okay. However, they lasted less than 20 miles (nonconsecutive miles) before the soles started falling apart.
They look awesome but then you will notice the fit is HORRIBLE  Be careful! These are fake!! They look awesome but then you will notice the fit is HORRIBLE!! Then you will research the model number and realize Nike has NOT made these! Buyer Beware!!
nice light weight cross trainers and they fit great, however the rubber treads are peeling off within a few days' use.  Happened with two pairs I have ordered. Buy shoe glue with these cheaply made sneakers.
Poorly Made  These shoes are cheaply made. I had bought them for my dad and they did not last but about 5 months. The sole of the shoes came apart with only light use. I used to be a fan of New Balance but not after this.
Stick with the GT's  These shoes caused me terrible ankle pain and didn't have enough arch support. Ive been running in the GT series for 3 years now and will definitely stick with them. I thought I was doing good upgrading to the Kayano but learned you have to stick with what works.
Poor Insoles caused a lot of discomfort.  Great looking shoe and fitted great at first but insoles are way too thin with very little or no arch support as compared to my older Asics which caused a lot of foot pain after a month of daily wear. It does not represent Asics legendary reputation, although this is my 5th consecutive pair, would be considering other brands.
Too tight! Hurt to wear.  Too tight!  Hurt to wear.
runs narrow at the toes.
Black shoes turning white  After one 4 mile run (at the gym, not outdoors), the black shoes are turning to white shoes as the material between the threads fall apart.  Don't have a lot of experience other than the onetime usage but it seemed very basic running shoes ( which was light).  I will add more feedback when I have more experience with it.  The size seemed a littler bit smaller than comporable Nikes that I have.
I really wanted to like these but mine had shoddy workmanship  I really wanted to like these but mine had shoddy workmanship. On the left shoe, the part where the tongue is sewed to the body had all this extra bunched up fabric jutting out. It was extremely uncomfortable no matter how loose I tied it. It's a shame because I only have a chance to buy shoes that actually fit me when I make my annual pilgrimage back to the States to visit family. Alas, it looks like I'll be going back to my life abroad with naught but my smelly old Sauc Jazz's. Very little tread left after a year, and they smell like Satan's farts but at least they're comfortable. ^^
Wore these shoes about 15 times, this morning I put them on and the air pocket on the left show was deflated.
ouch  Ran a 15 k in these after only one short run with them before. Bad mistake on my part. Should have broke them in better. Very large blisters on both feet in the exact same spot. With my Nike Luna Glide 3 (my old running shoe) never had to break them in. Nervous about putting these back on now
Small Sizing!  I ordered the same size that I wear in lesser price NB shoes. I buy NB 609's and 481's locally and 12 4E fits perfectly. These were way too narrow/
Not what I thought, I should have got New Balance.
The left foot side went bad last week (May)  I bought this New Balance TOP MODEL shoes ($250) last year (June 2014) and start to use as my running shoes at Feb,2015. 3~4 times a day and about 5k each time. The right foot side part got separated after 3~4 weeks which I have to glue it. The left foot side went bad last week (May). For my $250, I called NB for warranty. What they do is offer me a $50 coupon towards to the next purchase and nothing else. They told me the problem is because I didn't wear it immediately so the glue got dried out. Sorry but this is the first time I heard the shoes have BEST BEFORE date on it.  I did wear other NB products between $20~$100 and I do stock them when it go on sale, they are good quality and I keep them for 1~2 years before I wear it since I have 4~5 pairs. For $250 top model shoes, I was expected more and needless to say, "MADE IN USA" is a big joke. I would like to give 0 star if I can.
Confused to order agin  I order many pairs  of the same model before on size 9.5 USA.. This pairs are much bigger and roll all over feet and crate a rocker arch. And give me a real pain under . No satisfaction any more .
No didn't meet my expectations. Never got product.
Crap!!!!  Absolute crap. Ran 3 races and the sole came off. Dont waste your money!
Not a good shoe!!!  Product is falling apart. I brought these shoes about a month ago and they are falling apart. The stitching on the right shoe is  coming out. I'm a paraplegic man witch mean I can't walk. So there should be no reason why the stitching should be coming out. Either you replace them or refund me my money. I did love them but this is unacceptable. I can't believe that New Balance would sell something so cheaply made.
More "Flash" Than Function...  I must say that the Silver/Neon Orange combination is catchy to the eye, looks as if it was built for speed/cushion and even felt great in the store. Even so, quite simply put, these shoes are more apt to be suitable for cross-training and lighter use than running longer distances. The mesh covering, though very breathable is just flimsy. After five (5) weekends of regular running use, my feet were protesting in a major way.  On a rainy Sunday morning run this morning, I fetched my old Nike Air Max Plus from the closet (with about 400 miles on them) and there was just no comparison, even with the wear on them. The cushion, platform and overall feel of the Nikes is just totally superior....and my knees/feet thanked me for wearing them.  As with the others' comments, I feel that 100 plus dollars is excessive for limited use. There is definitely some need for major improvement to make it competitive in that price range as a running shoe.
Run Small, Not Much Arch Support  These run about a size small and are narrow in the toe area. I purchased the Murietta Clog also, and in comparing the two, the Abby Clog runs small, is not made of as good a quality of leather, and offers less arch support. The Abby clog is also narrow at the toes, so if you like toe room, this is not the right shoe!

cannot recommend.. i liked the design  shoes are too small.  ..cannot recommend..i liked the design.should inform and advise when items sizes are not normal..rating cannot be given, i bought them to wear and now can not wear either pair..
The shoes were not what I've come to expect from Merrill's. They had zero cushion and cost foot pain immediately.
No box or tags  Not original box or tags.  I don't like that.
Returned them  I have a wide foot and these were tight; I returned them.
Material across the top of the shoe and build quality is sub-par.
Split after less than a week of use  Bought the yellow/black ones in a size 10. Fit great, as most NB running shoes do, but the sole on the left shoe started to come off after less than a week of use. Check out the customer pics I'm about to put up. It was really disappointing, and (of course) a replacement wasn't available, so I just returned them for a refund. Normally, I don't have problems with NB shoes, so I can't rate them a 1 star but if this were my first experience with them, that's what they would get.
Check Fit - Don't rely on label size...  I have a pair of these shoes and ordered a replacement in the same size...  Shoes appear to be of equal quality however, Sizes are not true to advertised.  Shoes are shorter and narrower than expected.  The label matches the old label but the size is different. Warning:  Don't wait to try things and return them... 30 day return policy...
These did not fit right, although I purchased the correct size, I will stick with the equivalent Nike's
A rip off - wrong size shipped - no return allowed!  I ordered a 9 1/2 but when received the size was too small.  I had ordered the identical shoes previously in a 9 1/2 and they fit perfectly. When I measured the new shoes against the old the new shoes were about 1/2 a size smaller. When I tried to return them, I was told the return window had closed. I am very disappointed!!! I was ripped off!
Do not buy these shoes.  Do not buy these shoes. I have bought two pairs and both of them were torn after couple of uses on the front top area.
Not enough room for the instep. Returned.
I received the wrong color !!!  I received the wrong color !!!
It was not new and pacakage was horrible
Comfortable, but poorly made  I had high expectations for this shoe, and it initially lived up to them.  The shoes fit well, seemed well-made, looked good, and most importantly felt good running. Unfortunately, both uppers now have three tears (holes) near the seams in the toe box area. I knew the shoes weren't going to last as long as a regular training shoe, but I expected the sole to wear out first.  Well, the soles are still in good shape, but the holes in the uppers are rapidly expanding.  If the shoe sold for $70, I would not be too unhappy, but these are $140 shoes.  Asics dropped the ball on this shoe in terms of quality.
This shoe does not have enough cushioning..  They are not comfortable.  Usually I buy Asics Gel Nimbus series shoes, but because of the look I decided to buy these.  The shoe doesn't have enough cushioning in the heel.  They are very uncomfortable.
Size too small  At least half a size too small. Take your provisions.
Not a good fit.
I will be returning these.
I am very disappointed when I received my shoes because I spent a lot of time looking for shoes in the size 10 (D). That means extra wide. When my shoes felt tight l looked at the size to discover they were a size 10. They arrived 2 hours before leaving the state for a hiking trip and had to use them. Each step made me think of AMAZON. Not very happy.
Beware of this Company  I followed the instructions on what size to order and they arrived and fit very large.  I enquired and was told that was the way they should fit (not having ever had shoes like this)  After two days of running it was painfully (no pun) obvious that I had been misinformed.  After that, a call to the company to exchange for a smaller size was greeted with "too bad."  Great, so I took their advice and have a pair of shoes that I can't use.  Very disappointed.
Incredibly comfortable shoe, but... issues with the sole glue.  Shows are awesome, almost no break in. BUT... the issue is with the glue between the outer sole and toe guard. It comes unglued. My first pair did after 1 month of use (no trail and no running, just walking), so I sent them back, Amazon rocks for returns forget going through Columbia, but the second pair started to do the same, same place. Not happy. I guess super glue will have to do for now.  Edit: So the first pair exhibited the glue problem after only 1 month, the second pair did the same (no trails, no running, just everyday walking and wear) only worse, the whole front and back of the sole came unglued. I am in the process of getting a refund (Amazon rocks for returns and refunds!). Poor construction quality from a once reputable brand, pity. According to a shoe repair guy I trust (he's extremely knowledgeable), the problem is the outer sole is not rubber but some sort of synthetic plastic and rubber, which doesn't glue well regardless of glue type. You would think Columbia would know this, right?
Sized wrong!  No way these shoes are 11.5!! 11.5 is normally a little big on me and my toes are bulging out the end! Really disappointed I have to send these shoes back! Probably be the end of my shopping online for shoes!
Sole adhesive FAIL  Unfortunately, two months after purchase part (black heel portion) of the sole fell off. Out of the warranty period but the shoes look new otherwise. They were not washed/dried/or worn unusually so I wanted other potential buyers to beware.
it fits like a 9 maybe 10  I ordered a sie 8...it fits like a 9 maybe 10. The box was destroyed. Know I don't know what im going to do with these expensive shoes. D
Flimsy with no sole  These shoes started falling apart within two months, and I'm not a runner. Granted, they are super light, but that comes at a huge cost, durability. Moreover, the shoe's inner sole has absolutely no cushioning. Honestly, I don't see how any could run for more than a mile in these things. Buyer beware, given the "Minimus" branding. It's minimal alright.
Sorry shoes
Weak construction - Broke after two weeks of use  Used the shoe for about two weeks now with about 50 miles on them. One of the straps that hold the laces to the shoe has broken. This is the second time a Zoot shoe has failed early on me. The shoes are cheaply made. I do not recommend purchasing these or any other shoe made by Zoot.
Shoe lace came off in a couple of month  The shoes seem to be robust however the design of the shoe lace is really a down side. It has cut through its holding point and now is turned to a useless shoes. The ordinary shoe lace seem to be long lasting in comparison. I'm going to see if I could cut the existing shoe lace off and try putting prong snap botton on and see how that goes.
Ghost 6  is fine just not for me.  This shoe is just not for me. I have other Brooks products that feel better than this shoe. The shoe is fine I just need a different fit
Poor fit, wrong color.  I ordered the Black on Black pair of ZEM shoes in an xxs, which is the equivalent to a size 6 in womens. My feet fit inside the shoes fine, but after just ten minutes of walking around the unfinished seams inside the shoe began to dig painfully into the sides and bottoms of my feet. I really, really wanted to give them a chance. Who doesn't want ninja shoes? Unfortunately the concept is much better than the execution. The stitching inside presses painfully into all of the wrong parts of my tiny, slim feet in a way I'd have never imagined. After taking them off I had severe red lines on the soles of my feet for over an hour.  Oh, and they sent me a pair with silver stripes. Ew. That is not what I ordered. I'm submitting a return request pronto.
I wore these twice during 5 mile runs on a dirt road. The soles are wearing through already. Nice fit but zero durability with respect to the soles of these shoes!
Poor quality. Returned ASAP  Its not the actual shoe. Poor quality. Returned ASAP
Hole in the toe within a year of moderate use (Image attached)!  The comfort of the smooth design and snug fit was a great plus but the net-like fabric (which helps the shoe breath) wore off pretty quickly within just over 12 months of "light" use. This was largely used as a walking shoe (every 3 days) rather than a sports or running shoe. For $90.00 that is such a poor quality. This makes an otherwise 4 star review a 2 star interview. Would have tore off the whole of the toe area had I used this for running. Felt like cheated.
Sole quality  Bought them for my guy and he loved the shoe for running following his foot injury, very comfortable.....the down side to the pair I bought, a month and a 1/2 into owning them the grip on the base of the front toe started peeling off and he said he used them to run in less than 5 or 6 times times...disappointed in the quality in that regard. So I guess buyer beware...
First running shoe to ever cause me problems  I've been happy with my ASICS purchases for over a decade.  Unlike my usual Nimbus buys, I was terribly disappointed with the Noosa.  The fit was slightly snug, but I'm usually not that particular.  Unfortunately, as time went on, I developed sores on my second toes (longest, in my case).  I see that others have complained about the small toe area on this shoe and am guessing that's the cause of the problem.  What was I thinking?  I never needed any of the features offered by this shoe other basic running, and there Noosa has failed me big time.  I'm throwing these out and going back to Nimbus (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ASICS-Men-s-GEL-Nimbus-17-Running-Shoe/dp/B00KO9GLQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ASICS Men's GEL Nimbus 17 Running Shoe</a>).
These don't feel like the sandals  Birkenstock sandals changed my life! My feet are so happy in them, these insoles are NOT good. They are very hard and don't ever seem to soften and mold to your feet like the sandals. I've tried them in tennis shoes and boots and my foot pain is worse when I have these in there! I don't understand and wished they would've worked. Still on the hunt for a winter solution, because I can't wear sandals anymore.
Can't remove the insole, I have custom made inserts and cant put them it. Ordered the wide, could not fit my foot in them. Returned them for a refund.
Too small
The size is way off  I usually where size 11, so I order 11 1/2 just to make sure they wouldn't be too small...and they're too small!!!  Sheesh!!  Trying to send them back.
Narrow shoes  They look good but are very narrow. Not comfortable to wear.
Waterproof? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!  I bought these to walk my dog through WET GRASS in the mornings. Not wade through puddles, not endless miles of running on muddy trails. Within 10 minutes of walking, my feet are soaked. They get a star for good fit and comfort, but the main reason I bought these was for the waterproofing, at which they fail miserably. My leather reeboks from 1994 have better waterproofing than these. If you expect these to keep your feet dry, you will be disappointed. Look elsewhere.
Yet Another Short Lived Shoe  Like other reviewers' shoes, both shoes are torn. Torn isn't even the correct term. The fabric disintegrated. I took a chance because they were being offered so cheap. Not worth it. The shoes are very light, comfortable, good looking, and extremely fragile.  If you like minimalist shoes and don't mind replacing them every 2 months, these are the shoes for you. Otherwise, stay away, even at the bargain basement price.
was not was i was expecting
Poor Quality, Replaced By New Balance  After wearing this shoe casually around the office for a couple of months, they started to develop holes in the fabric around and above the balls of my feet.  I called new Balance and they asked me to ship the shoes to them for a return. They replaced them with another, better-rated pair of my choice at full cost plus free shipping. The old shoes weren't quality, but New Balance made it right in the end.
Poorly crafted.  While I found the shoes incredibly comfortable, I got less than 100 miles in on them before the sole of the left shoe tore of during a run. in 25 years of running, I've never had a shoe disintegrate like that before.
Their size recommendation wizard recommended size 10  Way too small. Their size recommendation wizard recommended size 10. I have worn New Balance size 10 before. This model wasn't even close.
Did not fit true to size  The shoes were way too small. Unfortunately I will have to send them back.
Not a smart purchase  The bottom has already started lifting off the shoe and I have to paste it up for my husband to wear it. I think I will try another brand next time.
Trail glove 2 are better  I had the first trail glove and loved them. then I got the trial glove 3 the inner sole below the laces came apart and rubbed all over my top toes. And it feel more like a shoe then a bearfoot glove. So yeah I returned them and got the trail glove 2 there the best. I love them I recommend getting the 2 not the 3.
Plastic like material won't stretch out  Sized too small.  I have a high instep.  Plastic like material won't stretch out.  Soles seemed slippery on wet rocks.  On the shelf
Too narrow and not at all comfortable - wish I could return them.
Small shoes  They are to small for me, I've tried in shop and size was ok is it possible to change it?
Too small
Not worth the money  First pair of Asics I have ever been disappointed with. Starting ripping in the front mesh in only two weeks, and now both shoes are coming apart in the toe area.  They are my daily shoes, and don't get pushed very hard at all, in fact I haven't even run in them yet, just worn to work and out and about.  Very unacceptable to spend this kind of money, just to have to discard a month later.
Nice shoe-Too small  These were too small for me, not by much but small. I returned them. These were purchased from The Shoe Mall; through Amazon. I had to pay for the return. If I have any problems with the refund I will update this review.
