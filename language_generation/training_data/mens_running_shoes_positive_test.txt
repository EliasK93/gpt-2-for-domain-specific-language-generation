Quick delivery and quite comfy
You get a good shoe if you can afford the price.  I like the combination of support/padding while also staying light-weight. My only quip is they lose their "fresh" look really fast. Worth the coin in my opinion.
great product  great product and quality only adidas can offer your fans. the sending was done so quickly and arrived in the estimated time
Perfect
Awesome shoes for running  These shoes are super flexible and very lightweight and there is plenty of ventilation for air to get into your shoe.  I suspect that rain and cold would get in as to be suspected.  No experience with that yet. Nice to run in.
Good quality  The sandal is very comfortable. I ordered a 39W, and it's too wide. I returned it and reordered a 39N. good quality
Very comfortable.  Just what we wanted. Very comfortable.
Decent buy.
comfortable durable have had for over a year hold up great.  Shoes are great for crosstraining and shorter runs 3 miles or so
Excellent cushioning, good fit, very comfortable
Happy Customer  My Husband Loved them!.
Flat footed husband....  My husband really needs motion control shoes.  Had one pair of these and wore them out.  Great support and balance for the flat footed.  So glad we found these.  Have been trying to find the right tennis shoes for years.  Have had way more expensive shoes but none as good as these.
Runners..if you hate the typical shoes sold in the store this is the shoe for you  I hate nike, brooks, and a lot of other typical brands for running shoes. They all look the same, and blend together in a bunch of BLAH. I love mitzuno's for their great color, and vibrant look. I always get compliments on these running shoes..oh and by the way not only do they look great ..they are the best running shoes ever. I have wide feet, and these fit me fine with no issues.  They are light, and provide lots of air especially on those long cardio days where you are sweating like a whore in church.  I will never buy another brand of running shoes again. I am now a strictly Mitzuno man.
Nice  light and comfortable
Hurt Achilles  Just like Nimbus 15, they hurt my Achilles tendon (mostly from pressure while driving and sitting so not sure if running-only would hurt). Otherwise a  great shoe.  I'll have to research comparable brand's styles for those of us that run on the outsides of our feet.  Update: The tendon issue resolved when I added a insert pad. Great shoe. Hope '18's are the same.
verry good for gym. I been using asics snekers,i had frackture  spinalcore so is give me the suport went i work out.
good advice  My size actually is 9.5D, but I ordered 10D for this product. It is because I saw another website recommending to order a half size up for New Balance shoes. That's why it fits me as expected. I really appreciated that information I found elsewhere. By the way the direct road-feel you get from the Minimus in walking(in my case) translates nicely into an immediate pedal-feel if you own a car with manual transmission. With an accurate pedal-feel like this you might enjoy shifting gears manually even in a traffic jam.
GREAT SHOES.
Great walking shoes  Husband loves these for work since he has to walk a lot.
Great fit extremely comfortable
perfect for running.  Awesome shoes
good enough
I love these shoes it fits as expected and very light!!
My hubby loves this shoe
Best OCR shoes I've had... Best all around trail shoes I've had...  I've been in search of great, not good, OCR shoes since my Inov8 285s bit the dust eariler this year.  Had Inov8 continued producing the Roclite 285s I would have purchased another pair of those.  I tried a pair of Icebug Zeals.  They are fantastic shoes and would have been my choice, but they are just a tad too narrow.  Fine for short distances, but hell on my feet for anything over 5 miles.  If they had fit I may have never found the Mutants.  So glad the Icebugs didn't fit.  I bought the Mutants on a lark, having had a pair of La Sportiva Wildcats for a few years that I used solely for backpacking.  My experience with La Sportiva shoes has been great so I gave the Mutants a shot.  The Mutants are pretty light for the size of the shoes.  They do not look anything like minimalist shoes, but they don't weigh much more than minimalists.  The lug pattern on the sole is very aggressive, and the shoes seem to be built for off trail use only, but they are surprisingly very comfortable and as responsive on dry, hardpacked trails as they are in the mud and goo.  The unique tongue and lacing system are like nothing I've ever seen or tried before, but they work to really hug your foot into the shoe.  Compared to the other La Sportiva shoes I own, these are a tad narrower, but not so narrow that they become uncomfortable over long distances.  I wore these shoes on multiple training runs in preparation for the 2015 Spartan Race Beast at Killington, Vermont.  I had zero issues with chafing or blisters on any run, including when the shoes were brand new out of the box.  I trained in varying conditions from dry to deep, heavy mud, and never slipped in these shoes.  At Killington, these shoes proved that they belong on the list of great OCR shoes.  I was able to navigate technical off-trail descents MUCH faster than I was ever able to in my Inov8s.  I think that was due to both the upper style (tonges and lacing) and the aggressive tread.  Depending on the soil, the treads would hold a little mud when traversing long mud fields, but a quick flick of the ankle would remove the mud.  On wet foliage, the shoes felt glued in to the ground.  In all of the steps I took on the mountain I had zero slips.  I would recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a great shoe for OCRs or for trail/off trail running.
Sweet shoes!  I have to stand on concrete during my work hours, and these helped my feet tremendously. It's like night and day. I highly recommend them to anyone who has to stand on concrete for a good amount of the day. My feet hardly feel sore after 8 hours. These shoes offer great support for me since i'm flat footed as well.
A good shoe at a good price.
Amazing lifting shoes  Amazing shoe for wider feet. I generally wear a 9.5 - 10 wide, so I got this in 9.5 and it fits perfectly.  The toe is a little flexible for more dynamic moves, while the heel is solid for heavy lifts. It definitely helped improve my ability to deep squat and provides an excellent platform for squats
comfortable and good for running
GREAT!  I already bought another pair!
Great Running Shoe, Highly recommend  I am currently in the US Army assigned to an Airborne unit.  We run often and for long distances.  The first time I wore these was on a 6-7 mile run, on pavement, gravel, and dirt roads.  They were very comfortable, light, and provided good protection against items in the road.  My feet feel great and I will use these for as long as they make them.  I highly recommend these if you run for long distances and run on various types of terrain.
Great shoes!
Whee!  Big red shoes for my big flappy feet!
Very comfortable to walk with  Fit as expected. Very comfortable to walk with.
Comfortable shoe for walking  My first pair of these shoes is starting to wear out so it's time for a new pair.  These shoes fit great and are very comfortable walking shoes.
Great Shoe  Love New Balance shoes. I have been using them for their box type tow and wide sizes forever.
I LOVE Vibram shoes  I LOVE Vibram shoes. I own 4 different pairs of Vibrams and each one is equally as awesome as the others. I bought this one more specifically for the gym because its sole would allow me easier movement while doing leg workouts from squatting to even calf raises. I love the color of this pair, it's a nice red color with the light reflector lines( that look like spider webs haha). They have lasted me through everything from the gym to even hiking (when i was out of town and only had these with me) and anything in between. They finally got tears in them after having them for a long while and using them extensively. I will definitely buy these again, and again...and again. haha!
Positively surprised  I needed a new running shoe for muddy, outdoor trails.  The last one I had for this purpose was the Saucony Razor, which had a similar design as this one.  Whatever Saucony has redesigned in the Xodus 2.0 makes it much more comfortable than the Xodus "1.0" or the Razor.  This shoe comes highly recommended. It is a bit hot in the summer but very comfortable.
GOOD  GOOD
Love the Merrell shoes.  I started the transformation to minimal running a couple of years ago and have really enjoyed running in Merrell shoes.  Ran my last marathon in Merrell  sand set a pr by over 15 minutes. They take a little get in used to but are so worth it.
LOVE!
Does what it is supposed to do.
They fit great and feel good when you run, also very light weight
Super shoe  Brilliant shoe. Looks great, feels light!
Comfortable, cute and light weight. I love them
Awesomeness  Awesome wish the whole japanese connection were available
Original Hoka Clifton was so much better than the 2nd version.  So excited to find the original.
Classic style and comfort
Perfect!
Get 1/2 size larger   Great shoes. Usually wear size 8 but 8.5 fits. Free returns so no big deal. Really good job manufacturing these shoes. Seems some Chinese producers are really stepping up their game! Great shoes.
Solid running shoe  Ran a marathon in these and they held up well.
Great shoe but runs small  These shoes are really nice but they run too small.  Had to return for a larger size. My son loves them.
EXCELLENT PRODUCT. SELLER WAS A PLEASURE TO DEAL  EXCELLENT PRODUCT.  SELLER WAS A PLEASURE TO DEAL WITH
Great PI shoes  I'm a big fan of pearl izumi.  There shoes, and these shoes in particular are light, super comfortable.  I usually use them for walking, but have used them hiking and they are comfortable.
and I do love both of them  this is my second pair, and I do love both of them.
Reebok realflex  Great for walking. My 3rd pr.
That you sell this sneakers  Fit good
Nice shoes
Great for my job
Feels good for basic workout  Little large for size 11. Maybe 11&half. Feels good for basic workout
excelent
My favorite pair of shoes because of the perfect comfort  My favorite pair of shoes because of the perfect comfort. Just snug enough but extremely roomy to walk in all day. I have back problems with certain pairs of shoes but rarely does my back hurt wearing these shoes.
i love them.  so confortable, i wasn expecting it. great buy.
Great Spikes  Bought these for my teenage son. He tried these on along with the Nike Zoom Superfly R4.  Both felt good and similar but he liked these better. He likes how the tongue of the shoe is not a separate piece but is part of the shoe so feels more like a sock. He hasn't raced in them yet but tested them out at the track the other day and liked them a lot.
Versatile, fits my needs very well  I am an old guy with some issues with my feet (neuropathy, some swelling) and these shoes accommodate these issues and are light weight and comfortable.  If you have similar problems try the D width and perhaps a half size larger than your usual size and  you may have good results as well.  I bought two pair.  Since I wrote the above review, I had to send the shoes back!  The black soles were making black marks on our wood floors.  I replaced them with another pair of Avias without the black soles, and these are fine.
Great product!
Great shoes  Great shoes!
Amazing  Nice shoe!
Well constructed shoe. My other pair are still going strong after 3 years with only some scuffs due to my own clumsy walking. They have a small arch support which is welcome for me, as I cannot walk long in completely flat shoes.
Great shoes  Bought these for my son for his crossfit training. He loves them because they are light weight and very grippy.
Good good good
Favorit Running Show  I keep buying the latest version of this shoe as it fits like a glove is light weight and can take a very tough running schedule.
quick and hassle free purchase  Quick delivery, fit as expected. Very happy with purchase!  Great to deal with just like my other transactions never a problem, easy way to shop.
Buy in bulk  The thing I hate about New Balance shoes is that they change the models. You find one that fits and looks good, and then they wear out, and you can't just reorder the same shoes when the old ones wear out... you've got to go to the store, try new models on, and then order that model online... repeatedly until they sell out.  I recommend buying in bulk when you find the ones you like. Sadly, I didn't do that with this model, but I should have. Next time. New Balance are great. Just wish they'd keep "mine" in stock so I could just reorder instead of buying in bulk.
Like wearing socks.  Wow are these comfortable!
Very comfortable!
Very good  I've both this one because a friend recomended. I'm quite pleased whith this purchase. It's very light and confortable, has a very good support and flexibility. The only problem is that I fell it a little bit tight in my foot. Maybe ASICS should offer a wide option for his products. Alexandre
BEST SHOES EVER  These shoes are by far the best pair of running shoes I've ever owned. I run between 20-50 miles a week, and these shoes never cause me any problems. Buy these shoes, they are amazing!
but looking forward to taking them for a nice long run  Have only worn them around the house, but looking forward to taking them for a nice long run!
Beautiful shoe, fits perfect!
Great pair of really cute shoes.  First impressions: I love the shoes. They look great, and seem durable. Make sure you read the sizes. I ordered my size but in a men's and had to exchange. I'm an 8.5 in women's, which translates to 7 in men's. Hope this helps.
Cool and confortable.  Very confortable.
Excellent running shoe.
Light weight and comfortable  So far I have played soccer, made four 2 mile runs, worked all day on my feet for 2 weeks in these shoes. They have less support than my origin solo's, but my feet are doing ok. I wouldn't run a half marathon in these, but they are good all around. Very light weight and I'm not seeing any material issues like I saw in some comments. I like them a lot so far.
For my grandson.  He loves them  For my grandson.  He loves them.  Very good quality and sharp looking.
Great shoe  These shoes are perfect. The feel is better than expected. When I need another pair, I'll definitely order again. Thank you
Great shoes. I have a pronation problem  Great shoes.  I have a pronation problem, and these shoes fit great and have felt great.  I have experienced problems with other shoes, but have had no issues with the Gel-Nimbus.  I am only sorry that I didn't switch to them sooner.
Best zero drop trail shoe on the market  About my 4th pair and perform exactly as advertised. Best zero drop trail shoe on the market.
superb shoes  recieved it on time and it is a great pair of shoes  GO FORWARD NEW BALANCE  NEW BALANCE FOREVER AND FOR ALWAYS (y)  NOTE: I am a proud new balance user <3
Great looking shoe!  These shoes are very comfortable and are a minimalist shoe meaning they are lightweight, thin material and great for running or working out.
Good durable and perfect fit
Lightweight, Great Fit - Love It!  These are really great, all-purpose shoes. I wear them to work, to work out, to run, to hike, to shop...everywhere. It fits as expected and is extremely comfortable. I got it on sale for $59.99 which I thought was a nice bargain. The quality doesn't feel like it will last FOREVER like some shoes, but I would expect them to be in the $70 range.
Sneaker Junky  They fit perfectly and they are much better looking in person. The color and material on this shoe is stunning. I'm a sneaker junkie and even more of a new balance junkie. They're a perfect fit to my collection. I would recommend buying them.
Comfortable  Good price. Good work shoes.
Nice fit and quite lightweight.
Fit good
Son loves these running shoes.
Great shoe.  Great price on a top of the line shoe.
Fits great!!!  I always worry that a shoe that says 4E will actually be wide enough for my feet.  These fit just right, not too large and not too narrow.  They felt comfortable the first time I put them on.  I never go by the suggestion to break them in since what gets broken in are your feet.  I will buy these again if they are available
First time buying shoes online. With the shoe program, I was a little relaxed. Shoes arrived and fits as expected
fast delivery to him in Afghanistan and he likes them so I'm happy!  Husband is deployed and needed new shoes, fast delivery to him in Afghanistan and he likes them so I'm happy!
Love these shoes!
comfortable shoes  This is the 1st pair of Saucony Triumphs that I have ownedIt's very comfortable
Great shoe for the price. They are literally like cleats!!!
Great value for money.  Great steal at great price. Nicely fits my feet.
They are great shoes
The best I've ever owned  Hands down the best running shoes I've ever owned. They're a little stiff when you first put them on and the heel drop seems huge but once I was a mile in... the absolute best. I ran 15 miles the first time I put them on and they just got better with every mile. Note that I've generally run in pretty minimal, neutral road shoes from Asics (Gel-Lyte 33, Gel Excel). Highly recommend.
Exactly as expected.
Bought the as a gift and he loved them!
Very comfortable and great price. Stylish running shoes and seem to be durable.
These are my favorite shoes. I've had very flat feet my whole life. I walk 3-6 miles every day. New Balance is the only way for me. Thanks!!!
A great value and comfortable shoe for all kinds of activities  Great value, comfortable shoe and does well on 4-5 mile runs.
Max-Cushion with Natural Fit  Great max-cushion-shoe for the road and well groomed trails. As usual with Altra, the shoe provides Zero-Drop and a footshaped toebox with plenty of room in the forefoot area!
Perfect wide width  I have really bad feet that are very wide.  This is actually my second pair of these because I wore the first ones out.  That says a lot because my feet hurt a lot and I have a very hard time finding shoes that I'm comfortable in.  The width on these is perfection.  That's probably the worst thing for me is finding a shoe wide enough but these are awesome.
One of the most comfortable running shoes I ever owned. Definitely would get another pair.
Great snicker  Got love them pumas this is my 3rd pair in a different color
Great shoe for everyday running  I use these as my everyday runners (4-6 mile runs).  They have great traction, good stability, and after several months, are holding up rather well (at around 500 miles and still with tread!).  I recently upgraded to Brooks Ravennas being that I am a much more serious runner, but use those on my longer runs (6-12 miles).  I would highly recommend this or the newer version (1150) for anyone who is a casual to moderate runner and tends to be on the heavy side (i weighed 180 when I bought these, 155 now).  Great cushion and stability and comfortable for overpronaters.
Great shoe stretches a little after first wash so it was a little snug for me at first since I'm in between sizes it worked out great
Love these  Terrific shoe for work, stays comfortable all shift
These shoes are amazing very comfortable and made very well i have tead some reviews where some have said they are not that comfortable wrong these are great out of the box thanks mizuno
I have liked the lunar glide line for some years now  I have liked the lunar glide line for some years now. Works great for those who need more control and arch support. This one delivers the same if a tad bit better performance than the previous generations.
Perform as expected  I have pretty much standardized on ASICS running shoes for the last 7-8 years.  For me, they have been consistently comfortable and provide the cushioning and support that I need.  I'm happy with these GEL-Cumulus shoes and they are performing well, as I expected they would.  They've even been endorsed by my granddaughter with a "I like your new shoes!".  What more could you want?
Great shoes!  All of my kids wear them and love them. Light weight and cool during running.
Great shoe! It fits perfect and super comfortable. I love the design and makes it stand out. Definitely recommend.
Great
Consistent quality  This is my second pair of Saucony running shoes. I was intruduced to the brand by my brother who also had a successful experience with it. The company has built a reputation of putting a lot of thought and care into their products and the triumph 9 is no exception. These shoes are light but durable, the cushioning is outstanding and if you are a heavy runner (which is my case) you will have a very pleasent experience running in them.  Take the time to visit the company's website if you're a novice runner because they provide a sensible guide to selecting exactly the model that fits your needs. If you do so, then just hit the road and enjoy.
Good shoes!
Awesome shoes for hanging out.  Too heavy for running though.  Still love them.
Great Comfortable Shoes  The shoes are excellent, in perfect shape.  They appear to be very comfortable from the start, I am looking forward to wearing them while working bike patrol.
Love these runners  Very comfortable shoe.  Plan to buy another pair
This is the first Shoe I have found that nurtures the foot I damaged hiking the Continental Divide instead of aggravating it! If only I had these then!
Ultra...that fits  I have two pairs of the first GoRun shoes that came out, and now that I have these I really don't want to keep the others.  They feel great on my feet, and leave me to focus on my breathing, stride, and time when running, I strongly recommend them to anyone.  I have put several dozen miles on them already and I see no reason why hundreds more aren't in their future.  Aside from that, their neutral color make them decent for casual wear too, awesome kicks guys.
Great shoes
Cool shoes!  Son loves them. Really good looking shoe.
You will love it im buying again from them  This guy's are awesome the shoes I ordered were awesome I give this guy's a 10 for how quick I got my shoes and how comfortable they are if you are looking for someone to buy shoes with get this guy's you can't go wrong
Would buy again.
Another great pair of Salomons  The quick tie laces are nice.  The shoes fit very well and are comfortable all day.
It is an excellent shoe for a flat-footed overpronator like me  I've been running in ASICS Gel Foundation for several years. It is an excellent shoe for a flat-footed overpronator like me.
Perfectly ok.
Great Fit!  I usually have a break in time with other shoes. No break in time for this shoes. Supper breathable material help keep me feet dry regardless of how much i run.
Great durable breathable shoe  I'm regularly a size 11. Bought the 11.5, though I tend to buy a half size up on running shoes. This is my second pair of the same model. First pair has lasted me 400+ miles. Love the breathable mesh top, makes it feel lighter than it is.
Excellent  Excellent running shoe!!
Good Running Shoe  Very comfortable running shoe, fits well and I do not have any pain in my joints after running.  I run 3-5 days/wk @ 3mi on average.  I run more for exercise than for fun, and my feet are a bit wider than most.  In cheaper shoes I usually end up with pain in my shin or knee even after stretching and duck walking(build muscle across shin)
very satisfied
I love these shoes  I have not run in these yet...will update asap. The out of box fit is amazing. I was worried that they would be too narrow so I went up a 1/2. LIKE S GLOVE. I think I have a slightly wide foot thus the concern.  AFTER 3 MILE TEST RUN on mud ,hard pack n loose gravel uphill n down I've never felt more surefooted on the trails than with the speedcross. I'm glad I went up a half size it gave my foot a bit xtra wiggle room. No pain or sore spots. Awesome shoe
Comfort and Value  Usually I wear Asics but decided to try these Adidas trail shoes.  They're very comfortable and fit well.  I've received lots of complements on the look.  I see from the other reviews that long time Adidas customers are saying these shoes are a bit too firm for running, but they are designed for trails and the firmness is a plus.  If you run on hard surfaces (road or sidewalk) you probably want to select a running shoe and not this trail shoe.  Good price and they're holding up well after six months.
Perfect  Good looking, practical shoe. Excellent fit.
Fit is amazing.
but the fit is good and the comfort is acceptable for now  I'm still in the "break-in period", but the fit is good and the comfort is acceptable for now.
I love Asics running shoes  I love Asics running shoes, and have been purchasing them for over 10 years now. Their sizing is consistent enough that I feel confident enough to order any pair online.
Comfortable Day In, Day Out  Love these Pumas and am sad they are no longer manufactured. They are the most comfortable day-to-day sneakers available.
god fit  I normally wear size 8 medium but decided to get 8 W. shoes fitted perfectly and were  comfortable during the first round i played
Excellent comfort  These shoes are great. I was running using Puma shoes previously, and these new balance are much better. Those dang Chinese pumas are not comfortable for running at all. I'm very happy with these shoes.
Love these shoes. Like walking on clouds!
Awesome!  I've been wearing Merrell True Gloves for a couple years now in casual use. I decided to replace my Vibram KSO's (rubbers completely gone...) with these. Great for running and since they are a bit thicker I expect the rubber to last quite a while.
It fits and it's nice
perfect
Good so far.  Only wore these shoes 3 times.  I bought them to play Table Tennis in.  All natural rubber sole was the selling point for me.  Addidas is a premium product and there was no reason, so far, to dispute that. They fit well, solid material's (bottom to top). Some times shoe companies send free products to try out you know. Sooooo.. keep my address, aha?  Point Pilot
Is my partner to running  Very good shoes, don't weigh much have a gel that support all the cushion when i jogging, is natural, never go out with them.
Very nice, my son loved it  Very nice, my son loved it. He said its very comfortable knowing he has wide flat feet issue. It's so problematic to find the right kind and fit for him even in store so finding it here in Amazon was the terrific. It's a regular not wide but comfy enough for him.
Very good track shoes for the price.  As others have noted they tend to run a bit small.
Never disappointed. Every year a new pair though  Gel-Kayano since 25 years. Never disappointed. Every year a new pair though.
Another great shoe from Vivobarefoot  This is my fourth pair of their shoes and they all make my feet so happy.  These are much lighter than the others I have; will be great in summer!
AAA+
Summertime Favorite  Love this style of shoe. I have it in 4 colors.
Very Good & Highly Recommended!  - Been using this shoe for yeas now when I go out sometimes and its very good with the slim and clean design.  - Also very comfortable and very light are it's highlights too.  - Very good & highly recommended to every guy.
Wife makes fun of me  On my second pair of the same shoes! Wife makes fun of me, but I love them!
Nice
Perfect fit for WIDE feet!!!
Great product, great transaction,fast delivery, product matched description
Excellent  fit.
Holding up to tough kid  My 19-year old son is hard on shoes, and tends to run through sneakers pretty fast, but these appear to be holding up OK.  He likes the classic style and low-key color (he bought all black with the 3 stripes).
comfortable shoes. Soft but supportive soles  Very light, comfortable shoes. Soft but supportive soles. Upper breathes extremely well. Fit is very close to Nike and Mizuno. Outsole (striking surface) seems pretty thin. Not sure how long it will last before it wears through. I will post an update if the soles indeed wear through quickly.
5 mi the other day and they were great!  Jogged 9.5 mi the other day and they were great!
happy with my buy
The heel material on the right shoe detached after just a few weeks of running 15 miles per week
I have four pair of Mizuno's  Great shoes.  I ware them one or two times a week working out. Thanks a bunch!
The perfect (well almost) Asphalt shoe  I don't live in an amazing place like Portland, where running is as much a part of life as McDonald's is to a seven year old.  I live in Texas, and to be more specific West Texas.  There are no beautiful, rolling hills with wonderful, cushy trails on which to patter your feet...there is asphalt.  Asphalt and the twist and turns of residential neighbourhoods with barking dogs and cars driven by old ladies that can't help but steer their Cadillacs in your direction because their hands follow their eyes.  I, like many of you , wanted to see what this "barefoot revaluation" was all about, so I did my research and made the "transition."  I have to say, I'm now a believer.  Also, like many of you, I own five or six pairs of minimalist shoes because we are all looking for that Holy Grail.  I had heard of this unusual shoe company that I could never remember their name, and when I did, felt kind of stupid saying it because it was not short and catchy and didn't rhyme with bikey or basic.  It was quite by chance that I ended up with a pair of Vivobarefoot Ultras anyway.  I had read all the great reviews about the Evos, but they were too damn expensive and heavy.  Amazon had a pair of Ultras for $50 or so, so that was my opportunity to try out this company at a more affordable price.  I got the shoes in, and long story short, grew to LOVE them for the types of roads that I run on.  Many Ultra wearers don't use the insert, I do.  Many complain about the sizing issue, if you're going to wear the insert, size up, if not, stick to your normal size.  Some complain about the squishiness of the shoes as well.  Maybe they're too soft for Portland runners, but after 10+ miles on asphalt, a little squishy ain't bad.  Now the bad news.  According to Vivobarefoot, these shoes are not really designed as a pure running shoe, therefore the sole is not as durable as the famous Evo sole.  Well, at a third of the price of Evos, and with good technique (that red "V" on the bottom of the sole is there for a reason), I've been able to get 300 miles out of my Ultras, so far.  I think I'll get a couple of hundred more.  This makes them almost the perfect asphalt shoe, for me.  If the design team would put just a bit of rubber across the ball of the foot, I think I could almost double that.  That's why they are ALMOST the perfect asphalt shoe; durability of the sole is a bit lower than ideal, but then again, they are not designed for what I use them for exactly.  If you are like me, have transitioned to minimalist shoes, and run mainly on asphalt, the Ultras may fit the bill for you as well.  If not, then they are worth it just to wear and try to explain to folks exactly what those things are that you have on your feet.
they last twice as long as Nike Airs and are most Comfortable shoe I've ever worn  This is my 4th pair of Asics, they last twice as long as Nike Airs and are most Comfortable shoe I've ever worn! I'll never wear another Tennis Shoe!
Awesome shoes!  Great zero drop shoes and a compromise for minimalists.  Like running on clouds.
running with Asics  I have been using this high quality brand for years. This shoe has not changed my mind on the product.
Good shoes!  Good shoes and a great value when priced right.
Nike Air Max Torch 3 Black - Perfect.  Love them.
Nice Shoe
Excellent shoes with good support. Worth the money.
nice
Good price for a dependable  Have been wearing this shoe for years through different iterations.  This pair has the same fit but does seem a bit lighter.  Good price for a dependable shoe
Excellent looks, fit  Excellent looks, fit, everything.  Comfortable and easy to put on as well as quick+easy to tie with this weird shoelace design.  Note for new users: it took me several days/week+ to break them in. They felt weird and were hard to get on until after like a week or so.  After that, though, everything about them is perfect.
I typically wear a size 10.5, but I wear a size 11 in this model so my toes don't get pinched.
Love these shoes and I will continue to buy them
Amazing shoes  this shoes are confortable, soft with a low weight, perfect for running or training.
classic.
Perfect racing shoe.  Perfect racing shoe. Comfortable. Very light yet still good cushion. I train in Nike Pegasus size 11, and I bought these in size 11 too and they fit & feel just right.
shoelace design are all great  Fit, durability, comfort, shoelace design are all great
perfect  This running shoe is perfect in size, by appearance and by price! High quality product with affordable price! I do recommend it to anyone who is looking for the practical nice looking sport shoes.
very good
Love UA!  AMAZING!!! 3rd pair bought!
Super deal worth twice what they cost  These are awesome!!! I work on concrete all day and walk miles each shift and my feet really love these shoes
Great shoes for runners who need medium arch support  Great shoes for runners who need medium arch support. Best suited for runs on unpaved trails but I also use them on pavement and they hold up great. Beware of wet rock where soles become very slippery.
The shoe is FANTASTIC! As and elderly jogger with knee and back issues I need something a little softer underfoot. At the same time I need the stability control found with high end running shoes. This is it!! This shoe also makes for a really nice walking shoe.. Note, shoe size is as advertised. I purchased another pair at a local retailer who suggested a half-size larger. I made the assumption that I should do the same online. My mistake. I just re-ordered the same shoe with the my correct size.
wonderful  love it
Great running shoes  Feels amazing.
This is the second pair that I have bought for my husband.  He wears them when he goes fishing.  They are light weight and dry quickly if he's fishing a tournament in the rain. A bit pricey but he likes them and that's all that matters! Would buy them again.
Very comfortable, very light and looks sharp and elegant without being flashy. Perfect sizing for me. Use it mainly for walking on fairly gravelly rural roads. Satisfied with performance so far.
Couldn't be better  My husband loves these so much, he got me a women's pair!  He's training for his first marathon and just raves about the cushioning.  No knee pain with these!  Hoping I have the same good fortune with mine!
Great shoes  If you are looking for a versitale pair of shoes for running or training these fit the bill perfectly.
Super shoe !  These are not over rated footwear ! They are a get what you pay for item and they are pricey ! They fit great, run great and traction great. This is a great color as well. Solomon has some really off the wall colors and color combos so it's hard at times to get the Solomon you really want. Speed lace are as advertised and are fast and stay secure. I have to tuck the overlap in the side of shoe as per norm with this lacing style. If you have a wide foot the solomons I have will not fit you ! They are very form fit. Time will tell on durability.
AWESOME pair of shoes!  Awesome shoes, love the fit and they are very easy on my feet.  Use them ALL day long at work and for my 10 mile walks everyday!  Perfect pair of shoes, will purchase another pair when these need replaced.
perfect track shoes. light weight and well fitting
Good product.  Good product.
Top of the Line  This is my 2nd pair of Asics, but I didn't appreciate the 1st pair.  This shoe is unbelievable.  My right achilles has been sore from the Nike Air Max 2014's.  I've ran in this shoe 5 times now and I can't believe the comfort and cushion.  I'm an Asics believer now! ps I tried on the Brooks Adrenline 15 in the store as well.  One on each foot.  There is no comparison.
Excellent Shoe  I have been trying to find this shoe, maybe not by number or name but by quality. I have a very old pair of NB 892 shoes that I jump rope with, they are about 15 years old and still are stable with cushion. I have been trying to find the same fit, feel and cushion in an NB shoe. I decided to spend more money and I wanted an all USA made shoe. TA DA....this is it. Great shoe.
The Fellraiser is a great shoe for USPSA Practical Shooting  The Fellraiser is a great shoe for USPSA Practical Shooting. I would say the best.  It is a more proper shoe in the classic sense, with more aggressive and larger cleats than the Speedcross 3.  IF you have a wide foot, I would strongly advise buying the next size up when buying Salomon shoes.  I normally wear 13's and I wear a 14's with Salomon shoes.  This is my 4th pair of Salomons.  Great shoes, and quality for the money!
Fit a bit small  Other reviewers commented that NB shoes fit small so I ordered a half size larger than what I normally wear. They fit fine and have been comfortable during my walks.
Husband loves his shoes
kswiss tubes......  great running shoe.  lightweight and durable.  the open tubes at the bottom make walking very easy without putting stress on your heels or toes. great shoe, will purchase again....
GREAT FEEL  I AM A FEMALE AND NEEDED A WIDER RUNNING SHOE, MENS SHOES RUN WIDER THEN FEMALES SO I PURCHASED, GOT COMPLEMENTS ON THEM TOO, PLAY BASKETBALL IN THEM TOO LOL
good running shoes  will buy it again if on sale. :) Run a marathon. Good shoes.
Fit for all day 
Excellent shoe!  Excellent shoe! Really confortable, that gives necessary support for running. Really worth the price. And it's also good looking, so it can also be used to walk around anywhere.
great comfortable light weight shoe  Because of serious back problems I don't run any more but was looking for a comfortable shoe for the "torture" of walking distances and these are great.  After years of having very structured, anti-pronation, motion control running shoes Im starting to believe they caused more problems than help.  I have no back pain walking in them, wish I had them when I ran.
Good shoes. - They are wearing down a bit quickly, however I am also much heavier than the average user so I expect such wear and tear. Quite comfortable for me despite working in retail on my feet all day.
Perfect, beautiful, soft.  Perfect. Good for work, running, be in home. I don t no about the durability /longlife because stil new. Its very sweet for run and be elegant with denim / jeans
These are a great product. They are very comfortable and provide a cushiony feel to my feet. I will purchase these again when needed. I replaced the blue laces with black so they don't look so flashy.
beautiful shoes. i did not calculate well the size and ended up being too small.
Great shoes  This is my second pair of Reebok Men's Realflex shoes. They are well made and are perfect for either running or long walks.
These shoes are great! I've used them for races from 5ks to 20 mile runs.  They are extremely light and breath really well. I have a rather wide foot and I heel strike more than a lot of runners, but these have kept up wonderfully!
Great price, great shoe.
great shoes, love them  I got these ones as I didn't like the newer model. I have both Kayano 20 and 19. I still like 19 a bit better, though I did get used to 20 as well in time. Great padding and comfort, it's a pleasure running in them.
Excellent shoe
Asics produces good quality shoes.
Best shoes for standing around on concrete I've ever worn.  These shoes are amazing. Spent all day on my feet every day for 2 weeks at Disney World. Usually, that kind of standing around on concrete would absolutely murder my feet. I would be looking around for any and all opportunities to sit down and take a load off of my feet. But with these, I woke up every morning feeling fresh and ready to go. They're AWESOME.
nice looking sneaker and comfortable
they feel like heaven. They hurt a lot initially though  As a first-time Birkenstock buyer, I found that the shoes broke in my feet, rather than vice versa. After about 2 weeks of constant wear, they feel like heaven. They hurt a lot initially though. Love the tobacco color, it is super neutral and matte. The fit is true to size, but if you have narrow feet, they do run slightly wider than expected.
very confortable shoe  Good value for the price.  Fashionable color.  I recommend and would buy again at this discounted price with free shipping!
The best ever!  I'm 6'5", 250lbs and run 5Ks four times a week.  These shoes are the best ever! They're so comfortable, durable, and provide a lot of stability/support. I have 3 pairs of them. I heard the GT-2170s are basically the same, but the GT-2180s are redesigned. I'll probably order a couple of pairs of the 2170s so I'll be set for a while.
Nice shoe  Comfortable, nice shoe
Good mud shoe  I bought these shoes for my first tough mudder last year. They were great felt comfortable and didn't come off in the mud. I am going to be using them in my second tough mudder this year.
very confortable!
Trail shoe  Great shoe well made. Comfortable with plenty of interior room. Good looking and a good value for the money they cost. I like the looks of them.
most comfortable pair of shoes i've even owned, fashionable as well
Great Pair of Sneaks  Great shoe, very comfy, not quite as nice as ultraboosts, but for $100 they are killer. Haven't tried running, but great all-around shoe. I got tons of compliments my first day wearing them. I wear 11 in Stan Smiths, Sambas, Vans, and have wide feet, and going TTS was perfect for me. A little snug, but perfect length and I can tell they will shape to my feet. Would recommend!
Great seller! Great Product! Arrived faster then expected! Would recommend!
Great shoes!!! Upgrade from old roshes
Best running shoe I've ever owned  Best running shoe I've ever owned, hands & feet down!  Never wore Mizunos upto this point but this is my third pair. Great support & stability for someone with a normal arch.
Love the shoes
Glad to have a new pair!  This is my second pair of Gel-Venture 4 Running Shoes from Asics.  My other pair had many miles on them and I intend to do the same with these.  I am true Asics fan when it comes to running.  This is a perfect shoe for both trail and road running.  Two types of running I strive to do while living and running for life!  A great shoe all around!  Thank you!
My favorite Shield. I've had 4 pairs of these at this point.
5 and it fir perfect! These shoes are fantastic and look cool  I ordered a size 11 wide and it was actuaaly a little too wide and not long enough. I sent them back and ordered a standard 11.5 and it fir perfect! These shoes are fantastic and look cool.
great comfortable shoe  great comfortable shoe
So comfy  I have a bad back (spondylolisthesis) and I'm a college student at University that has a very large campus so I have to walk a couple miles a day. Every other shoe I have will cause me incredible amounts of pain by the end of the day, except for these. They are ridiculously comfortable and are the only shoes I can wear that don't cause me pain.
FFit and comfort great from the get-go.  Grandsons think they're "cool".
Best running show for Afghanistan!  I ordered these June 16th. They arrived June 24th! Not bad at all since they were sent to me in Afghanistan! A medic here recommended these to me due to my severely flat feet I've had since birth. The extra support and stability really do make a difference. Obviously, this place isn't like the US. We don't have great running surfaces here. Even the best roads are still dirt and there are a lot of large stones along the way. I just took these out for a spin and first shot the difference was amazing! I would recommend these to anyone running in the boonies but especially out here. And if you also have messed up feet like I do you'll really appreciate the way these running shoes help you out.
great shoes as advertised.
Good products  We considered these products are good and we are very happy with this. I so happy with the products, but the Spark Go pieces don't work all.
Super!  Stunning! Great look and feel! Good quality too.
Outstanding shoe  Great fit, great comfort, great look, great design and great shoe overall. The mesh in the toes is a great idea for ventilation.
absolutely love these, fit perfectly  absolutely love these, fit perfectly, great for rough terrain. (I'm currently in Iraq) and wearing them 15 hours a day is still no problem.
These shoes went to my son-in-law who is an Oregon Duck fan.  He loves them.
Good fit. Comfortable memory foam, too.  Comfortable and good for a hike in the woods.
Great for neutral runners and long runs.
Great purchase.  Fast shipment.
Very Comfortable
Foot Sheathing for champions!  I really love these shoes..  I have ordered this model so many times and keep coming back to them.  I have a pretty high arch and rarely find insoles that have the arch support that these do.  I wore Keen Hiking shoes before but the ventilation of these shoes allow my feet to breathe more comfortably.
Excellent running shoe  The minimus running shoes are great for running but not great to walk in.  The lack of cushion on the heel makes them very uncomfortable when walking for long distances.  Running on the other hand is wonderful.  Its like your feet have become so much lighter and agility.  The one major downside to any minimus shoe is that you feel every pebble or branch you hit.  It a slight bit uncomfortable but the overall feel of the shoe makes up for it.  One word of advice is to start running slowly when you first make the switch from traditional running shoes.  since you are using a different part of the foot it puts strain on different muscles.
Excellent
I recommend it for you!  Fabulous shoes and super comfortable the size is fit as expected I strongly recommend it for you, I use it in my work and in my jogging too.
The transition to Altra's is worth the wait!  I love Altra Instincts. Ever since I switched to Ultra (albeit it was a long transition period), I know longer experience recurring foot or knee pain.
Love these shoes.
Comfortable and light  I do not run much in these shoes, but do wear them to walk and stand.  They are very light, but do not have a lot of support.  I even wear them to school where I teach.
Great shoes. It is really comfortable and has a great design.
Absolutely love this shoes. Can't wait to get my acid wash overall joggers  so I can be styling.
Excellent  Excellent
Fits perfectly
good shoe.
Onitsuka Tiger's Ultimate 81's are comfortable, light and look great  Onitsuka Tiger's Ultimate 81's are comfortable, light and look great. They fit true to size, I wear a 10 for all the shoes I buy and these fit great. I own multiple colors of this shoe, 8 to be exact and can't wait to buy more, they hold up to use well and I have not had any problems with any of the pairs I own.
Very comfortable after working 14 hours in the hospital ICU  Very comfortable after working 14 hours in the hospital ICU unit
I love the Gel-Nimbus 17  I love the Gel-Nimbus 17. This is the second pair I have bought over the last two years and they are a well performing shoe that really help with my high arches, plantar fasciitis and Morton's Neuroma (with orthopedics).
Purchased this shoes for walking and running. Very very comfortable. Wish I would have purchased these the first time.
Great shoe  This is the most comfortable shoe I have bought in a long time. I plan on buying another pair very soon. I am around 220lbs with a bad back and I feel great when I work out. I run about two miles in them, but lately have been doing box jumps and my feet, legs and back are fine. It definitely gives me the support I need.
Shockingly comfortable!
Will buy again.
Comfortable, light weight shoe  I purchased this pair of shoes to use at the gym.  Based on the price and previous New Balance shoes I had purchased this shoe met all my expectations.  The shoe needed almost no break-in and felt great the moment I put them on.  The bright neon colors (I chose green) is apparently the trend these days but I don't feel these are too overwhelming to the eyes. Overall very pleased with this great pair of shoes after a half dozen trips to the gym.
Ready to hit the trail.  Great fit right out of the box.
Great shoes!  Bought for my Husband and the fit was perfect. He is happily wearing them as I write this!
Great, lighter running shoe!  Great running shoe that is lighter than my last Nimbus pair from a few years ago.  Great fit and cusion without the weight!
Comfortable and durable  Very comfortable right from the start thanks to memory foam insole. I probably put 1000+ walking miles at work on my previous pair before one finally started coming apart near the toe. I liked them so much I ordered another pair. If I had to find a negative it's that the soles are a little squeaky when wet on hard floors until they break in a little bit.
Fit and look great
NEW BALANCES ARE AWSOME  I USE TO WEAR NIKE SINCE I WAS A KID ONCE I TRIED NEW BALANCE NEVER WENT BACK TO NIKE NEVER WILL NEW BALANCE ROCK
Love these shoes  Excellent fit and support.  Perfect shoes for my moderate overpronation.
Lightweight great all purpose shoe  I usually get a 12 but I decided to go with 12.5, fit is prefect. Lightweight great all purpose shoe.
Love it  The shoes fit as expected and I love how light they feel vs my other running shoes.  Great for traveling as well as they fit into my suitcase much easier.
The best, fits accurately!
Great  Good shoes
great shoes
Great running shoes
thank you!!  happy new year!! great shoes!!  exactly on the size, and width - arrived very fast. the product is beautiful, comfortable and excellent for me.
The are perfect.  Loved th they look great what a great gift, also perfect for exercise. I would recomend them to any one.
Great shoes  Amazing iteration of an amazing shoe. Felt a little tight across the ball of my foot at first, but has gotten more comfortable over time. Still my favorite shoes for backpacking.
It's amazing stuff. I like adidas sneakers. It's very comfortable and reliability.
good product fast shipping
Knees and archs... problem solved  I'm 5'10, 200lbs, 33 with bad knee pain and  a left foot collapsing arch. Skateboarded, ran and snowboarded for about 15 years... (my knees sound like the microwave popcorn on movie night). I got these shoes at the high end of the price range due to breaking point pain that day. It was worth it!!! 3 weeks later I feel like hopping on my board again. Glucosamine over the time helped too. Do it and you will echo us. These shoes are hot in August but if you have pain and walk or run alot you wil be very happy in a couple weeks or so. 5 stars! JP
Super great for runners with flat-feet!  I have a semi flat feet.  I looked around for a while before committing to this pair.  I must say, they are great.  I replaced the lining with "Spenco Rx Orthotics" and honestly i can run outside or on the treadmill for a good 5-7 miles and still feel great.  Great arch support, especially with the added Orthotics.
Great general purpose shoe.  Like others have said about shoe size, I ordered one size larger than what I normally wear on Nike products and the fit is great.  Comfort is great; there's no pinching.  Arch support is a bit thin but that does not bother me.  After wearing a few times, the shoe has broken in already.  Great shoe.
Nice looking shoe
Buy these when they are cheap  Pretty good for the price.
Great workout shoes.
Great shoes get them if you jog.  These are awesome shoes! Got them on Sunday, put them on and went on a 3 mile jog. Usually my 54 year old knees complain after jogging but not with these beauties on. I am wearing them today after another 3 mile jog and they are comfortable for just wearing around work. Breathable, good arch support, great treat and no breaking in period.
Excelente calidad
Felt really comfortable from the first time I put them on  Felt really comfortable from the first time I put them on. The laces are WAY too long in my opinion. I will update this review once I get some miles on them.
Good
I really like that the tongue isn't separate  I really like that the tongue isn't separate, because it otherwise always slides to the side. The only annoying thing is that I need to double-knot because otherwise the laces will come undone.
Well made and a decent price.
Great show! Always seem to come back to these!
AWESOME STUFF!!!!!!
I'm usually a 10, got a 10 in these and they fit perfect for a running shoe which is to say plenty of toe box room. These shoes are the best for ground feel, take your time adjusting to them, but there is really nothing better. I prefer to wear without socks, and they breathe great. Also, these shoes are head and shoulders above the "knock off" version of them you may have seen (also for sale on Amazon.) I tried the knock of version myself and they weren't comparable in fit or quality, not even close. These are great shoes for running as well as casual.
good shoe  Best shoe I've ever had for heavy mileage weeks
Very comfortable  I'm new to running so this is my first pair of shoes that I've bought. I'm very happy with my purchase, they were very reasonably priced. They are light weight and feel great
140 dollar msrp for 47.00 ,can not beat that
Excellent Extended Size in Navy!  Bought these for someone else, could never find extended sizes in a navy athletic shoe that wasn't a million dollars. Thank heavens for New Balance! Wearer is very happy!
These shoes are very comfortable to wear.
Good shoes my new  favorite
Awesome for people who overpronator. The first wide shoe that I have found to actually be wide.
New Balance Mens shoes  because the shoes are comfortable from the minute you put them on, this is the 2nd pair ive bought , the first pair I had a year and I tend to pick the men's shoes because they are wide and very comfortable, I hope the shoes are still offered when I need a new pair, or maybe I should buy a pair now and just keep them in storage so I have a pair and I am set for 3 years.
WILL BE ORDERING THESE AGAIN:  ONLY WISH THAT THE SIZE I ORDERED CAME IN OTHER COLORS.
Good shoe  Good product and good fit. Would recommend for others
Great shoe!!!  Ran a spartan super with these shoes, durable and did great on a rocky, uneven, trail! Water did not stay or absorb into shoe as I was told this would happen by a sales associate at a local trail running shoe company in the city I live in.  Very durable shoe and highly recommended!
They're  great shoes, this is my third pair and I've alway had super performance from them.
A great show, comfortable and durable  A great show, comfortable and durable.  I was worried when they were hard to find, seemed like they were scarce.  Good to find at a good price!
Shoes for your Sole  These shoes are amazing.  You know when your old shoes go bad gradually and you dont' realize it? Same here, until I tried these shoes on and walked my usual distance.  My old shoes are bad and these shoes are awesome.
Amazing shipping speed!  Bought the shoe for its color to compliment all of the orange in my wardrobe. (My son's school color) Really impressed with the fit and comfort of the shoes. Received the order extremely quick,,, amazing!  Now I've got to buy my wife a pair,,LOL!!!
Another great purchase  I own 3 pairs of these for the lateral support. They are insanely comfortable and feel tight on my foot.
Great Sneaker  I've always been a fan of Adidas Response, and these do not disappoint. And kudos to the seller for a crazy fast delivery!  Pros: LOTS of cushion. These were suggested to me as a "heel striker," and they provide excellent padding not only in the sole, but also on the uppers. Stability Mesh helps keep the foot cool I think they look great  Cons They're NOT heavy, but if you're looking for a super light shoe, these might not be for you (because of how much cushion they have!)  These shoes are what you expect as a basic running shoes. No bells or whistles or fancy new technology. Just great cushion and durability.
Good buy  Was I little apprehensive about buying shoes off amazon but they came in exactly as described and fit perfect.
good price
Good
I'm very happy excellent sneakers more comfortable than Nike
Amazing
Great fit.
Great fitting, soft shoe  I have had these about three weeks now, fit great, very comfortable, and soft to walk on. I stand a good deal at work and these made it bearable. Do not have a lot of support and is a very flexible shoe but so very comfortable.
Good Running Shoes  FINAL REVIEW:  Its been a great shoe. I noticed my pinky toe starting to bulge out the side a bit. If I could Id like to try on a pair of 2e or 4e shoes sometime. The tread wear on these shoes vs. previous Kayanos is a little different. I noticed it wear more on the palms of my feet and edges more. Maybe my form got better OR perhaps it was moving to Michigan and running in neighborhoods more.  I should have upgraded sooner but was waiting to feel pain in my feet to indicate that it was time. Usually I'd buy a new pair 4-6 months of running. Today was the day with sharp daggers in my left foot palm that shot through to the top side. Im now moving onto the Kayano 21 Light show hopefully by Thursday.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product//B00IEVZ5WA/ref=twister_dp_update?ie=UTF8&psc=1  INITIAL POST BELOW:  Kayanos have been the "go-to" running shoe for me since the 14s. I was rolling my ankles every run with Nike Shox, lacking comfort in Solomons, and the only shoe that gave me ease of mind and way less pain has been my Kayanos.  So far so good. Just got the new 19s because I was starting to get shin splints in my right leg/ankle in my older 18s shoes. I weigh 215ish lbs and run about 90+ miles a month - 6.5miles at a time. I'm sharing my size and routine because my 18s only lasted about 5 months till I started getting shin splints, and heard weight/mileage to be a contributing factor.  The 19s feel more light weight, more "grippy" (maybe because they are new), and It feels as though the shoe is correcting my role onto the outer edges of my feet more. Not in a weird way where I feel like Im going to roll my ankle or anything.  I have not experienced arch issues in these shoes yet and no burning sensations like I've read in some of the few negative posts which made me look for the 18s in stores but decided to try the 19s anyways.  I did go a half size up this time to 11s. They felt better, hope I don't regret it later. I also like that Asics is putting some love into the Kayano design/aesthetics a bit more and hope to see more. I like a flashy shoe for athletics, the neon green highlights is a nice touch.
Good, comfortable!
Good shoes  These seem to be just like the Air Max shoes sold in the stores. They seem to be every bit as authentic. I have had many pairs of Air Max shoes that were purchased over the years (starting around 1995), and I also purchased a cheap pair that looked exactly like the air max but were from some seller over seas (not through Amazon mind you). That pair were horrible feeling on the feet and I could totally tell a difference. So with that being said, this pair does not feel like a knock off. They feel completely authentic. They have held up well to lots of abuse so far from me. I would definitely buy these again.
Good stability shoes  I was pronating badly on my left feet and started aching near the heel area.  After getting these, pain did not get worse after runs (2-3 miles average). I only wished that I have gotten these sooner so there would be less injuries on my body.
Great shoe  True to size.
Great !
I have recommends this to others and they like this shoe to  I use these for playing table tennis.  This is my second pair.  I have recommends this to others and they like this shoe to. What is important is that the sole is ONE piece.  The Somoa look like the Samba but it has a glued on sole that come off and can't be glued on.
very comfortable and stylish,  will get another color soon.  i love the support/springiness
Progrid Ride 3  They are "SOMEWHAT" small...however once I put them in shoe trees and stretched them out and wore them, they were fine...I really needed size E in width..a 9 1/2 is too big
Good for everyday wear  Love these shoes!!! Great for my feet, which are wide and flat.
VERY pleased with this purchase
great  Love it.good looking shoes, very comfortable. I will recommend this shes to all my friends. Thank you. Very nice shoes.
I like running in these shoes more than I thought I would  Back in the day when I first started running long distances (26.2), I wore first and second generation Mizuno Creations, and I loved them.  As I switched to running shorter distances (10k, 5k), I started using lighter shoes like Precisions, Ronins, Mushas, Hyperspeeds (Asics), DS Racers (Asics) and ST Racers (Brooks), figuring that I didn't really need the extra cushioning / weight.  The lighter shoes were frankly much less expensive, too.  But when I saw the Enigmas on sale for $70 (including shipping), I thought I'd give big, cushioned shoes another shot.  I was a little worried that the shoes might turn out to be too hot or too heavy / clunky, but that hasn't been the case.  The ride is smooth, and the cushioning is excellent.  The first few times I ran in them, I kept thinking to myself that I couldn't believe that I had been going without cushioned shoes for all this time.  I rotate these with other shoes like the Hitogami 2, and the Enigma 4 performs well in comparison.  Surprisingly, my fastest several runs during this period have been in the Enigmas.  Since it's been super hot (summertime), I haven't been going race pace -- just shooting for a comfortable pace -- so I'm not sure it would mean I would be setting PRs in the Enigmas, but it probably reflects the superior comfort of these shoes.
love these
comfortable shoe
Awesome quality for price! Will buy again.  Very light and super comfortable! Also super breathable, great in the Summer!
Great Hiking Shoe!!  I love this shoe!! fits great, light, and lasts all day long through rocks, mud, rain, etc.! Plus looks great with jeans on casual rainy nights!

They are worn on the golf course and are comfortable for the 5 hours or so spent with them on.
Decen't shoe  For the price I like them nice and light and already better than the junky Sketchers I had I am not a 4E but the 2E's were like a regular sized Shoe so I sent them back
Great!  I love these shoes. Great quality, good shock absortion and stability. Outstanding fit for slim feet. Recommended.

I have owned these bad boys for over a year now and I cannot recommend them enough, they never make my feet hurt or anything, I am also someone who walks nonstop for 9 hours a day.
Working much better than I was expecting.
Light and Solid  So far So good!!
We buy a pair every time one wears out  My husband buys a pair every 6-1yr. He doesn't use anything other than Asics gel-frantic 5. He keeps a pair in his Amazon cart just in case he needs another pair. Really great sneaker, very comfortable!!!
I LOVE these shoes  I LOVE these shoes. They are so comfortable. I no longer have any foot pain, and forget I am wearing shoes. Don't ever change these shoes.

Great Value  You have to love Asics
Very comfy  They look good with jeans or shorts; I wear them to work and my feet don't hurt at the end of the day. They do run a bit large, as mentioned in other reviews, order a half size smaller than your reg and they fit perfect though. Definitely not going to be my last pair of Onitsukas.
Comfortable sneakers
Trance 5  These shoes are well made and very comfortable.  They have excellent cushioning and stability for running on pavement.
Best shoes ever! Really keeps the snow and water out. Feet feel warm on a crazy cold day.
Other then ordering the wrong size these shoes are great.
Comfortable and durable performance  I wear a size 15, medium width.  These shoes are light and comfortable for my long walks on trails and roads. Based on my experience with  a similar pair of Columbia trail shoes I have worn for two years, I expect this pair to provide me with long and durable performance.  I trust Columbia and have never been let down.
Very nice so far  I work 12hours a day and my plantar faciatis has not acted up. If you have a very wide foot these would be tight. So far so good with these shoes
Perfect
On time and exactly what I expected
Great Value  I love these shoes.  They are very light and comfortable.  They are described as water resistant/proof.  I had them on while washing the car and my socks never got wet.
Great shoes! I love my Brooks!
Perfect!!!!!!
Always a good shoe  New Balance always fits well. A very comfortable and well made shoe.
Great for crossfit but not running.  This show is great for crossfit without running. I wear these any day there are less than 400m of running at a time as there is almost no arch support but they are great for lifting and any other cf movements.
The one!  Just amazing! I never take a pair of shoes so comfortable! and also they look so pretty! try to believe!
Fits good but just a little big I should've got an eight instead of the 8 1/2 but I like him
Like it very much
Great shoe
Perfect Fit, best buy so far!
Love the way they feel when running  Just as I hoped.  Love the way they feel when running .
I have been running for eight years now and this are by far the best i have worn!  Great shoes and priced right!
Hoka's fit great!  I am very satisfied with the speed of delivery. The packaging was good and the shoe is a great fit. I am pleased with my purchase.
Great Shoe  Great shoe - LOVE THEM.  very comfortable and durable
Got them at an unbeatable price. Already used them for a several hour walk through the city as well as windsurfing. It's kind of unusual to slip into these at first but you get used to it. They give you a protected barefoot feeling.
Plush, light trainer that should be a crowdpleaser  First off, these shoes are an Editor's Choice for Runner's World in the March 2015 issue.  I was already a fan of the Kinvara series due to their light weight and good cushioning, particularly for speedwork and racing.  However, I needed more cushioning and support for long distance runs. I started looking at some Hoka models, but found the toe box too small for my fat piggies.  I also have peroneal tendonitis,so the guy at the running shoe store recommended the Triumph ISO, to avoid binding on my mid foot.  The ISOFit system for the upper gives a sock like feel to the uppers that does not bind anywhere.  The toe box is generous, but you may need to go up a half size, because the shoes ran a about 1/2 size small for me. The fabric on the upper is almost gauze like and very adaptive.  The laces are used to stabilize the center of the foot with a rib like polymer support system.  The collar of the shoe has a very plush padding system that reminds me of memory foam.  The PowerGrid plus sole is extremely light.  The sole depends on a honeycomb type design in the center area of midsole. This design reduces weight and improves impact absorbency of the sole.  The edges of the mid sole are composed of more supportive material.  The bottoms of the sole are a modified waffle design to improve grip on unstable surfaces and also aid in absorbing impact.  The net result is an extremely soft feeling shoe at a relatively low weight.  The shoes ends up feeling much like a Hoka Clifton without the bulky midsole.  The Triumph ISO design provides the feel of a racing flat in a package that should take high mileage.  Overall, this shoe should perform well in a long distance racer or for faster distance training (intervals, tempo work).  I think the shoes looks better on my feet than in the picture in the blue and yellow color scheme.  If you are a fan of the Kinvara, then you should love these shoes.  At 10 ounces, they are much lighter than they look.  The shoes remind me most of my beloved Ghost 5 shoes, which were light, durable and fast.  The Triumph ISO shoes are not cheap, but they are very well engineered and designed to carry you a long way in comfort.  Update:  These shoes have carried me close to 200 miles now, including the Chicago Marathon.  I am 6' 1" and 175 pounds and run mainly on the road.  The wear I am getting out of these shoes is good.  The soles look like they will easily go 250-300 miles without much of a problem.  Understand that I am very tough on shoes.  I am very pleased with the construction, because the uppers still look brand new.  So pleased, in fact, that I just bought another pair at a deep discount from Amazon.  I even got a color that I like better, because the blue yellow and orange were a little flashy for me. If you are a neutral runner that needs a lightweight distance trainer, then you may like this shoe.
Great shoe fits perfectly!
Great shoe  Cant beat Asics at the moment.
Excellent shoes. Very confortable.
All was fine on my order and I would order again.
Amazingly comfortable  Great fit and feel.  Light weight. Everything I was expecting and more!
Very comfortable shoe.. also very light weight and great for long distance running!
Love Running in Vibrams  This is my fourth pair of Vibrams to run in, and the third pair of Bikilas. This was the best deal on the correct size and color I could find when it was time to replace the last pair. Amazon got them to me in 2 days (Prime shipping), they fit and are what I ordered.
Very comfortable! Fit is great
Driving Shoes...  Vivobarefoot Ra Shoe works the BEST for driving with NO HEEL, good feel on the pedals and they are LIGHT :)
Great Shoes  Great shoes.  Very comfortable and reasonably priced.  I would buy again
Very good for wide feet  I tend to have wide feet ,these shoes are perfect for my gym .I have lessons of kickboxing and the shoes protect my feet very good from damage , in short very comfortable shoes fit for the wide feet
Will buy another pair.
would buy again  My husband loves this shoe to walk in~
Finally!  Let me start by saying - I am not a running enthusiast. I'll do it, but cycling is really my thing. But I do want to get in better running shape. One problem I was having with running is pain in my shins and knees, most likely attributable to my very flat feet (and the fact that I'm not exactly built like a runner). After reading a number of reviews, I decided on this model and couldn't be happier. Went out on the first run in the new shoes and was essentially pain free. The shoes are snug, but in a good way. They definitely are not oversized in the least. With many shoes, I can get away with a 12M (dress shoes, etc.), but for these,  a 12 wide was perfect.  Can't say that I am looking forward to running more, but with these shoes I certainly don't dread it like I used to.
A great looking shoe that feels good on your foot. VERY happy.
Great shoe for OCR  I use these shoes for Spartan Races, trail runs, etc, and love them. Plenty of grip, lots of support, they fit well, and the speed laces are awesome.
Great shoe, light, and fits perfect for wide feet
Love the non-marking non-black soles.  I recommend this shoe to anyone who wants to wear shoes on light floors or carpeting and does not want to leave dark marks.
Real nice and fit good!
Adidas.. awesome.  Adidias has been my go to athletic show for sometime now. The fit is always perfect... the style is always something new and exciting and the comfort is unwavering. Adidias Alphabounce is no different. The unique style and supreme comfort is what I have come to expect from Adidas. Keep it up!
They were for my husband and he liked them and said they are comfortable.
they are very comfortable, thank you
Perfect....  These shoes are great if you have foot problems, nothing to rub annoyingly on the sides of the feet. Great service, ordered Friday and received it on Monday.
love these kicks....great daily drivers
Good as always!!!!
nice shoes
Delivered as promised
I ordered New Balance because they take the beating I put them through over a years time. I have bad arches and need orthotics so that is the reason I responded "No" to the one question. I need more arch support than any shoe provides, so it is nothing against this shoe. These shoes are very comfortable and very sturdy. I walk around 2 miles a day and go on longer hikes and so they will have many many miles put on them. I am very satisfied with New Balance and they are the only shoe I buy. They always have high quality and are very sturdy.
As much as I enjoyed the 608v3 these are even better.
Excellent  I gave 5 star no matter I purchased it like a gfift because I'm also bought same line but different style and color. For me are awesome, for my friend too.... We will continue with Mizuno.
New Balance Men's MX608V4 Training Shoe, Grey, 10...
ORDERED HALF SIZE LARGER AS RECOMMENDED BUT SEEMED A LITTLE SMALLER THAN PREVIOUS PAIR THAT SIMILAR STYLE.
Excellent  Excellent product. Exactly as advertised.
Lite Race shoe  These are great for races, they are super lite, and comfortable/supportive. I will buy these again when my first pair wear out.
Good shoes for the money  The memory foam is great, the shoes fit well, and they're comfortable for exercise. I've put about 80 running miles on them and they're still wearable. Would recommend.
Very Comfortable Shoe!  Very comfortable right out of the box. I have a narrow foot but they fit me perfectly. I was so pleased that ordered two additional colors.
nb 1080 v3  great price, fits well. very very light weight. a recommended shoe in a great price for its value. strongly recommend
Absolutely love it!  Very light and comfy on the feet. Perfect fit. I have had this pair for two months already and I absolutely it.
nice quality products and fast shipping  nice quality products and fast shipping
New Balance ML574  Just great shoes , as always NB  does and on bonus you have laces white as also light blue as a part of the shoes  Thanks New balance for making great shoes for big feets as mine :)
great all around shoes  This is my second pair of these shoes and I've never purchased the same pair of shoes twice in my life. Use mine for everyday activities like yard work, biking, runningl, etc
Good support for Plantar Fasciitis  Very good shoes.  Good support and helps with my Plantar Fasciitis that I got from wearing a pair of Sketchers GoRun shoes which had no support.  The GoRuns feel much better than these when you first put them on b/c they are soft and light, but there is nothing to them and your feet will pay the price in the long run.  This is a good pair of shoes with a stiff sole and support.  I bought a second pair too.
Comfortable fit runs small
Good shoe, good price. Shopped fast and arrived on time.
Love them!!!  I bought these shoes to run in but after seeing them and wore them one day on a casual trip I changed my mind about making them into running shoes, I love them and they fit comfortably. Will they last forever, will take a while to find out. I am thinking of buying  a pair for my brother's birthday.
Walking on pillows  I am a walker and put on about 15-20 miles a week on my shoes.  My current pair has approx 500 miles on them and are still pretty supportive but I am ready for a new pair.  I was always under the impression that running shoes were only for runneres.  What a mistake I made.  I had my feet fitted at Fleet Feet in Northfield, Ohio and ended up purchasing the above shoe.  I was having slight discomfort in my lower calves at the time which quickly went away after walking with the Sauconys.  The support was fantastic and felt like I was walking on pillows. I never thought I would pay over $100 for a pair of athletic shoes.  Now I understand the phrase "you get what you pay for".  I purchased these shoes at Amazon because they are last years model and not easy to find retail.  The great thing is, since they are last years model the price dropped to $67 a pair.  Quite a savings over the $110 I paid last year.  So if there any walkers out there reading this review, go get yourself fitted with a quality running shoe and hit the internet for some real saving.  I have never walked in a more comfortable shoe.  I keep my old ones around and wear them as slippers around the house.  I never wear my primary walking shoes for casual use so it is nice to have seconds around for that purpose.  Thanks and take care.  Jim
Fit great.  Third pair purchased in last year and a half. Fit great.
Great job!  They are really great! I have tried this for almost 60 Km and so far so good. The felling is amazing. It's not really like running barefoot but quite a nice-similar approach, really awesome minimalist shoes. I have read about blisters and other consequences on first trials but I did't have a single one... well I have already been running for a while so maybe they are not for starters but well recommended.
Best running shoes ever.  These are the best running shoes available. This is my 5th pair. I try on other shoes (even the Boosts) and nothing is close to the Ultra Boost.
Very nice comfortable shoes for the price
Recommended  So far, nicest running shoes I have purchased.
I am happy with my shoes!
The perfect tri shoe  I love my noosa tri 8 running shoes, they fit like a glove, the cushioning is perfect, very light weight, maybe not so good for sock less running...
Haven't run on these ones yet, but expected soon, later i'll give my update.
Great shoe; great support and stability  Only shoe to wear. Great shoe; great support and stability.  Worth the $$$$$$s.
excellent customer service and product
I love "toe shoes"  These are my second pair of Komodo's.  The first pair were the normal KomodoSports that used velcro straps to tighten them.  Let me say: I thought that I loved the original Komodo's, but that was until I tried on the KomodoSport LS.  I much prefer the 'lace' version of these shoes.  Now - you might ask: why would anyone ever buy those.  First of all, I bought them originally to lift weights in.  I used to be the person that would take off his shoes in the gym in order to dead lift or squat, but in all honesty, that's kind of gross.  So I bought these as an alternative.  Since that time, I have also started doing CrossFit and these shoes are great for those workouts as well.  Also, these shoes are extremely comfortable.  I used to have a job where I was on my feet all day and these were actually very comfortable to stand in.  I have also run in these shoes (although never more than 5 miles).  I am not going to say that running in these shoes is better than regular running shoes - but it is different.  Gives a different workout than running, making you use your calves significantly.  All in all, I would recommend these shoes to almost anyone.  However, before purchasing them on Amazon, go to a running shop and try them on.  You need to be able to get a pair that fits properly, and to do that you need to be able to try them on.  Also, you can try on the different models of shoe if you are in a store.
Great shoes!!!!
good shoe
Comfortable fit, perfect for my flat feet  Loving these shoes, especially for the price that I paid. I am flat-footed and have trouble jogging/running with most running shoes. These fit perfectly and have just the right amount of cushioning. They also help me with my over-pronation issues. I have owned more expensive shoes and these are just as good as the pricier ones that I have owned in the past. I would definitely buy these again
These are very comfortable.
Perfect for running.
Best Pair of shoes I've ever owned. They were great for my Planter Fasciatis
Awesome Shows!
The ONLY brand of sneaker I buy that meets all my needs.
Great shoes. Super comfortable  Great shoes. Super comfortable. Fit as expected
Excellent purchase !
they don't have much cushion so we had to get some big and tall gel inserts but other than that they are great, plan on getting a  husband loves these shoes for work. they don't have much cushion so we had to get some big and tall gel inserts but other than that they are great, plan on getting another pair.
trail running  one of the best fit and cushioned shoe I have ever purchased cant wait to find other colors to acquire
great shoe for lifting
Dope ass kicks  These kicks are dope af! Totally comfortable I'll be buying another pair soon .
Great trail runner  First of all, let me get the "caveat" out of the way.  If you are looking for a "hybrid" running shoe, which is to say, one  that you can run on trails as well as pavement, this is NOT it.  This shoe is exactly what it is advertised...a trail runner.  Period.  Walking or running on pavement feels very strange.  The best way I can put it, is that it feels like a wire-bristle doghair brush strapped to each foot, and walking bristle-side-down on them.  Where this shoe belongs is in the dirt, mud, rocks, grass, and gravel.  And once in any of those places, it is fantastic!  The tread grips the off road surfaces like a... well, just like a puma's claw.  You can clearly tell that the shoe's designers did their homework with the tread, and didn't just randomly throw on a bunch of lugs and deep grooves with no rhyme or reason.  The traction on ascents, descents, sharp curves, over obstacles, through wet and dry conditions, is beyond impressive, in my opinion.  It is very well-cushioned and gives a soft ride.  While not exactly in the Hoka OneOne category, it is definitely not a barefoot shoe either.  But it not a heavy shoe.  You can go all day in this, and not feel like you're wearing combat boots.  As far as stability and motion-control, the best I can describe is that it feels like a lot of Brooks Adrenalines that I've worn in the past.  It is built as well, or better than, anything by any premium running shoe company out there.  In short, I love this shoe.  It has totally reenergized and revitalized my trail-running.  I am kind of sad that I had to buy this shoe through Amazon.  But only because I checked the official Puma website first, and they do not offer it there anymore, which leads me to believe that they don't make it anymore.  That's too bad.  Hopefully they bring it back or replace it with something just as good.
Good shoe  Fits good very comfortable.
These shoes were a BD present for my son. He loves them! He loves just about all nike shoes and always wears 10.5 but these seem to run a little large.
They so good I'm so happy with my asics
Like the way they feel
Terrific shoe!
Shoes  I bought these for my wife for her Birthday and she loves them. Really comfortable.
Good value  Shoe has all the performance features as the more expensive NB tennis shoes.
Great cross country shoes  I've worn these shoes for two full cross country seasons and they are still going strong.  They fit great, provide support - yet feel light.
100% recomendable.
Love the shoes, quick delivery, and accurate description.
Great Trail running shoes  I am very happy with these trail running shoes.  I was a little concerned buying them online without trying them on first, but they offered free returns so I gave it a shot.  I could not be happier.  These trail shoes look really nice and fit perfectly.  I typically wear Nike and a size 10 so I bought size 10 in these Fila as well and they fit perfectly.  They are a little wider than the nike sneakers tend to run so a bit more comfortable.  They also look really nice and seem quite durable.  I travel to Seattle area for work and these will be perfect for hiking the trails out there.
nice shoes  I usually wear an 11 1/2 shoe.  This was too tight in the toes.  I ordered a 12 and it's good.  Shoe fits well and is comfortable.
My 2nd pair and love them both  More comfy than my Nike airmax, my Jordans and equal to my New Balnaces! Very well made and visually appealing! My 2nd pair and love them both!! Im a 9 in Nike 9 1/2 in onemix perfectly!
Normal nothing crazy  Just like my old ones. Good so far after a few uses
MOST COMFORTABLE RUNNING SHOES!  This is the second pair that I have bought. These are the most comfortable running shoes I have ever used.
Superior shock absorption
My go to shoe.  I've been wearing this shoe for 20 years.  I tried other Asics models but keep coming back
Comfortable  Gift for my nephew, he loves them.
They Look hot, they feel great  I am not an experienced runner. However, these shoes are great. They feel amazing and they look very cool.  Also they are very well built.
Great shoes
Great shoe  As always, Asics fit predictably.  This shoe is a bit heavier than their typical running shoe, but with gel all around and a substantial heel cup, stability and comfort are unsurpassed.
The size is very standard The error is not very big  Color is just what I need The size is very standard The error is not very big The permeability is very good
I love how the sole feels  I love how the sole feels. Not too bouncy,  not too hard on my foot. I am a 270lb person, when it come to jogging,  this shoe is perfect. I gave it a 4 because for it to feel great. Also I get a lot of complements on the look of the shoe.
great shoe  fits perfect
I really love these shoes  I really love these shoes. They were comfortable right out of the box and give me adequate support. I am not a runner, but like the minimalist shoes. All in all, a great shoe!
...i have very tender feet from years of speed skating on ice and skiing and these shoes are just what the doctor ordered.....
Great barefoot shoe  This is my first barefoot-style shoe. I've worn this shoe during workouts and runs for a little over a month and it has performed exactly as expected. Running was a little bit of an adjustment, aided by my use of NB minimus for running during the past 6 months. So far it feels great and has been durable.  I really like the option of using the included sock-style liner, or replacing that with the tongue-only liner and wearing my own socks. If adjusting to barefoot-style is tough, pick up a spiky massage ball to help your feet. I recommend this shoe and will consider buying more products from Vivobarefoot.  UPDATE Jan 2013: I still like this shoe, but after many months the sole no longer has enough traction for pushing or pulling anything around on the rubber floors at the gym. I stopped wearing it there after some extremely difficult sessions with the prowler sled. It still has ok traction on pavement for running, especially on concrete sidewalks.
It's awesome !!!! 
Great shoe and use them when I lift and have never had an issue with them. They keep my foot secure and shoes does not roll when you things like squats. Before I would only use running shoes to lift and after using these shoes, I understand the importance of proper lifting shoes. I do not do Crossfit because I have too many sports injuries. From feet, lower back, and shoulder. So how they work during a CrossFit workout, I cannot vouch for that. One thing that I might want to point out the shoe does run a little big in the front but a huge amount but slightly wider than most shoes.
Very comfortable
Very comfortable to wear
Didn't hurt at all during break in. No discomfort, very light and supportive.
love merrell barefoot  I use these for training inside the gym. Usually wear a size 8.5, however with merrell barefoot I always order one size smaller.( seem to run large). I cant say enough how there minimalist shoes are awesome for my feet. My legs, calves, feet are way stronger and my stride( running on a trendmill ) much better, stronger and faster then with other shoes I've tried. ( used saucony, asics, brooks..all hurt my feet, created hotspots, feet would get numb just putting them on). The fit was fairly as expected. Somewhat larger fit then my merrell sonics ( not a con ) I have been wearing for months..( toe box has plenty of room, sonics little tighter). I purchased these for indoor training only, however, I used sonics outdoors and really had no issues with leg fatigue, numbness etc. I will be purchasing barefoot trail shoes for outdoor running and training in the future. These are high quality construction, light weight  and do what they are supposed to do. If your looking for minimial shoes, you cant go wrong with merrell.
Simply the best  Most comfortable shoes asics has made so far.  Constantly stopped and complimented on the looks!
Great shoe, fits nice, comfortable, and looks good and cheaper then the outlet price
Great Shoes  I love Nike Air Max 90's. They are true to size, extremely comfortable, and durable. These shoes are the real deal and came brand new.
as advertised
Great for Planters fasciitis  I purchased these shoes after reading several articles about them helping with Planters Fasciitis.  I went to the Podiatrist several times and found no cure.  The five finger shoes did not cure it but after wearing them for a while my feet felt stronger.  I am not the type of person to dismiss medical advice but against my Podiatrist advice I bought them.  The first couple of days my feet hurt but now the feel great.  I would recommend them to everyone.  I wear them all the time.  I have also come to the conclusion that they make your feet stronger.i.e promote muscle growth and strength.
Comfy  My 12 year old says these are the most comfortable shoes he's ever had.
Purchased for my son, excellent shoe!  I was beyond pleased with this shoe, which I purchased for my 6th grader!  It is so hard to find a really good running shoe in mens sizes 7-8 but these were perfect and worth every penny.  They fit as expected and he said they are the most comfortable shoe ever! Highly recommend!
Perfect level of stability, comfortable shoes that also look good  I took an "alternate route" with shoes to save money in the last few months.  To best provide the info that I'd be looking for in a review, I'll give a quick shoe history...  I ran my first marathon in some stability New Balance shoes which hurt my left knee really badly and kept me from running for almost a year.  When I finally started running again, I moved to the Gel Kayano 14s, all joint paint went away and I would only get muscle soreness like it should be.  I went from there to the Kayano 15s, then the 16s to run countless half marathons.  I decided I was ready to start training for my 2nd marathon after purchasing the Asics GT-2150s.  I completed my 2nd (Death Valley Borax) and 3rd marathon (LA Marathon) in the Asics 2160s, which I actually purchased twice because I liked them so much. I liked them even better than the Kayanos, but several experts have told me that it's because my stability muscles are getting stronger and that I'm slowly transitioning to quicker shoes with less stability.  I made it a point to train for my last marathon at least one long run per 50 mile week in my Asics NEO 33s.  I ran my 4th (Death Valley Borax) and 5th (LA Marathon) marathons in GT-2170s where I got a PR and finished with a negative split.  A couple months ago, I went to the Saucony Guide 5 since I found it on sale in an outlet for $60.  I ran what I think is just over 100 miles in these and developed an injury in my left ankle because they're shaped in a way that "pushes" the left side of my foot inward.  I finally confirmed this by going back to my 2170s and doing several 5+ mile runs and discovering that it was in fact the shoe that was aggravating this.  I decided to try the lesser stability DS Trainer 19 (which I'm reviewing) and it provides EXACTLY the amount of support that I need, and was very comfortable.  I have a little pressure on my left toe, which seems to tell me that the shoe runs a tiny bit smaller than the 2170s, which is contrary to the comparison on [...].  I'll be running a half marathon soon, as well as a few olympic distance triathlons, so I'll update this review for those races to give an accurate picture.
Awesome shoes!!
everyone notices my son on the mat with these colors  made well. fits as expected. appear well made and very light
As advertized
What can you say? NB did it again.  My dad is a true fan of NB and loves the 990 series. He bought the 990v4 (we caught it on a sale for a low price), Navy Blue. He uses them daily, without a wear.
Great shoes, very durable  Great shoes, very durable. I would buy again
Pronation Support  Comfortable shoe for general use and walking, especially for men with over-pronation problems and flat-feet. Strong and durable shoe. May not be as light compared to other running shoes such as Saucony, etc.
AWESOME! AWSESOME! AWESOME!  Wears good! Feels good! It's all good! I've walked in them with no rubbing or blistering! Comfort in grass, pavement, and on the beach!
Great Product and sturdy  Great Product and sturdy
Great shoes  They fit great and my feet feel great wearing them. Excellent
Best running show on the market  I am a bigger guy that runs a lot. I would always have accompanying joint pain after runs. Not anymore. Since using this product my runs are spectacular and I'm not hurting the next day. Extremely light shoe. The higher sole takes a little getting used to, but after a couple runs, your 2 milers will turn into 4 milers.
Love these  Had to add gen hee cups to give a little more cushion to the heels because the insoles are rather thin.  otherwise I love em!  great control but no pressure points, More comforable than Brooks Beast & more support than The other Asics control shoes.
Awesome
Great  Fit perfect and arrived quickly
Shoes fit very well  Size 11 2E.  Glad I ordered the 2E, most other sneakers didn't have any Extra Wides in size-11. I know it is expensive for a sneaker, but it is very comfortable and fits well.
Perfect work out shoes for him  Nephew loves it. Perfect work out shoes for him.
I love these shoes. They are extremely light weight and comfortable.
Like magic elf slippers.  Wonderful to run in.
Badass
excellent product
very happy with the product  very happy with the product. im a heavier person, and very flat footed, i use these shoes to run 3 to 5 miles 4 to 5 days a week.
GOOD
Stabil CS3 best shoe ever!  I've had stability issues (Plantar) for years. I used to wear the Stabil CS2, switching them out ever 300-450 miles.  The new Stabil CS3 's are lighter, have a better foot print.
but I love them. I bought them for running  I've only had these for about a week, but I love them. I bought them for running, but I wore them to work to break them in first (not really necessary I found out as they are so comfortable and soft) and ended up deciding to buy another pair for running and I'll keep wearing these to work. I love these shoes!
Awesome thanks
good. the design is ok,and the color is my favor
Very Impressed!  Just received my Speedcross shoes today and couldn't be happier with them. obviously this is just an initial review but here is what i think of them.  Quality is outstanding, probably the most comfortable shoes i have ever put on, extremely grippy, quick lace system is very convenient and stays tight. could not be more impressed with these shoes.
So far so good!  Great shoe out of the box. Plan to use these for a Ragnar run!!
Perfect!  Great shoe!
ok
comfortable
The shoe is great and feels comfortable. It's lite also and I just love it!
Fits great!
Best Exercise Shoe  I have finally found the perfect shoe for my daily workouts. No more leg or ankle pains since switching to this running shoe. This is the second pair I have ordered and will stay with it in the future.
Excellent!  The best version of the 608 since the original.  Even with a wide foot (4E) and new socks,these sneakers fit very comfortably.
Nice shoes
Love the shoes one of my better pair of ASICS
Good year shoe  great shoe for about a years worth of work hauling wood, concrete and sheet rock on solid pavement, performed excellent.
Fit well Look great Non slip  Fit well Look great Non slip tread
Altra Forever  After doing a proper amount of research I learned that you need to order a half size larger than your normal running shoes. Other than that these shoes are amazing. I have ran in Inov-8's, Vibram Five Fingers, Brooks and Montrails and these are by far the best trail running shoes I have ever had. The extra large toe box and zero drop is something I have missed since doing barefoot running. All issues and soreness I have had with uncomfortable feet after running, scrunched up toes, and hot sports are completely gone. I am an Altra runner from now on.
nice shoe
Zero lift perfection  Love these shoes for high intensity workouts. Perfect for Insanity, Tabata, P90X and Body Combat. Totally flexible soles and zero lift (flat all the way across). Gotta order by Euro size though - US size is slightly larger than given.
Fits just fine!
In these shoes he can stay on his feet comfortably for long periods of time  My husband has hip and ankle issues. In these shoes he can stay on his feet comfortably for long periods of time. This is the second pair he's owned.
These shoes work wonderfully!!  First of all, I can't believe how light weight these shoes are!  They fit great and as I ordered a wide size, they accommodate my arch support wonderfully.  I also love the look of them.
It's a slick looking very comfortable shoe. I am not a long distance runner  This is an aesthetic improvement from my last pair of Adidas Duramos. It's a slick looking very comfortable shoe. I am not a long distance runner, but it works great as a casual sneaker
Great running shoe  Have used the Kayano for years, was a little reluctant to go to the 22 as I'd heard the toe box was smaller.  It did seem tighter when I first put it on but broke in very quickly and fits great now.  I compared it to a version of the 21 and actually feel like this one gives me more arch support, which is great for me.  If you've had good luck with the Kayano in the past I'd recommend this version without any reservations.  I've probably put on about 30 miles so far and have had no issues at all, very happy with it.
A wonderful street shoe  As a fan of the New Balance Minimus series shoes, I was delighted to find this street- (and casual work-)friendly shoe. I have worn a pair pretty much every day for about six Months, inside the shoe it shows (the fabric is getting a little torn, and the inside of the sole is starting to fall apart), the outside (including the sole) is still looking and feeling great.  The first few outings of this shoe it pays to be a little extra careful as they tend to be slightly slippery on wet surfaces until the outer sole has been worn in, once you have used them a couple of times this is no longer an issue.  The shoe looks brilliant in both the "Tan" and the "Brown" versions.
Nurse approved  These are just another awesome pair of shoes that can make a 12 hour shift not as painful on the feet...
Asics Gel nimbus are the most comfortably shoes that I have ever bought  Asics Gel nimbus are the most comfortably shoes that I have ever bought.  I have tried all other brands and nothing compares to my Asics.
Another year of shoes making my "500 steps within a days time COMFORTABLE!  Love them!
Comfortable!!!  This is my second pair...I have also the yellow one..
American Ninja Warrior shoes!!  American Ninja Warrior shoes!!
Great shoes, good price  I use those shoes almost everyday for 10 hours a day and they are lightwaight, cofertable, and strong. Great shoes!
I love the Fluid Feels  I love the Fluid Feels. They are the perfect blend ofor trail running and some back road or even highway use.  They feel great everytime!
Fix excellent.  It did meet my expectations. Fix excellent.
A practical review for those who want these shoes as your daily shoes!  I have owned 5 pairs of Salomon's and hands down, they are my favorite brand of shoe and these Speedcross 3s, will surley not dissappoint.  When I was 16-23 years old, I hiked, trail ran, rock climbed, kayaked, etc etc.  I was practically an REI manaquin, I also weighted 30lbs less and had all my hair.  NOW, I am 35, happily married and father to two beautiful children.  I am a Chick-fil-A franchise owner and am living life to the fullest.  When I saw these Salomons, I was intimidated as I am not a "mudder", hiker, mountain climber...however, I do enjoy camping from time to time.  I was looking for a daily, comfortable, stylish pair of Salomons.  The problem was that all 300+ reviews, with the exception of 1 were bragging about how amazing these shoes are on the trail and in mud.  Only one mentioned the fact that they wear them on a daily basis.  I am here to tell you, I have worn them for a week now (on concrete, carpet and tile) and absolutly love them!  They are comfortable, do not look or feel like you are wearing cleats and are a perfect choice to be your daily, go to pair of shoes.  I climbed Pike's Peak in a pair of Salomons but I predict that the largest hill these will see is the hill in my back yard while kicking the soccer ball with my childeren.  Pull the trigger, buy them and you will NOT regret it.  If you do, heck Amazon will take them back!
Wear them everywhere  I got these shoes for my boyfriend, who now absolutely loves them. He wants to wear them all the time, everywhere he goes. His only complaint is that putting them on the first few times,"is kind of weird". Now, he wants to get a pair of five finger shoes that are appropriate for golfing.
Cant beat the fit, comfort and looks
Awesome shoes!  So comfortable and exactly as described. My first ASICS. I wanted a super comfortable shoe that breathed well. Soft fit but very stable shoe.
Great Shoes, Awesome for Spartan Races
Most comfortable shoe I've ever worn.
Great shoes for heaver person  Great shoes for heaver runners.  They do a good job of asorbing shock. My foot size is size 13.  They are a litttle small in the size 13.  Size 14 is perfect.
Love them bought them once already and will continue to buy them. By far the best shoe of my life
Works perfect...
Asics are great shoes for free running parkour, according to my son. He loves them.
Perfect  Arrived when expected, product as described, great fit.
Awesome
great  shoe!!! no more toes falling asleep long distance or on elliptical. I get compliments all the time and they glow in the dark!!
A Comfortable Shoe  Comfortable shoe, fits as expected, and appears well made.
AWESOME!!!
Nice looking well fitting shoe.  This is a great looking shoe.  My son loves it . He wears it to walk and for use when not at work.  Good support and wide enough to not pinch toes.  Quality is good.
My second pair of Wave Rider 18s.  I put too much weight on the outside of my foot when I run, these give me the support and cushion that I need.
Great shoe!
My Wandering Days are Over  When it came time to replace my worn-out Wave Inspire 7's, I got curious about another company that had my "Adrenaline" all pumped up by their fancy technology for absorbing shock.  I thought they'd provide better cushioning, but in the middle of a half marathon when knee pain kicked in, I wasn't "running happy", and finally admitted what the blisters and dead cat bounce cushioning had been telling me all along: it was time to try the Wave Inspire 8's.  Wow! and Awesome! are understatements.  This is the most comfortable shoe I've ever worn for my size 13, somewhat narrow and mildly overpronating feet.  Mizuno got everything dialed in perfectly on this model.  I'm battling the urge to stockpile a bunch so I can have a great shoe to run in for the next ten years.  The 8's have a slightly reduced upper around the ankle (nice, because the 7's initially rubbed my ankle bone), a slightly more roomy toe box, and better forefoot cushoining than the 7's.  I did a 20 mile run last week, had no pain anywhere, and the blisters are gone.  The guy at the running store told me once people run in Mizuno's, they don't go back to other brands.  I certainly learned my lesson!  Couldn't recommend them more.
Just the right shoe  Purchased for my 13 year old son. They were just what he wanted. Go Shox!
Good shoe
Good price great shoes  Love  these running shoes. This is my third pair. Provides just the right amount of protection with none of the restrictive stiffness of some shoes.
Great Purchase from Amazon  The shoes were a replacement for my college age son, who loves this New Balance brand.  I had them sent directly to him at college.  He was very pleased with the speedy delivery and the quality of the updated product.  To his surprise, it fits better and is even more comfortable than his old pair.
Snug but comfortable.  I only wear them when running so I cannot attest to their all day comfort. Snug but comfortable.
Nice shoes  Nice shoes so far
nice
Great shoes  Fits perfectly and will buy more
Best shoes that I own ever  I have flat feet and suffer from pronation. I needed stability shoes for regular everyday use. For last 8 months I have been using New Balance MR1224. I am very impressed with these shoes. These shoes are very comfortable and made from high quality materials.  I will highly recommend these shoes to anybody. If you really want comfortable shoes, go for these shoes, you will not regret.
Nice shoes, Mizumo is my favorite trade mark...
Great shoe, love the Mfg  Great shoe , love the Mfg. beautiful colors .
So nice  Fit like a dream, actually wore them to bed they were so nice. All the people at work were so jelly.
An anti-roll anti-pronation feature and the cushioned comfort of this shoe make it a rebuy for me!!!
Great  Comfortable and looks just as good! Love them!
Great show! Fast shipping!
My 12 y.o. son loves these shoes. This is his 4th pair. Light weight.
Excellent fit!
Very comfortable, this is my 3rd pair! Hope they stay in stock
Perfect for me  My 8th pair of this shoe brand. I've worn the rest out. Perfect for me.
Great running shoe  My old pair of Asics had plenty of miles on them. I had began to have foot pain, so figured it was time for a new pair. These shoes are light and provide the stability that I need for long distance runs. I also have had no foot pain since wearing these. I will definitely buy another pair of Asics once I loaded these up with some miles.
Great shoe, very comfortable with good cushion.
This shoe fits very good and is very comfortable.
Great shoe in every way  This is my fourth pair of Salomon Shoes Speed Cross. And, my first S.C.4. Compared to the S.C3 I can tell it has more support on the heel, so it won't eat the sole as fast as the 3 for those who like me, tend to fall hard on the heel. They also are lighter and a little lower to the ankle. They fit as great as the S.C.3 so I can tell the people who has any doubt that this has the same fit. Salomon fit like a glove and is definitely the most comfortable shoe I've ever owned.
Another great show by asics  Firmer in the soles than the V22s
Love this shoe  Love this shoe. It fits beautifully and is comfortable. I wear my sneakers all day for work and they provide the support I need. Very happy with this purchase.
Excelente.
Favorite Sneaker of All Time  If you need to get new tennis shoes I can not recommend this pair enough. They are my favorite sneaker of all time. I'm seriously debating if I should get another 'back up' pair in case Nike stops making them down the road so I will have another pair when I wear these out. I got them bc I have to start wearing some custom orthotics daily due to collapsed arches and  I liked these b/c you can 'dress' them up a little bit for sneakers. But they are so light, breathable and like walking on a very supportive cloud if that makes sense. The mesh is flexible so it will accommodate bunions too if you have them (they stretch out for my orthotics nicely). I show up for happy hours in them and ppl say outfits are 'cute' so they really do the dress up role nicely.  I'm so happy with them. I got a men's size - I'm a 9 in women's and  ordered an 8 men's and they fit perfect.
My 3rd pair Great shoe
Good buy  Very durable dope shoes, great old school feel and comfort. can use to play sports or casual wear.
This shoe is the most comfortable shoe I've ever run in  This shoe is the most comfortable shoe I've ever run in!  The wide toe box is perfect for me.  Also run with the Hoka One One Clayton but prefer the Infinite for it's comfort.
Great buy
The Best Trail Shoes Ever  These are great fitting trail running shoes.  I was a little nervous with the model changing from XT Wings 2's to XT Wings 3 with modifications in the sole and fabric but they are just as great as the 2's.  If you love running on the tralls, you will love these shoes.
outstanding  My third pair of Altras.  The most comfortable shoe ever.  I don't use them to run in, but I wear them for just about everything else.  They are a much wider than normal shoe, which is why I like them so much.
His feet feel great while running now and he wants ANOTHER pair  My husband can't stop raving about these sneakers!  His feet feel great while running now and he wants ANOTHER pair!
Lovely shoe
Still breaking them in but so far so good
Doctor recommended this shoe for my feet being. Amazing!
excelente!!!
Best shoe ever!  Saw these guys and just had to have them. Did I make the right move?  YOU BET! Very eye catching and comfortable, almost like a slipper.
just get them  Perfect fit. Great classic look!
Fantastic Runner  I was sad to hang these bad boys up. Fantastic fitting shoe, like a sock! Put at least 300 miles on them and still use them for mucking about. Five races including two 1/2's in them and they never let me down. "true to fit", required minimal "breaking in". Would easily purchase again. great product!
CALIDAD TOTAL  Es un tennis que se adapta muy bien al pie. Ademas de confortable y flexible, permite un manejo ideal en terrenos dificiles y en ciudad. Combina con ropa de color similar. Hasta el momento me gustan. PURA VIDA........
AWESOME SHOES!  So far I love them!
love them
Love it !
Another Good Pair of Shoes from NB  Comfortable.shoes.  I still need to insert my arch supports; but once they are in, I'm good to go.  Nice price too!
Incredibly comfortable!  While I had to get a full larger US size than normal, these have to now be the most comfortable sneakers I have ever had. Just sizing was difficult, La Sportiva in general run small and narrow. I have recent nerve damage in my feet, it took me trying dozens of brands of shoes at many places, but when I found these, the padding, is amazing. I got the Black/Yellow, and they also have to be the best looking running shoe I have ever had. They look like their speeding by, just sitting on your feet. I have to emphasize how comfortable the sole is, and great grip.
Great running shoes  Great running shoes. worked out on the treadmill today and had no foot pain like my last pair of shoes.
nice  this product is nice, it fit very well, it was what i expected and they send it when they hsve too.
Perfect  Excellent product.
good support.  Light weight, good support... For $30 can't go wrong
Great Running Shoe  This Saucony running shoe is great, lots of room for my toes and comfortable to run in, i will be running in them for my half marathon later this month ..January 2013.
These shoes are super comfy
Saucony is for runners.  I run about 150 miles a month and Saucony is far and away the best brand for running. As an avid Adidas customer, it hurts for me to say this, but it's true. I have about 20 pairs of Adidas, but when it comes to running the Kinvara 3s cannot be beat. EXTREMELY light weight, but they have the best support. I have really FLAT FEET and I have zero knee and achilles pain with Saucony.
This is second pair ordered I will buy again
Very good
Good shoe  This product is the appropriate size, as ordered.  It's a comfortable fit with some cushioning under the heel.  The base feels somewhat narrow, which slightly decreases its side-to-side stability, but that's a negligible complaint.  Overall, I think it's a good shoe.
Excellent.
solid show  cheap and a good shoe.  i run about 25-30 miles a week and these do fine
Satisfied  No issues. Fit perfectly. Pics did the shoe justice. I'm happy with the purchase.
Awesome  These shoes are ridiculous comfortable. These shoes are worth every penny. I would recommend for any one. The grip is amazing. Thanks new balance for making awesome shoes.
good sneakers
Comfortable!  Really liking these mizunos. This is my second pair, and I really like the way they fit and wear. They seem to be quite durable based on how long my last pair held out.
Husband loves them  It is a great shoe and my husband has used this style many times before.  We thought they were a good price too.
Perfect
My son says they are awesome!
The most comfortable shoe I have ever owned.
I overpronate when I run, so I need stabilizing shoes. I also have wide feet so I bought the 2E and it fits perfectly. Bought 3 pairs so I have extra just in case this gets discontinued in the future
excellent  Nice to the fit ,very comfortable,fits like a glove ,very lightweight. The price in general is quite excellent i think the purchase of this shoes was a great choice.
Best Running Shoe I have Found  I love this running shoe.  Too bad ASICS is discontinuing it.  We'll see if the GT-2000 is a worthy replacement...
Love it, perfect
My dad loves them and says he can no longere find them in stores where we live!!
Great for wide feet  I love Birkenstocks - I now have four pairs.  I have wide feet and a bunion and these use are the best for me
The orange color is very good looking in my opinion  I bought it for my husband and he has been wearing it for a week, no complaints. He does 2-3 miles run every other evening. He said it fits well, he had an old pair of gel-nimbus and that was too loose. The orange color is very good looking in my opinion, not over the top colorful.
Clean  Omg the colorway on this one is simple but clean, so comfortable and stylish
Very nice shoe for the price  Very nice shoe for the price.  Fits a bit 'wide' around the toe, but this is likely because of the stretchy material in this area.  I would buy these again.
Awesome  I use these as hiking shoes...Awesome in every way!
They held up much better than the Gel-Quick-33 which I owned 2 which both fell apart.
ASICS Men's GEL-Strike 2 Running Shoe,White/Navy/Gold,14 D US  Ya gotta love Asics - they are great.
Very happy with purchase thank you
Nice and cool!  I love this shirt! I have never worn something that has kept me so cool while playing tennis when it's 90 degrees outside! The material is delicate, so I wash this with my other delicate laundry and have hung it on the drying rack instead of putting it in the dryer. I will be scouting out more of these shirts in different colors.
Comfortable, durable, Looks Great.  I would go with a 1/2 size smaller. I wear 7.5 but had to return and go down a 1/2. I think the site might have too much cushion but maybe others like that. I think It's not a light shoe, I use it to walk in and hike. I prefer a lighter shoe to run. I gave a 5 because they work for me great. Best looking shoe 100%.
There's always the question of what is the best shoe for the warped wall and other obstacles  I'm an American Ninja Warrior and compete in the National Ninja Leauge. There's always the question of what is the best shoe for the warped wall and other obstacles. This in my opinion is a very sticky shoe and grips the walls in all the gyms I train at. It's super lightweight and you can make accurate transitions with speed in this shoe. I own the V1 Zantes, as well as the Zante V2's bc they're my favorites for indoor and outdoor training. I wear size 9 and 9.5 with different sneakers brands. The 9's were a tad bit small and the 9.5's fit me perfect.
My feet are happy again  Great replacement for my old ones. Comfort Shoe Specialists screwed up my custom inserts and am out hundreds of dollars with nothing to show for it. Bought a replacement set of Birkenstocks and my feet are happy again! Great buy. Great price. I think I will buy another pair to keep in my dress shoes and divvy up the duty.
fathers day gift for my husband  He was looking for a pair os shoes just like the one he left, i gave him as a fathers day gift and he loved them. They are so comfortable for him.
Very flashy color!  I have wanted a pair of Salomon's for awhile, but due to the cost I couldn't justify at the time. These shoes were at a killer price and I could not pass them up. The aggressive tread pattern on the bottom leads to some great "off-road" running and just all around comfort for everyday use as well. HIGHLY recommend if you want a bright shoe that very few people actually have or wear in public.
LOVE THESE SHOES  I am so overly impressed with these shoes.  Couldn't believe how great they feel running on the trail around town lake.
Great fit and feel
Good Shoes  I have purchased many pairs of these.  They're always good, light, and durable.  I highly recommend them.
perfect
subtle change from 1st issue 14 release  When the first 14 came out , i got it . I have used Nimbus for years and always happy to buy them. The first 14 had a design flaw in the low heel. This caused shifting in the heel liner which made me dislike the shoe after all these years. This 14 ( at least the yellow version) has the higher heel and fits much better. I will buy these again whereas I wouldn't have after owning the blue 1st generation 14's
Blue and beautiful  These are nice and colorful shoes.
5 STARS  GREAT SHOES! VERY PLEASED!
He loved the shoes but I got him the wrong size  I bought these for my father who has an orange hat that he wears all the time so we can see him. He loved the shoes but I got him the wrong size, so I returned them and I got a new pair with in the week. I don't believe he has warn them yet but I know he liked them.
Extremely light and very comfortable. All day shoe.
Good Shoe Doe  Best shoe I have ever had
Amazon is my favorite place to shop  fit as expected and delivered on Christmas Eve. Amazon is my favorite place to shop!
nice shoes
good
Comfortable. I walk/run 10miles a day and these are a great shoe.
Love, love  Love, love, love these shoes! As with any Newton shoe I buy, I purchase a half size larger than I typically wear (I wear men's 11's US normally and order 11.5 Newtons), and I've never had any issues. Highly recommended trail shoes!
... run a bit small but other than that a great shoe.  These shoes run a bit small but other than that a great shoe.
My picky son loves this show.  Good looking shoe.
Best. Sneakers. Ever.  These are the debatably the best and most comfortable shoes that I've ever worn. As a long time NB customer, you won't be disappointed in these - and they live up to the quality that I've come to expect from the company. Much lighter than other trail shoes. I purchased these with the intent of having them be my go-to daily wear shoe. Once these wear out, I will gladly buy the exact same pair, again and again.
Wonderful trail and cold-weather/slushy shoe  If you like your summer-weight ASICs but need something with 1. more tread, 2. less mesh to soak up splashes then these are great shoes.  I have mostly used these shoes for when there's still some slush on the ground from the snow, but they appear to do fine in rock and shallow mud, too.
very satisfied at this price  Always run with brooks shoes,very satisfied at this price.
excellent price and delivery
Love it!
Inspired to Keep Running  I have run in the Inspire 9, 10, and now 11. I have used them for runs of varying lengths all the way up to marathons. I have bunions on both feet and overpronate. I have had a lot of difficulty finding shoes that work well for me, and I have tried several other brands and models. Consistently, the Wave Inspires have been the most comfortable on my feet, and also the shoes that result in the least foot, knee, and hip pain. I especially like the fact that there are no overlays in the bunion area, and the toe box is wide and deep. To provide additional protection on long runs, I also use a New Balance sports cushioning insole in the Inspires. This combination works very well for me.
Great shoes!
Excellent lightweight shoe  Replaced my old pair with these new models. Excellent lightweight shoe.
Love get so many compliments
Superior quality trail runners  Excellent shoes.  I got the red ones and liked them so much I ordered a second pair.  They are comfortable and fit as expected.  the laces stay tied and I think these MT410V4 shoes will last a long time.
Great fit, comfortable run
The best  Perfect
I like the shoes
Asics Gel-Kayano 21 upgrade from Cumulus 15  Bought these for my son.  He likes the color.  It is not quite as bright blue as the picture indicates.  He is moving from the Cumulus 15 to this shoe.  He can tell it has more arch support and still has the nice cushion.  Main use is working and walking on hard surfaces.  They are also very light weight.  He has worn Nike in the past and these are much better in our opinion.
Good Quality Shoes!  I have been buying Saucony shoes for the last year or so and I haven't had any complaints. Good comfortable quality shoes that I can always find my size in.
Asics always good!  I like 'em. Good shoes. Black on Black.
Good running shoes.
Good shoe for walking, has a little more arch than what I need due to flat feet
Great Shoe  I was never a fan of the barefoot idea until I did my research. I tried this type and not the five toe shoe one because, I really don't like having my toes touched to begin with, and the idea of a shoe sperating my toes was not inviting and the thought was uncomfortable. I am active duty and the Army just banned the wear of the five toe shoes while wearing an Army PT uniform. With this shoe I can still wear it with a pair of thin socks without discomfort. I did go with a .5 size larger going from a 10 to 10 1/2 just to have room for a thin pair of socks. The shoe feels awesome on the treadmill and on pavement, I ran 2 miles my first try and my calf's weren't killing me the next day. It has plenty of room for your toes to stretch and the rest of the shoe fits nice and snogged. Walking over gravel feels the way it would barefoot, you can feel every rock, but when you run on hard floor, amazingly my feet feel "NO" discomfort, and this is coming from a guy with 12 years active duty, bad knee's, bad ankles, and a bad back, and I LOVE these shoes!
excellent item
Good Fit  Exactly what I was looking for, light, and fit well.
Great fit (for wide feet). And excellent cushioning.  I have a wide foot (4E) and these Asics running shoes fit perfectly and provide excellent cushioning on my daily run.
these shoes are awesome. they feel like you're walking on clouds and they fit perfectly
Love these for running!  5th pair of these. You can get about 500 miles before the rubber wears all the way down.
Great shoe. Lasts a year wearing every day.
Very comfortable!!!
Gil Zero  Great shoe. I've bought five pairs of  GZ's since they debuted and  loved them all. I was surprised  to se my size still available on Amazon and ordered them immediately .i still have people  asking where I got them and how to order them.
Great shoes
Great shoe! Classic style  Love everything about these. Good quality! Only downside is I am a very hard user on shoes and need to replace frequently. These do a good job of keeping up with me and my needs, soles usually last me up to 9 months which compared to other shoes is about 6 months longer! Well done!
Most Comfortable Shoes  These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. I like the wide toe box and the level of cushion for everyday wear. They feel like you are wearing slippers.  I actually don't use the Altra Provision 1.5 to run because I like a little more cushion (higher stack height) for running. I do wear the Provision 1.5 for everything else from going to the gym, using cardio machines, long power walks and just wearing them casually. Actually, they are so comfortable I wear them daily and don't like taking them off.  I've have suffered from plantar fasciitis, arch pain and shin splints in the past but I don't experience that with these shoes.  I liked these so much, I purchased the Altra Torin 1.5 for road running and the Altra Lone Peak 2.0 for trail running. It took a while to ease into them and I run differently (not heal to toe anymore), but now I am able to run more frequently than I have for over 10 years and pain free.  The only criticism I have is sizing. The Altra shoes seem to vary between different models. Some models seem to run smaller. I've heard this has been corrected in the newer models which agrees with my experience. I normally wear a men's 9.0 and here is what I found:  - Provision 1.5 seems to run small.  I had to return the 9.0 because they were to short.  My toes hit the front of the shoe.  I ordered a 9.5 and they fit great. -Altra Torin 1.5 fit true to size.  A 9.0 fit perfect. -Altra Lone Peak 2.0 fit true to size. A 9.0 fit perfect.  I would recommend them to a friend.
Nice shoes, wearing just a good! Walking is very comfortable
The weight and fit of the shoe is great, Lightweight and comfortable.
Great running shoes. Good grip, nice colors, very breathable, pretty right. Great for running or in general.
Great Looking Shoes  I bought these for my 10 year old son for his birthday and he absolutely loves them.  Says they are very comfortable (he is very athletic so comfort is key).
Excellent!!!
Used as a walking shoe and with a change in insole there great
Great shoes very comfortable
Perfects!!
Very light, comfortable to wear  Sneakers is the husband. He is delighted. Constantly takes sneakers exactly Salomon. Very light, comfortable to wear, pleasant and beautiful.
Love them. very durable as well.
My son loves these. Kept his feet dry in the rain.
Reebok men's Pheehan Running Shoe  The fit is great and a they are a very nice looking shoe.  I am very happy with the purchase.
Very Satisfied
good
So comfortable!  I love these shoes. It's been a long time since I've had a pair of shoes that were this comfortable.
love these  love these
love it
Most comfortable pair of running shoes I own!
Great shoes, great price  At an amazing price, I purchased the shoes I have always wanted and they are perfect.  Thankyou!
Merrell Men's Mix Master  These shoes fit great. They are a perfect fit, everything I expected and more. Would Highly recommend these to anyone.
Runs about a half size small  Only been a few days of using them but the shoe seems great. I gotta agree with some other reviewers, this shoe DOES run about a half size small. I think my feet are 9's, I typically get a 9.5 because when I was growing up my mom would always tell me that I needed room to grow in my shoes... well, that mentality continues in my own head to this day. haha Point is, my feet are 9's, I wear 9.5, I bought a 9.5 and it fits like a 9. So, buy a half size larger than you normally would.
very good training shoe~  Perfact
Sick Nasty  These shoes are sick nasty. Insane traction & grip on the incline, and allows you to shred down any decline. Burns through tred pretty fast though.
Excellent
Hubby loves these!
Highly Recommended  Good fit and more comfortable than other performance hikers that I own.
Nice kicks!!
Good quality, love asics!! Good price.
Excellent shoes  I was nervous buying running shoes online, but these did not disappoint in the least.  I've had no foot or shin pain while wearing these.
Amazing thick sole with a great lightweight and flexible feel!
Great Comfortable Running Shoe  I have a little wider foot and have used ASICS running shoes since the days I ran long distances. Now I am older but still do a lot of walking and the shoes continue to be very comfortable. A few months ago, I had a knee replacement and decided to replace my old ASICS with new ones. Once again, I was very happy with the fit and comfort of the shoe, definitely my most comfortable shoe.
Very good
Great grip, these shoes rock!  I wore these on my first tough mudder, and when my friends were slipping and sliding in the mud i didn't slip once, these really hold the ground under your feet, they are almost like cleats. they are very comfortable and didn't hurt my feet at all during the 11 mile course. i was very impressed with the shoes, so were my friends.
like the detail on the sole  Quality shoe, like the detail on the sole.
Love these shoes. There comfortable and I have received many compliments on there style.
Excellent  Excellent
Saucony Unleash throwing shoe  My son is a high school senior who has been throwing discus for several years. He loves these shoes. Very comfortable & great on the rotation!
Good shoes  I did not know this brand but I chose to try it and I am very happy with the product.
It met our expectations as all New Balance shoes have.
I'm exceptional pleased with this product  I'm exceptional pleased with this product. Fit and finish are excellent and the sole and heel of this shoe is both lightweight and extremely supportive. These shoes are replacing a pair of New Balance shoes which were comparable in price. The New Balance shoes were never comfortable for me as I felt as if I had no sole support. It felt like walking barefooted. I go to the gym regularly and spend much of my time doing aerobic machinery. These shoes work very well in that regard, as I do treadmill and other running in place type activity. A strong recommendation. Rick Brown
Merrells are the best  Love Merrells.  Very comfortable, solid and sturdy, great traction.
Great all around active shoes  Really like these, I'm not much of a runner but for general cardio or just wearing out or around the house they're great. I've got a couple of pairs and all of them have held up really well.
Excellent Asics Product  After use a lot of brands of running shoes i buy this one and i can say that is the best shoe to run, 5 stars, buy it..... is the best
My husband love them !
these are amazing for track running  super durable and very stylish, these shoes are light as air and tough as nails. the addition of removable spikes is very nice.
A wide pair shoes that fit  4E size fit very well, one of the things improved on this model the tongue was a little longer and thicker than previous models. Will be buying another pair in the future. Wish they had more colors to chose from. Thank you Ezzpar
I did order a half size up as recommended by previous reviewers and it was perfect. Excellent shoes!!
Amazing!  March 9th, 2016...All I wear is Asics. I can kill a pair of Nikes in a month running and a pair of NB in 2. So, Ive be3n buying $150 pair's that were awsome. Some how these are even better, I'll let you know in a couple months. Didn't think it was possible.  Update! May 16th, 2016... These shoes are amazing. Incredible comfort. And look nearly brand new! 2 1/2 months later!  Being black in color I'm sure helps. But they are holding up awsome! And I run my a$$ off!  These will be purchased again. Might buy a second pair now before they go away.  Let me know what you think! Mark.
I ordered another pair I liked them so much
Nice  Thank you for your time I love the shoes, and hope to continue working with you in the near future.
Buy them  Of course you could buy other running shoes , but as far as running with plantar fasiitis goes these are the best . Not foot or leg pain after a good run at all . These are my best friend when it comes to running .
love"em  I substitute better insole and carbon plate for less foot stress.
Awesome.
Excellent!
Grandson  Grandson loved them!
Great shoe!  Great support for my high arches. Excellent cushion for walking, jogging and running. Light weight & well-made. Would highly recommend.
Great!!!  Great quality my boys are rough on shoes so this is perfect
Good product for sprint spikes!  great fit, fast to put on and tighten! super light and felt great wearing them in my race! a good investment.
Great, comfortable and affordable sneakers!  Great, comfortable and affordable sneakers!
the best ever  I have a pair of these sneakers already they are my favorite most of the time i run on treadmill but sometimes on track these sneakers are very lite an super comfortable!!!
Super Shoe  The most comfortable running shoe I've found. Super light and extremely comfortable. The strange looking rubber gizmos on the sole delivered quite a surprise in terms of comfort and resiliency, they really dampen impacts well. The shoe seems to mold to your foot providing superb support without any discomfort. Very high quality construction and attention to detail. Pricey, but worth it.
Cool!  Husband love them!! Wears them hiking and hunting. Gore-tex fits a little tighter and doesn't have as much flexibility to the shoe. Hopefully they will loosen a little as he breaks them in.
Great Shoes for OCRs  I used these shoes for the Rugged Maniac Mud Run, here in Charleston. I have a wide foot but they still worked well. The lugs on the shoe gripped when I needed them to. They expelled water very well. I paired this with the Mud Gear compression socks and loved the combination. I would prepare for a break in period though.
Shoes  I was looking for best price on New Balance MR993 Running Shoes and I was able to find it through Amazon. Com.  My order was delivered on time and was exactly what I was expecting.  If you know what brand and model you want, this method of purchasing works well and I would recommend it.
comfortable  very comfortable, almost like only having soles on your feet ! i like the style and look of the shoes.
Sporty looking, comfortable all day, size-up  I really like how these shoes look and feel on. They are very comfortable and I can wear them for long hours and my feet still feel good in them.  I also like how breathable they are and that my feet don't get hot and stinky in them. I normally wear a size 11 in shoes but size 11's in these were too small on me and size 12's fit just right so I'd recommend going at least a half size up on them or even a full size up if you are someone who is between sizes sometimes. The width is good though, not too narrow and restrictive and not loose either.  I've worn them for work, running, and working out and had good traction and haven't had any slip issues.
Brooks are the best shoes ever produced. Someone alert Nike.
New Balance need I say more?  I fell in love with New Balance shoes about 6 years ago. Always a great fit. Always a quality product. Living in small towns means I can never find a pair of size 14 shoes to try on. I have to resort to buying online. With New Balance, I've never had to make a return! Not to mention I can find them on Amazon.com for less than I can anywhere else.
The perfect walking shoes  Very comfortable
They work and feel great
Great Shoe Fit Perfect And Looks Just Like The Real Pair,The Only Problem Is The Words In The Shoe Come OFF EASILY!!!!!! BE AWARE BUYERS
Nomad TR  Great shoe and great price. These shoes are perfect for shorter trail runs and I have worn these to work a few time and they kept my feet comfortable. Would def recommend!
Love them! 2nd pair now
good value  Very comfortable like walking on air!
Just like my first-gen Gel-Exalts  Replacements (eventually, using both at the same time now) for my Gel-Exalt 1s. Just like the older verrsion, plug and play.
Very good and very comfortable. I will take it for 2015 BJ Marathon.
YES!  Love these colors
All is good
great deal for a triathlon shoe  Great shoe, trippy colors best price around
Longtime Favorite  This is the 6th pair of Nike Men's Lunarglide shoes that I have purchased. They always fit perfectly and suit my running style well.
Love these  This are my favorite workout shoes of all time. I have two pair because they are great at all times. If I could sleep/shower in them I would.
... for work and I can say they are very comfortable and offer a lot of cushion  I bought these shoes for work and I can say they are very comfortable and offer a lot of cushion. I like the sole as much as my lunarlon nikes
A Good Racing Shoe  My son runs high school cross country.  He uses orthotics in his everyday trainers with success.  He has been unable to use racing flats/spikes without problems since coming back from an injury last year- not enough support.  These shoes allow him to use his inserts.  They are nice and lightweight and seem to be working well as his racing shoe.  Very pleased!
I have a flat foot, which is very comfortable
Great shoes  I got the 14s. They are great if you need width in the ball of your foot and arch support. One con with these shoes is that your heel might kinda slide off the sole due to the flyknit flexibility.
Very comfortable shoe.  I buy it over and over.....every year or so.
Best sneaker I've ever owned  Best sneaker I've ever owned! I bought it because I'm a bigger guy and have stability issues, and these are by the most comfortable shoes I've ever bought.
Bought them as a replacement of a pair of the exact same model and size. Great shoe for my feet and ankles.
Awesome!
Runners watch  My granddaughter is a "Cross Country Runner" her comment is "I can check my times without breaking my arm motion. Great help in long runs".
Great looking and comfortable  My last two pairs of running shoes weren't wide. My feet would always stretch out the shoes. These shoes, however, fit perfectly. This was a good purchase.
Very comfortable  It is exactly what it is advertised to be.  a comfortable pair of minimalist shoes.  Well made and wears well.
Nice cushion sole
Very comfortable.
Comfortable  Lasted long and were very comfortable don't go buying expensive these are just as good as others
shoes  I think they are ugly but my husband will love them. He wanted these for Christmas, so I hope these fit
It was exactly what I expected
My new favorite shoes! I'm trying to get most of the color ways.
Great shoe  Haven't quite used it yet, but the reputation of this shoe I'm sure won't disappoint.
Truly light weight  These shoes are very comfortable and light weight, the color is as shown on the website. The delivery was very fast. The product quality is as expected from Adidas.
Still awesome  This is my fifth pair of five fingers in 3 years. I have worn two of them out and keep the others for special wear. I like the KSOs because they are the lightest and most minimal of the bunch. I will but another pair when these wear out.
great!  love them!
Great shoe with soles that should last a while.
I like it!  I wear this as a walking shoes and it is very comfortable. perfect fit as well. overall like it very much :)
Perfect fit.  Shoe fits perfect. Snug fit almost does require lacing. Then again the No Tie lacing system works really well. I need a wider fit and Solomon is the only shoe I can depend on fitting without crushing my toes. The tread grabs everything in any direction, up or down hill. You can wear them on the street but it would probably wear down the tread lugs faster.
Great for the money
Very Nice  Very comfortable and looks nice.  Great price and fast delivery
Like walking on clouds!!  Extremely comfy!
Awesome Shoes  Wow! Are these shoes comfortable.  I jog 4 miles a day five days a week (2 on treadmill and 2 on the road).  I've worn all the big names--Nike, Adidas, Reebok, etc.--and I have honestly never put on a pair of running shoes that were this comfortable.  They feel great even without socks.  I wear 11.5 and these Skechers were true to size for me; but I will add, I have fairly narrow feet and can see why others suggest going up at least a 1/2 size. I usually go through a pair of $120-$150 Nike's every 3-4 months.  Even if these last me 2 months, it's still a deal... and the comfort can't be beat.  I'm going to go ahead and order another pair just to have on hand.  Plus, I got these for a ridiculous deal on Prime Day.  If you're thinking about buying a pair of these, stop thinking and do it.  P.S.  These are great shoes for walking around... not just gym shoes.
Excellent Running Shoes!  These shoes are great for running! I usually buy a cheap pair of running shoes but decided to splurge a little on this pair, and it was well worth it! I did not know what I was missing out on until I purchased this pair or running shoes. Comfortable right out of the box and still feel great after logging 100+ miles on the shoes. Highly recommend these shoes! I do recommend going on the Asics website and using their online shoe recommendation tool to see if these shoes match your running style.
Excellent pair of hiking shoe.
Great CrossTraining shoes for reasonable price  Great for lifting weights, running, and excercises that involve jumping. Great cross training shoe for Reasonable price.
Very comfortable
Excellent shoe  I've been buying this shoe for years. I used to look forever for a shoe that fit well. As soon as I tried this one, I knew immediately it was right. Several knowledgeable people seeing the shoe, including my podiatrist, volunteered that it is a great shoe.
new pair of monkey shoes  This is my third pair. Love them. Long lasting, do require a touch of thead and glue occasionally. Nonetheless, pair number one is still in service.
Best ever  Simply the most comfortabel shoes I've ever had on my feet. I question their longevity, since they are made so lighly, but I'm lovin' em while I've got'em.
Awesome! Very comfortable, lightweight, and breathable.  These shoes are awesome! I use them for the gym and they are really comfortable, light, and keep your feet cool with how breathable they are. I also like that they are black and kind of go with everything. The only thing I didn't like was how pricey they were. Overall, happy with the purchase.
Best running shoes Ive ever used  Best running shoes Ive ever used.  Used to always have sore feet and numb toes after long runs.  They do seem to wear a little faster than others Ive used, but I believe Ill get well over 500 on the pair before retiring them.  Great shoes
Perfect replacement!  Exactly what I expected!  So nice when that happens!
Gym shoes  They are exactly what I wanted.  They fit perfect and are very comfortable and the same style as my gym shoes I have.
Great for big guys  Im a big guy 275lbs.  These are the only shoes that doesnt make me hurt after 5 miles.
Great pair of sneakers
Shoes fit great and shipping was fast  Shoes fit great and shipping was fast. Came couple days earlier than what they said it would be. Great price! I've been looking for these shoes for a couple years now. Thank you. Thinking of ordering a second pair cuz don't no if I'll find these again and at such a good price.
The best, wish were more deal for different colors  The best , wish were more deal for different colors
Asics Running Shoes  My third Asics Kayano and my favorite yet. I'm an avid runner and a tall guy that crushes the heels of lesser made shoes. I love the new brass color of the Kayano 15. Ordered and received as easily and quickly as anything I've purchased online. A great transaction and terrific product. Highly recommended!
Cool shoes  Lightweight. Go to shoes for errands or quick exercise without having to change shoes.
Excellent shoe for hiking too!  I was a bit concerned with the shoe fit since that is something people find as an issue with these shoes (especially the speedcross 3s), but the shoe fits perfectly. For most shoes/brands Im an US size 8-8.5 and I ordered these ones 8.5 and I still have a bit of room for my toes which is good to have for when your feet starts to swell. I use these shoes for hiking and they feel lightweight and with an excellent grip. Also, the shoe lacing system is a nice feature; you can take them off and back on super quickly. Overall, I love hiking with these shoes and I know I can put a few hundred miles on these bad boys.
Awesomely comfortable!  I love the shoes. They are great!  I walk 5 miles every morning at 5 AM in the shoes and they are very comfortable.  They are light and fit excellent.  I would highly recommend these shoes to anyone who does a lot of walking or running. UPDATE: I have walked 402 miles in these shoes since my initial review. The shoes are perfect, there is No Wear on the soles at all. That is Amazing! The whole shoes are still like the day they were delivered. These shoes are Great! I Love these running shoes.
Excellent Shoes!  I now own 3 pairs of these, I love these shoes! I would buy more Iif I could find them.
So comfortable and great price 89  So comfortable and great price 89.95. Im not a runner but wanted something comfortable to walk in and these are by far the most comfortable Ive ever had.
Great sneakers, worth the money  Great sneakers. I don't use this pair for running though, sticking with older Lunarglide 5 for a while (I don't run a lot so one pair lasts quite long for me). They're a pleasure to walk in and they look very good. I have wide feet and these fit me very well.
however with this shoe I feel buffered from the floor and after 8 hours my feet feel like the beginning of my shift  comfortable/stable running shoe/changes ones gait to a shorter stride and improves posture while running/walking....takes a bit of time to adjust to the zero drop feel..however this has not been an issue for myself... I also ordered another pair exclusively to be worn in my work place which unfortunately has concrete floors...however with this shoe I feel buffered from the floor and after 8 hours  my feet feel like the beginning of my shift...a well constructed pair of footwear...primarily for running but applicable for other simple prolonged activities.....
Great shoe  It is a great shoe. Fit very well. And it is very comfortable.
Good shoe
Perfect for hiking, working out, and running  An all around great piece of footwear. I use it when I hike, run or even just work out. The grip is fantastic In pretty much any environment. Gym floors, sand/dirt/gravel, concrete, even slightly slippery surfaces like wet tile etc.
The best trail running shoes for me  The best trail running shoes for me. I am a 5'4" and 120lbs. Good cushion and smooth foot to toe transition.
I have worn Saucony Guides for the last few years, but the ISO Hurricanes are a much better shoe for my foot with a wider toe box and better cushion and support for the arch.
Great shoes  This is my fifth or sixth pair of these. They are comfortable, durable, sturdy shoes with great traction. I use them as an everyday shoe and as a hiking shoe. I hope Lowa never stops making them. I have very narrow feet and can wear them without thick socks, so they might be less suitable for someone with a wide foot.
Great shoes for running!  Great shoes for the buy.  Would buy again but wider for my feet.
Very comfortable, perfect fit
I love the wide variety of colors and patterns available  I've been consistently wearing the 574 series as my go-to casual shoes since about 2004 and they have always been consistent in their fit, build quality, and longevity. They clean up well with warm water, especially the white foam of the sole that tends to get discolored after a number of months. I love the wide variety of colors and patterns available. Definitely a classic.
My husband love it.
So light!  I order this shoes because the positive reviews. No regrets! Excelent shoes! It fits perfectly and the design is great! the shoes are very light.
These are the best shoes ever  I have been running too many years to say. These are the best shoes ever! Comfort and stability. Also great working dogs! RAVE REVIEWS FROM RAVE RETRIEVERS!
It is jamaican me crazy  I luv it mon!
Nike Roshe Iguanas  These shoes skyrocketed in price,  If you have a chance to purchase these or any other color for 70 or less, do it.  - The mesh isn't solid, it's almost like a sandal because if you take off the shoe the mesh just collapses. - They are extremely comfortable, and if you walk around with them enough you can feel air enter the mesh and it just makes them feel almost non existent at times. - They fit a little less wide than I would prefer, but they are still the most comfortable shoes I own. - I would not run in these, after heavy use for a few days I just feel like they wouldnt last that long if you run in them - They also look really good, I wore these to go register at school and the questions/compliments were almost non-stop.  I strongly recommend not using these every day, unless you don't walk a lot in a typical day. I already purchased some 40$ Converse just to give these a break.  Oh, and don't wear these in the rain, I haven't but i know my feet would get completely soaked.
Very comfortable, light weigt  Very comfortable,  light weigt, I use at work on my feet half a day on cement, my feet not screaming when I get home.
These shoes are Amazing  These are the best shoes. I love the fit, cushioning & overall feel of these shoes. They look really cool too.
Extremely comfortable 10/10 would buy again.
Great footwear. Love em'. New Balance sizing is the most consistent in the sport shoe industry.
Check your size first  A little tighter than I'd like.
ASICS GEL-Exalt  This is my 8th pair of ASICS, and my first pair of GEL-Exalt.  I've had "higher end" and "lower end" models in the ASICS line and have found them all extremely comfortable, long wearing, and an excellent value.  The Exalts fit perfectly, require no break-in and are as good as any ASICS that I've come to love.  Couldn't beat the pricing for this shoe, even while comparing to sale prices at retail stores.  I'm extremely pleased and highly recommend the shoe.
Good shoes  I love Saucony shoes. I bought some over 5 years ago and they're still holding up great, less some dirt. Bought these and they seem to be just as well made and comfortable.
Great choice!
Best Shoe Ever for me, maybe you too!!!  First off these and all NB (I think) offer different width sizes so you can actually get the right fit.  In addition the 992s (this model's predecessor) is designed for runners with a slight pronate which I have.  Stability is what this shoe does and does super well for me.  I didn't find that specification on NBs site for this shoe like the 992s, but it seems online sellers are still saying so, and I have no reason to believe my 993s have been changed either.  As one seller described the shoe online:  "Classic New Balance Men's 993 Tie Running Shoes mean pure stability Here's superior cushioning and enhanced stability for mid to moderate overpronators If your feet tend to roll inward more than necessary when you run, this New Balance Walker can help correct your motion and ease fatigue. This classic design comes loaded with technological features that cushion, stabilize, support and comfort active feet."  I have worn these 990s for many years now and this model just seems as good if not better than its predecessors.  The only reason I buy new ones is frankly from natural wear.  And I don't mean wear that is obvious like frays or the sole is coming off.  I mean MINOR wear on the tread (starting to affect ankle/foot alignment) and slight stretching of shoes fabric/leather (don't get quite as good support).  What's is amazing is these shoes are built so well, that by the time I need a new pair for specific reason these shoes still look and feel great.  So great I wear them for comfort for daily chores.  I swear 1 year on this shoe is like 3-4 months on your average high end, Nike Airs.  Simply put I have found the best shoe ever for me.  If you know or think you need greater stability, I encourage you try them on at a local seller.  PS.  My feet, my knees and even my hips LOVE these shoes  :)
Very comfortable  This was my first time buying running shoes, so I had no idea how these were going to fit. They're incredibly light and very cushioned, the most comfortable shoes ive ever worn. And for this price its a bargain.
ABSOLUTELY LOVING IT!!!!
Ok
Recommended!  Exelent racing shoes!! Recommended!
great running shoes with a sharp look
Best shoes ever!!!  I am on my feet 12 plus hours as an Emergency Room Nurse and I can tell you these have been about the best shoes I have ever had. Comfortable and hold up really well. If you believe my phone I average about 15 miles a week of walking at work.
Comfortable shoes!  One of the best purchases I ever made in sport shoes. Great quality of materials, fitted as expected.
Fantastic shoes  Awesome shoes. Only my 2nd pair of Brooks. The first ones were trance 12 and I loved them. These are have a bit of a different feel, but they are light, stable, and supportive during even the most rigorous workouts.
Love these shoes. Fit perfect feel perfect  Great shoes. I'm partial to New Balance and I love these shoes
Awesome  Good item.
Nice look. Fits great. Durable.
New balance are the most comfortable shoe!
Love it, but follow the instructions on use  Title says it all- ended up wearing these in a situation early in the process of breaking myself into them where I couldn't change out when I need to, and I ended up with a tendon/foot cramp that was making me think stress fracture. The company includes guidelines on getting accustomed to these shoes, and I recommend listening to them about it. I'm not a super-heavy guy, either.  PS- find a place where you can physically try these on before purchasing, or be prepared to do some back-and-forth mailing until you get the right ones. Sizes run slightly different from model to model, and you can't count on their sizing chart to tell you what's going to be right for you.
we're glad we did  We read the reviews and knew to order a half size up...we're glad we did!  Great shoes!
Great deal  Exactly like my Tailwind 5's.  Not quite as rigid and a  little flatter feeling  shoe than shox or  run lites but excellent still. Very comfortable. Arrived in perfect condition.  Nice looking.
Light and Comfortable  Bought these for an everyday shoe, but they are definitely built for active use. Very light, breathe well, and feel very durable. I wear out shoes very quickly, and I feel like these will stand up to the abuse I dish out.
Wow  One best pair of shoes I brought. Very good
Great for feet support  That's the only shoe my son will wear. Perfect fit and support for someone who needs right arch and good balance and support.
Mudder Aproved  Felt great, and held up the same. Highly recommended.
Ugly, but nothing works better for me.  Altra still can't figure our how to make a good looking shoe (they are ugly as sin), but nothing comes close to working as well for me as their Olympus.  Knee and foot pain was just something I thought I would always have to live with until I bought my first pair of Altras a year ago. I was amazed at the difference they make even just walking and standing for extended periods.  They just work too well for me to care about looking like a dork wearing them.
Great workout shoe!  These are great for running but I use them at the gym. They've got good support, not too heavy though. Great color combo. Durable threads. My first New Balance shoe!
Very good price.  Always a great fit.  Good price for the GT-2000
Great shoe!  I would purchase the shoe again.
Love it
Love them
... 20 years and these new 990 v4 shoes are better than before  I have wore these shoes for over 20 years and these new 990 v4 shoes are better than before.  I walk about 5 miles a day and these shoes hold up better than any other shoe that I have ever worn.  I will keep buying new balance.
Great Comfortable Shoe
Loves  These are the only shoes my boyfriend will wear. He wears them with everything. Super comfy and good on your feet
No dogs a barkin  I am amazed how comfortable my shoes are! I have an odd sized foot (12.5 4E) and New Balance comes through for me EVERY time. Please keep making half sizes and quality foot wear.
Great shoes! I cannot believe what a bargain these were!
Perfect for my Dad
They were incredibly comfortable and fit perfectly  I have not run in them yet, but I wore these sneakers to work for two consecutive days to break them in. They were incredibly comfortable and fit perfectly. I am very happy with them.
good
very nice with the cheap price
Silky soft insole (heel) is a very nice improvement over prior GT-2000 iterations.
Everything perfect guys! Cheers!!
My new trail running and mountain bike shoe  I bought these when I could not find a decent trail shoe from NB or Brooks - which I traditionally ran in because of the EE width option - I prefer a wider toe box so my toes are all cramped up. When NB and Brooks failed me I began the search and discovered the Altra brand. the reviews across the forums are incredible. They are so highly rated I had to try them. They are awesome. I only run on trails, in the woods, with roots and rocks and such. These shoes are not only incredibly comfortable the are an incredibly technical shoe. I decided to try them for mountain biking as well as I alternate days - run one, mtn bike the next, so on - and was so pleased that I now only use this shoe, period. I'm also buying another pair for my "kick around town" shoes. They are that great.
sturdy and you can tell ithey will last  Just came in the mail, Awsome shoe, sturdy and you can tell ithey will last
Good shoe - comfortable
Comfortable  Good quality material
Great running shoe and support a good caase  Completely satisfied no isues
great shoes!
Wearing
Looks and wears well  My son ordered this shoe after having another of this brand he liked. Sizing was exactly the same as the first shoe (as we had hoped/expected). Good value.
Winner !
Nice shoes!
GREAT  I love these shoes! They fit perfectly and are so comfortable. The best past is that sometimes when I walk the material is so comfortable, I don't even feel like I have them on. They are not stiff and they are definitely eye catching. I am almost certain someone tried to steal them from me one night walking home from campus. Now, that's messed up but it says something about them. Great shoes for a great price!
Amazing shoses  Even lighter than NB MT00. You really feel the ground.  Very nice to run with.  I used the "See how it fits" tool on New Balance site to know witch size to order. And it is just good, a bit larger would have been great.
tennis needed  My tennis are so pretty and so comfy I am thinking about ordering another pair. Absolutely love love love them.
Newe Balance Zip - The future of running Shoes!  So this is my fourth pair of NB ZIPs. And the reason I keeppurchasing is the quality and comfort. So you ask why do I have so many pairs? Well I'm an avid runner and average about 30 miles a week. So given that shoes will last from 6-12 monthys based on running I go through shoes rather quickly. So the great part of NB ZIPs other than the fact they are made in the USA is the comfort. New Balance is one of the few shoes that offer different widths from Narrow to Extra-wide. And with shoes - Comfort is paramount. As for cushioning the shoe feels like a champ! This is a solid shoe with excellent value. A strong recommendation to any runner (beginning to avid)!
COMFORTABLE  I LOVE THIS SNEAKERS VERY COMFORTABLE
Fit great after exchange.  So happy it was SO easy to set up and do the return for the previous pair that was too small. These came quickly and fit fine.
Top Notch. Made to be comfy - AND - Durable!  Fit is perfect - as a 13 2E should fit. No suprises. Fantastic support. Excellent padding. I have no idea what kind of feet people have that say you can't get a great fit out of these.
Shipped quickly, fit and look better than expected.  I love these shoes and they shipped out to Afghanistan extremely fast.  The shoes fit as expected and are of good quality.  I would recommend these to others.
Best shoes I've ever worn  I can't run due to foot issues, but I work out every day for an hour or two at the gym, and at least 30 to 45 minutes is spent on the cardio machines. Every other month or so for the past several years I've had to stop the cardio workouts due to debilitating foot pain near the balls and arches of my feet that can last for weeks.  I always loved New Balance because it seems to be the only brand that fits me well.  But I never understood the numbering system for each shoe model, and I don't think I've ever had a pair above 600.  I bought these shoes from a department store clearance outlet several months ago, and what a revelation they are!  Now I understand that the higher the model number, the more advanced the shoe.  After researching this further on the internet, it appears that when you get above the 800 level numbers, the quality of the shoe takes a huge leap, and so does the price.  But you get what you pay for.  While the lower model numbers aren't bad shoes, the higher numbered models incorporate greater and greater technology to add stability, support, cushioning, and durability while at the same time making them lighter. And with my touchy feet, I need all the shoe technology I can get!  In the several months I've owned these, my foot pain flare-ups have almost completely disappeared. Now I'm looking forward to trying out other high end New Balance models.
Nice shoes,light,comfy.little tight first day,all good now.
Very lightweight shoe. The fit is right on target for me at a size 11(D) fit perfect. I am just working off an injury and this shoe fits great and the ride is better than I anticipated. I was skeptical that Sketchers made a legitimate running shoe, but the Go run 3 exceeded all my expectations so far.
Good
Comfy, functional, great!  Bought these as a gift for my brother and he loves them!
that were comfortable and I could walk and stand for hours in  I needed shoes for work,  that were comfortable and I could walk and stand for hours in. I must say these shoes are worth the price. They fit true to the size and am completely satisfied with my purchase
Great shoe. Good price.  Saucony Triumph 5 feels great and runs even better. Although it is not the most comfortable when standing, it has the right amount of cushion and support and spring when running. Is relatively light although some other running shoes weigh less. Shoe sells for about $120 elsewhere. Very happy with this purchase.
Most Comfortable  This is my third pair of Solomon's. Like this shoe a lot, very comfortable, light and good looking. Soles hopefully don't wear as fast as the version 3's did.
Excellent shoe.  One of the few I can wear that doesn't hurt my feet.
these are the coolest shoes that I own
They broke in as expected and are extremely comfortable for a tennis shoe  My husband loves these shoes.  They broke in as expected and are extremely comfortable for a tennis shoe. He plays only once or twice per week and they are in good shape after nearly a year.  Lightweight and comfort are the advantages of this shoe.
These are great  I love these shoes, have had them for a while now and want to buy another pair to have.
Oldest son loves these running shoes.
Best Progrids I've owned  Very comfortable and lightweight. Great price. Ive owned several pairs of Progrids over the years. These are the best. Very happy with the purchase.
Never go wrong with Adidas  Got this for my husband and so far there has been no complaint of cramped toes or discomfort..
Nice look and nice feel
Great Comfort and Support  This is my Fourth pair of these. Great Comfort and Support.
Great shoes for the price!  I love these shoes.  I haven't ran more than about 5 miles in them so I can speak to anything beyond that, but so far I have several runs under my belt with them and they fit very nicely with no rubbing for me.  I had a set of Asics prior to this and found through my research their sizing charts are very similar...which proved to be true.
great purchase  Great fit. Overall perfect purchase!
Amazing shoe very very light weight
These shoes arrived quickly and are great. The real deal. I wish they had more options in my size..
Excellent Running Shoes  I bought these for my husband and he loves these shoes. He has had leg and foot issues in the past that have hindered his running. With these shoes, he hasn't had any issues at all.
A solid, attractive, comfortable and affordable shoe used for daily walking and casual wear.  I can no longer run due to a hip replacement and some spinal surgeries, but I walk 5 or more miles a day. I find the color scheme very appealing and the shoes felt quite comfortable right out of the box. I have owned these for about two weeks now and have walked in them every day, several days as much as 10 miles. From the first day these shoes have been comfortable and provided solid support. Naturally, at this point I cannot comment on durability, but the shoes appear to be well made and of quality materials. I would not hesitate to purchase this product again or purchase anything from this vendor.
highly recommended  Nice athletic shoes. This is my second pair, and would highly recommend the purchase.
Great Shoes  These are exactly what I was looking for...have the same kind and just needed another pair. Good for running and working out...DYAD's haven't let me down yet
1/2 size to small and know body to contact to get help!  I have other new balance shoes and they are 9 1/2 4e and fit great and they are a  1  size to small. So order accordingly. Very difficult to contact Amazon to get the right size, only return and place a new order.
The best running shoes ever!!
Made in U S A (hopefully just no assembled )  Very comfortable shoe. The fit for me was perfect and the styling and made in U S A was great as well ..
Good!  It is a really good running shoe, arrived yesterday and I used it this morning for a 2mile run...it served it's purpose, just that it was a bit small which is no fault of anyone... I just ordered 7.5 because i wanted it very tight on my feet and also there was no size 8 for the colour i wanted but I am size  8/8.5...I loved the purchase
Excellent, shoe...Stable and durable
Great walking shoe.
Good fitting shoe. I use it to perform my workouts at the gym. Thanks NB!
They feel great.  I've bought these shoes before in an earlier style and color. They feel great.
Good shoe.  Great shoe, approximates the GT 2170 that was foolishly discontinued.  This is closest to it, although I think a little less sturdy (so the 4, although would make it 4-1/2 if that were available) but still good so far, only worn it about 1 1/2 wks.
hiking use  good lightweight alternative to crosstrainers for hiking. dry very quick and can even feel then on your feet. also they have good traction on wet rock
Thin and light.  The EL-X's offer much more ground feel than any of the previous Vibram's I have owned.  They are very comfortable to wear when I have to have shoes on.
Good look with comfort!  I bought these for work and love the comfort as I am on my feet all day.  No break in time needed.  I have other colors in this same style because I liked how they fit.  There is enough room with my orthotics.
Great sneakers, love them
perfect fit !  i've used this shoe as my marathon race day shoe for several years. recently it was discontinued. wish they would bring it back. it is light weight, comfy, and provides just the correct  amount of support . very pleased with the seller, product and delivery!
extremely comfortable hiking shoe  stylish and functional. extremely comfortable hiking shoe. I went on a 15 mile hike, 4000ft elevation change, barely after breaking them in. feet felt great, blister free.
Perfect  Love the shoes, fits perfectly and it feels better than any golf shoes I had
I need a bigger size
this is my second pair from the line up and they fit perfectly and comfortable.  whatever reebok has been doing lately with their crossfit shoes, it's definitely working. this is my second pair from the line up and they fit perfectly and comfortable.
Fantastic Running Shoes  These have changed my mind about Adidas. They are extremely comfortable for long distance running. I constantly take them out on 15 mile runs every week and they continue to impress me. Now my dog needs a break and I want to keep going. I am new to the bungie laces but love them now that I have gotten used to them. Will definitely buy again.
Great  Probably the best running shoes I have wore, thats with 10 years of military and an additional 6 years as a civilian.  I have bought more expenive shoes, as many different brands.
Great Shoe for the money.  Fantastic Shoe. I am an Asics guy and like wearing these everywhere, not just running. They look great and have great support. For 109 dollars when most stores are $169-199, I couldn't go wrong. Very satisfied.
Just bought my 2nd pair  I'm a bit heavier than your average runner, pronate, and train exclusively on pavement. On me, under those conditions, I LOVE these shoes. I just finished 400 miles on my last pair, and bought a second pair. Even then, the uppers were fine. But I'd worn out the springy things on the heels. I suspect that someone that does not pronate as much as I do could get at least another 100 miles out of these shoes, if not a good bit more more.  I had a persistent stride problem that immediately disappeared when I switched to these shoes. However I changed a few other things at that same time, so I cannot positively attribute the improvement to these shoes. But it's a data point to consider...  The only negative I can come up with is that in those 400 miles, on maybe three occasions a rock lodged in one of the holes in the little springy things on the bottom of the shoe. And when that happens, I guarantee you that you will stop running and get it out right there and then. You can't easily run in these shoes when a rock gets lodged like that. However they are not particularly inclined to pick up rocks. At once every hundred miles or more, IMO it's not really a problem.  Overall, fantastic shoes for me. I should have bought a third pair for after the next 400 miles...
Good product but not sturdy enough have about 8 pairs now just need a bit morr confort on the bottom  Arnie
too small  Great shoe but too smal! If you are between 2 sizes use the larger one!
Good
Great is just the beginning for these shoes.  New Balance has been a blessing from heaven.  If you wear wide width shoes or even medium width shoes, you have got to try New Balance wide with shoes -- your feet will thank you every day you wear them.  Wonderful, Fantastic, Amazingly Comfortable, Durable, Stylish -- all these and more apply to the New Balance line of shoes.  I buy nothing but New Balance and have no plans on  changing since they make tennis shoes, running shoes, waling shoes, dress shoes, casual shoes and more --- Thank you New Balance.
Comfortable, very good quality product!!
Perfect
great
Took some getting use to...  Once i got use to running in them, (It took about a month/ Running 3 days a week) I got use to running on my forefoot and my feet no longer hurt. My feet always use to hurt in the heels from old fashioned "Running" Shoes... lol.
Good looking shoe!!
Great fit and very comfortable.
These are the best shoes that I've ever owned  These are the best shoes that I've ever owned. I kept buying the same pair of shoes over and over again and my dogs began to bark.  I walk about 7 miles a day and needed a change.  After much research, I went with Reebok Skycell DMX. I found that I was tensing my feet on the forward stride due to the lack of support and flat sole of my old standbys. These shoes made me realize that, by allowing a comfortable rolling stride. My feet never felt better. They also have a removable orthopedic insole.  The air bubbles on the sole are very firm. So it's not off putting, balance wise.  You'll love them!
Good for wide feet.  These are perfect for my feet. Bought a pair at Kohls and decided to keep buying on Amazon. Memory foam is good but my dogs wear holes in the heel and ball after about 4 months.
This brand always fits true to size.
Replaced another pair that I had for years.
Great Shoe.  Great Shoe.
Great shoe. Merchant was quick  Great shoe.  Merchant was quick!
These are my favorite NB shoes. I have short wide feet, and the fit me well.
my boy doesn't want to take them off!  the shoes are comfortable, strong and look perfect! masculine and "butch" - young boys love it! he wears them to school, performs all his sports in them and impresses his pals! great design and brinkmanship! sport shoes that fit personality of young men!
worth every penny...however be ready for others to think you got dressed in the dark...  I love the colors of these shoes...I had to figure out the coordinating size in mens as I purchased the ladies about a month ago and they have a lot of pinks and purples...I had to have these once I saw them as they covered the other colors in the rainbow...It is true People will look at you with 2 and 3 double takes...I was also asked on more than one occasion if I had two different shoes on!!!  It's alright I love them them, they are so comfortable, lightweight, and beautiful...
Awesome shoe  These are my FAVORITE shoes I have ever purchased. Never owned Salomon before but I will definitely buy more now after having these.
Like walking on clouds! Very good !
Very comfortable !!
Fit as expected
A pair in every color!  My husband loves these shoes. He has a pair in white, black and grey. Definitely recommend!
Awesome red! Love them!
Love them
Great shoes!  Love them! My husband is a swim coach and Salomon's are one of the few brands that holds up well pacing around the pool. We bought two more pairs in different colors!
good looking and most importantly fit is great
Great Shoe!  Fit well and very comfortable. Wore out in less than a year, but that was because they were worn for everything. Highly recommended!
great shoes for narrow feet  the only American shoe company that makes narrow width shoes
Good item, shipped on time.  Good item, shipped on time.
Husband loves these shoes  Husband wore these shoes until the soles were done.  This is his favorite brand of running shoes for his type of feet.  He has flat feet (well very small arches) and these are the best shoes for him for running.
Love my shoes
which is probably good for a running shoe)  It fit as expected (a bit snug, which is probably good for a running shoe). I've been wearing it for some 2-mile runs. The sole feels nice and soft.
great shoe but not very durable for everyday use  wearing a little faster than expected, great shoe but not very durable for everyday use!!
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE WALKING SHOES  AS I SAID BEFORE, THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE WALKING SHOES.... FIT WELL, LAST LONG AND LOOK GOOD
These shoes made me fall in love with the company all over again  Wow. I have been a fan of Adidas for a long time (over 40 years). These shoes made me fall in love with the company all over again. I purchased the shoes 1/2 size bigger than my normal size and they fit perfectly. Plenty of room for the toes. A little bulky but they are trail runners. I purchased these shoes for a trip to Las Vegas. Sounds weird but we usually do a lot of walking there and I knew I would need something comfortable. I did some research on the new boost technology created by Adidas and deceided to give the shoes a try. No leg fatigue what so ever after walking through 2 airports and the Vegas strip over a 3 day vacation. Amazing. Great traction because of the Continental tire rubber and the fore foot and heel have the boost technology foam (or whatever it is). I will be using these shoes for trail running soon. Right now I am enjoying how they feel just walking around in them.
Awesome!
Walk on clouds  Very comfy pair of shoes. Bought 2 pair they are so nice
I like it
loves the color and super happy to have this in two colors.
They provide good support and are long wearing  I already own a pair of these shoes and wear them everyday. They provide good support and are long wearing. This gives me a second pair.
4E widths from Nike  I was so pleased to find that Amazon stocks Nike's in 4E width for men. I didn't even know they existed. These are very good looking and very comfortable shoes, and I have received many compliments. Again, I am really happy to have found good looking shoes that fit!
Very good shoe, use it for work and the gym and so far I'm pleased.
Love it
Very nice shows but not original
Great Shoe and price!  Ordered for my husband who runs a lot and goes through running shoes like no other! He is in the Army and needed a pair of PT shoes asap! They came quick fit perfect and he says they are better than his $120.00 running shoes!
Only choice for me  I've been running on the 2000 series since high school cross country in the late 90s. I strayed from them once a couple years ago and was miserable for 3 months before I tossed the infidel shoes and came running back to the 2160. I'm a fairly serious runner and regularly put in 10-20 mile runs, and these keep my feet comfortable and happy. I also rock a 4E width, and Asics is one of the only shoes that will accommodate me. The 2170 is a nice improvement overall and I don't plan on straying from the fold again.  TL;DR - If you have wide feet, a reasonably neutral gait and put in a lot of miles, get these.
My husband loves them.
I am very pleased with the large toe box.
Re-like!  Perfect shoes!!!!
love the show, but it's on the narrow side  It's a great shoe for city and short hikes! The sole gives nice traction and the entire shie is very light.
Super walking shoe!  Bought these for my hubby.  He says his knee and hip pain are almost eliminated.  It's so nice to have a happy walking partner.
Very good
Good shoe, holding up well
Nice color!  Comfy shoes. Nice color!
Fast shipping. Fit perfectly and really comfortable. This is the 4th pair of Ravenna I had bought and their awesome. I update my running shoes at least every 6 to 8 months . the old pair still feels great but I need it the ones, the shoes look great. Thanks
This is the only shoe I buy for exercise!  Sooo comfortable. I have tried many of the more popular and far more expensive name brand shoes and I have returned to the Saucony brand. They fit great and are flexible and breathable. I use them primarily for cross-fit at the gym and for long walks. Everyone has their own opinion but for me............I really like these.
Triple A+  Working outdoors as a professional landscaper puts one's feet at the will of the elements. These shoes withstand pretty much all that has been thrown at them since I purchased them, although the term "water-resistant" needs to be taken with a grain of salt (at least in the Pacific Northwest). I wear these every day, all day, working outside, and they have not lost any quality. The traction 6 months on had began to wear down somewhat, but I do not find myself slipping more than usual. The soles and toe box are very well and thoughtfully constructed, and still have not failed me. In addition to the water-resistance being somewhat suspect, I have also broken a shoelace. However, that happened in the past two weeks, and I have been wearing them every day, 10 hours per day for the past 8 months. They (the strings) have withstood searing heat, bitter cold, snow, rain, over-traction, pulling, pushing, stretching, with exceptional aplomb until the break, so I do not hold that against the quality. After so much use, I continue to wear them and will in the coming months very likely re-purchase a similar pair. I would recommend them for your trail hikes, and for those with the ability to get away with it, working outdoors in them has been a treat.
Another great product from New Balance  This shoe fits so well they are almost like slippers.  I use elastic laces with them and have very happy feet.  I have also purchased two more pair for backup.  Unfortunately quality products disappear to quickly in the shoe market so if you find something you like buy in bulk.
great fit  These new balance shoes in this size always fit me perfectly, so comfortable I can wear them for hrs. right away.
Great
Awesome shoes for the price  Awesome shoes for the price. Make sure you know your shoe size, and order accordingly. These running shoes appear to fit true to size.
Love my ASICS 
Nice shoes
Great fit and durable.  Holds up well to the trails.
Another great pair of Asics  I am partial to Asics, and these new shoes do exactly what I wanted.
New Balance Is the One!  I've bought New Balance for several years now. I've had their walking shoes and recently 2 pair of running shoes that I use for WALKING. What a difference! I used their size charts to guide me with these running shoes based on the NB brand of walking shoe I was most comfortable in. You can even get 4X widths!  I got total comfort right out of the box. NO guesswork. I walked 2.5 miles that first day, and had no issues. I wear orthotics in ALL my shoes (heel spurs no longer give me any pain-without surgery) so I appreciate NB's removable insoles to accommodate my devices. NB also seems to do more extensive research and ergonomic design than some other shoe companies. (IMHO)
Excellent shoe for teenage boy with over pronation.
Like to workout in them!!!
Great shoe. Very comfortable & good for running.
Good arch support!  Better arch support than GT2000, at least on me feet. Purchase  size larger than your dress shoe size. Very comfortable, great for walking, jogging and/or running.
Great grip, amazing comfort!  I bought these shoes after I almost slipped during a USPSA match. Searching what other competitors wear came down to cleats or a trail running shoe. I went with these because of the soft grip instead of a harder cleat (better for wet wood etc. and I am beyond pleased with the comfort.
Habitual Salomon user  These are the shoes my husband wears for trail runs and the same shoes that we have our teenage son who can destroy any other high end shoe, cannot destroy these shoes.  We love the color options.
Good for joggers.  My husband has worn Asics for years. He has worn other styles, but this seems to be a favourite. He usually wears size 9, but with this brand he wears 9.5.
Very comfortable & true to size for me (10D  Very comfortable & true to size for me (10D, my feet are on the narrow end, though). They've held up well so far, my first minimalist running shoe.  My back & ankles feel amazing for a change after over a decade running in "normal" "motion control" shoes.  But don't think you won't feel little rocks on the trail (like bigger than 3/4inch diameter)... yeah... hurts.  Maybe I'm a wuss but I try and keep these strictly for road/track running or trails without big pebbles.
Send me another pair. (Free) LOL.. bought another pair.. Thanks...
Nice shoes
Thank you
Love these sneakers. No socks needed. Great ventilation for the feet.
but very comfortable!  Somewhat narrow, but very comfortable!
Great shoe and price  Great shoe and price.fast shipping. Would purchase from again.
Perfect
love them !!  fast shipment
... husband is hard to fit so we were both pleased to have them fit perfectly  Very prompt to send them and my husband is hard to fit so we were both pleased to have them fit  perfectly .
Terrific shoes that are very snug and stable.  Love them already.
Excellent shoes, met my expectations thanks Excellent product, 100% recommended.
Overall great shoe  Comfortable walking shoe. Would be careful in the rain as this shoe is mostly mesh. Great heel support, and feel open in the toe box.  They are my go-to walking shoe!
Aaaaahhh...  I've got BIG feet. These are BIG shoes. I have happy BIG feet now.
Nice fit, comfortable. Will surely buy again.
Great shoe comfortable right out of the box.
Great running shoes  I used Brooks PureFlow 4 for the past two years and it was great running shoes.  The PureFlow 6 is even better than PureFlow 4.
Extremely comfortable and long wearing  Don't know how but the New Balance 600 series keeps putting out a tremendous product year after year. It's the only sneakers I've bought for the last 10 years. Extremely comfortable and long wearing. Rick
These are very good running shoes.  Should note how well they breath to ventalate your foot.
Just love these  I love these running shoes.  Perfect balance of support and cushion
I like it very much.
Good fit.
Great road/trail shoes  I run 30-35 miles a week and these are the best shoes I have ever run in...the Cascadia 5's were equally as good!
Great bargain for the price and nice to get it in mens small size.
As good as first Paramount, disregard what other negative reviewers are saying  If you loved the first Paramount, you are more than likely going to love the 2nd version.  Yes, there are a few mods, but it is gives the same support and cushion as you would expect from the first. In my honest opinion, if you are a loyal Paramount fan, you won't be disappointed. Happy running!
A bit narrow looking at first... but fits even my husbands boxy German feet :) He loves them so they are 5 stars in my book!
Love these shoes  You can't go wrong with Asics shoes.  These were a great price.  Running Warehouse sent two pair though.  I called and am returning it. Karma is a bitch. The shoes fit and are so easy on your feet!
Good Value // American Made?  This is a good solid shoe for the money and I understand they are made in America.  A solid workhorse of a shoe, especially for the larger male.
very nice pair of tennis shoes, lightweight
Nice sneaker, light and comfy  Nice sneaker , light and comfy . I like this brand and always look for their sales...
They feel great, a lot like slippers  These are my first pair of no rise flat shoes.  They feel great,  a lot like slippers.  I haven't tried to go running in them, I just wear them  walk in until I can build up foot strength.
Love them
Comfortable shoes.
Great for heavy WODs!  These are good shoes but are best suited for floor work and lifting rather than running. I prefer more cushion in the sole and believe the Reebok Nano may have been a better choice for me.
Listen to the reviews  I have been a advent trail runner for some time. Twice as long as the old pavement running which I have been hitting hard for about 10 yrs now. I was in the market to look for a shoe with a more normal / natural run feel. Coming off a major injury to the ankle and both feet I need something that was stable and supportive / responsive to the terrain. After going to a few running stores and talking to some sports therapist about my next step to move forward, I look around at what my said to look for. I found everything I need in the Altra Men's Superior Trail runners. Cool, comfort and most importantly support to all terrain. The toe box was wide and roomy for a great push off. the tread was responsive to just about everything I throw at it. The zero drop as a nice transition for me, for one I like to run on the forefoot and with out any extra sole in the heel this shoe was a great choice. Now for some of the things to look out for. Do buy a half a size larger if not a full size, especially if you have longer toes than normal. This will pay off in the toe box as your feet start to get use to the large toe box area. Other then that that is all I have to say about the negative part of the shoe. This item was delivered early and the package and product was in great shape.
ASICS ROCK  FIRST SHOES I HAVE BOUGHT ONLINE AND COULD WEAR THEM RIGHT OF BOX...BEST BUY!
EXCELLENT  This is my second pair. It was really hard to find in my size. Either they have sold too many or not enough have been made. Excellent shoe which I actually use for pretty much everything from running going to the gym or going out when I am dressed in casual clothing. I still have the other pair (white) and alternate these. I find them much better than the evo because with the holes they allow your foot to breathe and thus eliminate the one and only one fault with the Evo - which is they start to smell after a while of heavy use. I would prefer to go barefoot but alas it is not really accepted anywhere where I live so this is the aboslute best alternative and more acceptable and practical than flip flops. They are brilliant to run in and since using these shoes all my knee pains have disappeared. I put on a old (but in good condition) pair of Nike lunar glides the other day to see how they felt and frankly I could not get on with them at all (even after having run for many hundreds of kilometers in them in the past). After you get used to Vivobarefoot shoes there is no going back! I love them! I must also highly commend Amazon for their prompt (item arrived well before time stated) and professional service.
Sixth pair of Brooks  I've been wearing Brooks sneakers for the past 8 years and people give me a strange look when I tell them how much I spent on a pair of sneakers. But, when I tell them how long this sneakers last and the quality of them, that's when people agree with me.. you get what you paid for.
Some of my favorite shoes I own!
Good Running Shoes for Hubby  My husband runs between 60 and 80 miles a month on average and goes through sneakers / running shoes.  This is the second pair of these we bought on Amazon.  Different color this time since other color wasn't available.  I am giving it 5 stars although he wears a 9.5/10 usually and we had to buy a 10.5 so he had toe room.
ASICS are my go to brand for running shoes  I have been using ASICS shoes for many years now.  They have a consistent build & fit quality at a very affordable price.  I have always had a bit of a problem with other shoes either being too large or too small even though I stick with the correct shoe size for me.  ASICS always fit first time, every time and the quality is top notch.  This is really important when buying a shoe on line since you do not have tha capability to try them on before buying.  I am sticking with ASICS for now!
Look great  Love these shoes, they look so good on and feel great
and the 20s are wonderful.  I wore Wave Riders for years, then stopped. I decided to give them try again, and the 20s are wonderful.
comfortable with long distance runs
Very comfortable sturdy shoes.  I am very happy with these shoes they are sturdy and extremely comfortable and well made. I don't run but I do walk a lot. I am a bigger guy and have a wide flat foot. Highly recommend!
Excellent.
Almost Perfect  I'd give this a 4.9 if I could, the discount being for only one reason. First, the pros: Very lightweight - - they weigh two ounces less than crocs; good protection or support in all but rocky terrain; and a presentable appearance - - you can go out in public with these, though you probably wouldn't want to go out on a date wearing them.  Note, I bought these not for running, I'm not into barefoot running, so don't rely on me for that. I bought them for a couple other reasons: backpacking camp shoes (wanted lightweight, protection against natural ground surfaces in the Sierras  . . . check!); water shoes (ditto re backpacking: can throw them on to cross streams . . . check!); around-the-house-plus shoes: like slippers, easily put on, no laces, can go out in the back yard or out front and take out the garbage, chase the dog, look at the garden, etc. . . . check!).  The only question I have that would knock the perfection-for-purpose rating down for me is the tongue. I haven't seen this on this product that I can tell, but, the minimal tongue never seems to lay flat when I put on the shoes. Instead, it crimps up and I either just ignore the feeling, or have to fiddle around with my finger for a while, smoothing it out. Or, as I started doing, simply removing the tongue, which is connected near the front of the shoe.  The tongue-removal detracts from appearance in my mind. But, I figure that if I want to go to the grocery store or something like that in these, I'll put on a pair of ankle socks, which I probably would do anyway, not being a sandal-type guy. By the way, all the comments about rubbing and scraping in other reviews . . . I can't see why those folks don't just put a sock on it, so to speak.
nice kicks  the fit is perfict so comfortable.
Definitely.....on the Go!!!!  Really happy with my purchase. They work very well and am totally satisfied with the performance. I would recommend this model without any doubt!!
asics  Ive put in about 15 to 20 miles on them already they feel nice with good cushion for my flat flat but sporty feet...lets see if they stand the test of time ,but for the price they are great shoes
Highly recommended!!!  The arch support question should not affect the review of this product as it came with a "normal" sole...I have special orthotics that give me the support I need.  I am however curious as to when the standardized sizes became smaller...I have worn 13 Regulars in every kind of shoe my entire adult life, now apparently I need 14 Regulars, I have shoes from just 10 years ago that are correct...what's with that.  Anyhow, these shoes are awesome, nearly as comfortable as my combat boots and sometimes they feel more comfortable.  Highly recommended!!!
Just what I was looking for  Fit just right. Are light weight and comfortable. Easy to put spikes in and take out. Love the look of shoes as well.
great sneaker  I purchased these for ball hockey and they did not disappoint.  The are the official shoe of the Hatrick Swayzes.
thanks
SWEEETNESS!  These shoes have made love to my feet every step I make, I wanna marry these shoes and take them home make sweet love to them and have their baby.
Great show love the style  Great shoes. $75 was a great price for the quality. Glad to see Nike is selling more products on Amazon
Super light  Love these. Probably my favorite NBs all-time and I've gone through many over the years. Feather light.
muy bien
Great shoes  Love them
Super light weight yet well cusioned for the long hall trail run.
Best Tennis Shoe I have every owned!  These are the very best tennis shoes I have every owned!!!  I have severe arthritis in both ankles and knees from an accident, so I am constantly looking for "miracle" shoes.  Well, I think I have found them!!!  It will take some doing to get me to ever consider any other tennis shoe!!  Wish I could wear them everyday to work!
Love 'em! Great buy and comfortable  Love 'em! Great buy and comfortable
very good
nice and wide  i wear a 9 4E and they fit perfectly
Perfect...  Shoe works as advertised. Mega-kudos for offering a 13.5--half sizes are hard to come by. And shipping was fast also. Thanks.
The best for me  I have had 2 pairs of this model Asics shoe in 2 yrs for all cross training use, especially walking, in which it fits me better and I can walk better in this shoe than any other I have ever owned.  I have some disability in one leg.  Now I find out that Asics has discontinued this great shoe which retailed for$75. and the new shoe of equal specifications retails for $100.+  BUT THAT DOESN'T GUARANTEE IT WILL BE AS GOOD OR BETTER! I now have a pair of the gel-exalt that I have been trying out and it suits me as well or very near as well as the discontinued gel-turbulent and weights the same, 11.5 oz. in my size 11D. List price is $85. but they can at times be purchased from Amazon for as little as $45.  I also find the gel-lyte33 to be quite good and it weighs only 8.5 oz. in my size.
Very supportive and comfortable, as well as affordable.  These are a great lower-priced shoe for running short or moderate distances, if you tend to overpronate.  If you require more cushioning, or a neutral shoe, I would not recommend them, especially for longer distances.
Great work shoes.  One of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. Light and soft soles. Wear to work and and stand a lot. Have ordered a second pair.
Really good for hiking or up hill walking.
Products was good. Tanx
Worth the money  Great support and back saver. Im a heal/toe runner with flat feet. Definitely prefer these than my Saucony Guides.
Asics gel-kahana 8 trail very comfortable sneakers.  Asics gel-kahana  8 trail very comfortable sneakers .
Really like the shoe  Really like the shoe. My goal was to buy a shoe that would have my foot as bare foot as possible ,  and these were perfect.
Love these shoes.  Most comfortable shoes I own.  I was running barefoot/minimalist (no longer doing so) and these were my preferred shoes when running minimalist or when out and about.  Road tread pattern is smooth and not noticable.  Inside is soft and shoes can be comfortably worn without socks if you prefer.  "Normal" toe box is roomy and saves you from the "toe shoes" conversation everyone wants to have if you are wearing Vibram Five Fingers.  Only drawback/concern is that portions of the sole are made of a softer material (that which composes the midsole on traditional running shoes) rather than harder rubber.  Because of this I have concerns about the durability of the sole as a whole.  I've had these for many months, though, and no problems yet.
Great Shoes  These are my favorite brand of shoe.  I'm on my feet all the time and these shoes are comfortable and long lasting.
My daily use shoe.  I first discovered these shoes at a high end shoe shop, where they analyze your feet, stance, and gait. They also ask about how you'll be using the shoes. I said it would be for every day wear plus jogging. This was a year ago. They recommended (and I bought) the Dyad 8. The shoe is good for about a year of regular use so when I was ready for a replacement I bought the Dyad 9 at Amazon. I love this shoe. Comfortable, supportive, good traction.
GReat shoes!  The shoes fit perfectly and are very comfortable. The color shown was exactly the color I wanted. Surprisingly, people often tell me how they love the shoes. I was afraid that people would judge that a 79-year-old man has no business wearing bright orange shoes, but I was wrong.
... out of the box the Ghost 9s were a perfect fit and felt great on the road  Right out of the box the Ghost 9s were a perfect fit and felt great on the road.  The shoes are well cushioned without feeling heavy. They compliment very well the Brooks Pure Flows I use for shorter runs. Up till now my longer runs have been in ASICS Nimbus, but the Ghost 9s are my new favorites!
What a great shoe!!  The shoes are awesome!!
Hermosas!!
A+  The best running shoes
Asics Men's Gel-Cumulus 14 running shoe  Asics are always my shoe of choice. I'm on my feet at work all day and Asics are the only brand of shoe I've found that don't absolutely kill my feet. I will continue to buy and wear Asics as long as they give me foot relief.
excellent
Good running sneaker for neutral runner, at a great price while they're still around  Value:  I bought these running sneakers discounted since the newer Wave Rider models are out.  For my needs, I was buying primarily for functionality (fashion/design was not a critical requirement)  Use:  Primary use for them is triathlon training and races.  Fit:  I have slightly wide feet, but not enough to warrant ordering in "E" wide, a medium arch, and run neutral.  These shoes have been comfortable for my needs.  These have had sufficient room laterally to so that I don't feel they are too tight.  Right out of the box they fit well.  I developed some blisters the very first time I ran on them, but since I don't like to wear socks this is normal for me.  I haven't had any problems since the initial run.  After ~ 100 miles on them they have not changed significantly in feel.  Look:  I guess the orange/black has grown on me :)  I didn't buy these for the fashion, so not an important condition.  Bottom Line:  Good running sneaker for neutral runner, at a great price while they're still around
Very comfortable
Great Shoe at a Great Price  Good quality running shoe.  I use this shoe on my treadmill, running outside or just going out for a walk. Its also priced well.
very good shoes for a heavy runner~~
Best trail runners ever.  The best trail-running shoe I've owned. I wear them most of the time through the Vermont winter. The GoreTex works as intended.
Perfect  Great shoe. Perfect support and cushion while walking around Disney World parks.
Great shoe.  Made it through marathon training.  I used one pair of these to do my marathon training and bought another pair to run the actual marathon (after breaking them in).  Durable shoe with lots of cushion and the weight is perfect.  Switched from Nike and now it feels like I am running on a wrestling pad there is so much comfort.
Always a good shoe
All good!!  Have purchased this brand and size for years....All good !!!
Can't wait to run the green bay Spartan race in these. Hoping a scout for the packers sees my lightening fast speed and signs me
confortly nice  great shoe for all day comfort, an on a nice day or a fan blowing these shoes breath an grab wet floors.
Greatest Shoe to walk this earth  Greatest shoe of all time. I never was able to run due to arch problems, back problems, knee pain and sore feet. I can do everything in these amazing shoes. These shoes literally wan't me to walk/run as much as possible. If you haven't tried MemoryTek shoes you need to now!
Great pair of shoes  Arrived quickly. Great pair of shoes.
favorite ASICS yet
Nice and confy my husband said. They fit well.
bought it for my husband and he ordered an extra...  He loves the way it feels
Excellent shoe  needed a new shoe after wearing brooks beast for a yr.  wearing them to accommodate for over-pronation and flat feet.  the brooks were wonderful but i was hoping i could move into similar support but less weight.  the hurricane claimed to be that answer and it seems to be true to me.  is meeting my needs.  love them. [they make me feel faster...and well supported...and i actually have posted my best times...and least soreness/discomfort ever...]  thks
perfect  Perfect
Really great running/ yoga shoes  Really great running/ yoga shoes! I usually wear a size 7 but for this pair, I got a 7.5. It fit just right! The width seems to run slightly small so make sure ya order the right size. Besides that, this is a really fantastic pair of shoes! :)
Good shoes! Comfortable and goodlooking
Good
Great fit  You always need to order either half or 1 size up with Asics. But i am familiar with the brand so we knew what size to get. Excellent Delivery as always
nice shoe
nice to play indoor soccer and also to wear casually  Classic shoe can't go wrong here, nice to play indoor soccer and also to wear casually.
Comfort and Style  These are a great value. I typically wear an EE width, the fabric is flexible enough to accommodate a wide foot. They're comfortable and look great. I bought these to keep in my gym bag but I now wear them pretty regularly. I would definitely purchase these again for the value.
Just right  This is my second pair of M770.  They fit well, wear well, and are just right for the activities I participate in.
Supportive and comfortable  I used to have 5.0s and to be honest, these are by far the most supportive and comfortable shoes I have had in a long time. Great for short or long runs.
They are great! The last shoes I bought were horrible and I love these. I can actually exercise now.
Got what I expected.
These Shoes ROCK!!!  I bought these for my first Sprint Spartan Race. I was somewhat skeptical because they seemed really light weight when I took them out of the box. I was also worried that I'd get blisters since I was not going to wear them before the race, but someone else had given them a positive review regarding no need to break them in, so I took the chance. I also bought some of the fancy socks that are supposed to keep you from getting blisters. I have to say the shoes were awesome during the race. They grip like nothing else I have ever worn. They're better than my hiking boots. I was running past others who did not have these shoes, watching them slip & slide. They also drain water incredibly well. As soon as you climb out of the mud pit, you can't tell that you're shoes are even wet - there's absolutely no "squish" when walking or running. You can bet that I'll be wearing them in my next race. 10/10
Great Shoe  love these very comfortable  n light need a few more pr
Ran in them twice comfortable shoe.  Were delivered a day early!!
Great to wear, soft foam works very well Fits well I like it
Would love to have a different color
Sauconys are Great  Been wearing Sauconys for years, tried other shoes, and Sauconys cannot be beat.  Had troubles finding the right model and size in stores and found that buying on Amazon was easier and at worst no more expensive.
All Great. Just as described.  A++++++  All Great. Just as described.  A++++++
whata great shoe
Fantastic Active Work Shoes.  I bought these shoes to wear for a bartending position at a resort which requires me to be on my feet all day whilst occasionally having to briskly run for quick supply grabs and these have worked better than I ever could have hoped  I haven't even needed to buy cushioning inserts! If you're looking at a job position which requires "minimal black-on-black footwear", then look no further.
i get compliments constantly on them.if you did one for each city marathon i would buy em.boston?!?
Great shoes for Pacific Northwest weather  I got these for my husband and he is very picky about shoes and he loves them.  They keep his feet dry in the Oregon wet weather and are very sturdy.
Little smaller
Love them.  Best running shoes I have ever owned.
Sweet  I love this shoe, I wish I could buy them in green, but this color is awesome.
Level 5  Level 5 need more but currently unavailable from last place I purchased as a share holder I want to purchase more RESTOCK PLEASE
Love it
My husband lives Merrel shoes and these fit great, look awesome  They're GRRRRRRREEEEAAAAAATT! My husband lives Merrel shoes and these fit great, look awesome, and were CHEAP. Perfect combo
Wore Them today very Stylish.......Thank You
New Balance quality, excellent price!  I am a loyal New Balance customer and have been for years.  I was a bit hesitant as most New Balance shoes are priced $55 and above.  These were priced lower, so I though they would be lower quality.  NOT!  These are consistent with the New Balance quality I was expecting.  They fit as expected!  I purchased the same size as my other pair of New Balance shoes that are 5+ years old.  Excellent price!
It is a great shoe. Probably my favorite of all time  It is a great shoe.  Probably my favorite of all time.  Though the color not my favorite, the style is.
As always, Brooks delievers the best!  I am amazed how Brooks always are as advertised. They make such a quality (not perfect) shoe and I can speak by experience. I now own 7 pair of their shoes. I work in a gym and I wear a different shoe each week and can honestly say my feet NEVER bother me at the end of a long day. They fit so well, and I have sold several of my clients on the benefits of owning Brooks shoes.
Best shoes out there  Most comfortable shoes Ive ever had. They are the only ones I buy.
Take your usual shoe size and go down one size  By far my favorite running shoe (whether it's trail or road). The fit is perfect for someone with narrower feet and the the stiffness is perfect for moderately aggressive trails. These are my go-to trail shoes on single track and double track. The sole is stiff enough in the front to keep the toes from bearing too much weight, and the heel holds the heel of the foot in well.
Wonderful shoe.  Great cushioning  Hard to find a better shoe.  Comfortable to wear right out the box and the fit is perfect.  Great cushioning along with excellent stability.  Asics Nimbus gets it right.
Bought these for my son... he loves them.
Good shoes! Just add 1/2 size to your normal shoe size  Good shoes if you want just a little extra padding over Merrell's 'barefoot' line of shoes.  Note: They run about 1/2 size smaller than usual. I've purchased 11 sized shoes from Merrell before. I had to buy 11.5 for this size.  Otherwise, good shoes!
These shoes look great and are so comfortable  These shoes look great and are so comfortable. I do a lot of walking and these running shoes do the trick. I highly recommend them.
Great shoe  This is my third pair of asics gel-pulse running shoes.  I use them for daily walking.  They are very comfortable and minimize or eliminate my plantar faciatis.  I like the light weight.  The only downside is that I get holes in top of shoe after about one year.  This was the lowest price.
the shoes are just fine very happy with them.
perfect fit.  Thanks, perfect fit.
Brooks Men's Ghost 9  I have some tendonitis and these shoes address this issue to perfection! They are very much worth the cost in quality, comfort, fit, and finish!!!  I now have two pair in different colors!
Bought these for my husband and he absolutely loves them. He says they are so comfortable. I consider myself lucky to have found these in his size (14). I wanted a wide width and took a chance on the medium width and they do fit. His reaction was so positive that I bought him 4 more pairs of different types. Hope the ones on order fit as well but I expect they will.
Excellent  Excellent running shoe, was having trouble with my arch with my previous shoe, and this shoe fixed the problem. Highly recommend!
B-Day gift from Boo and I love them.
wide feet  I have a wide foot and i am comfortable in this shoe. Great fit.
Awesome !  This is my second pair and I just love em.
Felt a little small in the toe box when I first got them but these are great shoes. Merrell keeps dropping the styles I buy before I need a replacement pair and I'm sure these will be no different. If you're used to minimalist shoes, these won't disappoint
Great shoes at a good price  The fir is exactly like I would expect Nike's to fit, (I order a 1/2 size smaller than I usually wear).  Comfortable, good looking, for sneakers.  Great shoe.
Like them a lot
Very comfortable  This running shoe is awesome. I'd buy again when my current pair has seen better days.
Fantastic hybrid between the Noosa Tri and the Nimbus type model that Asics makes. Great shoe
I love these shoes!  Great fit!
Great Shoes  My second pair of Salomons, great shoes.
USA  Thank god a shoe that made in the USA! Great shoe in hard to find sizes by workers that get paid more than $5.00 a day hear that Nike.
very nice product
Excellent pair of shoes  First pair of running shoes I bought that my girl actually loves. I sometimes forget I have them on the way they're so comfortable. Good shock-absorbent material and good air circulation.
perfect fit and you can wear them all day without any discomfort.
Great Shoes!  They were a little bit larger than I expected but still fit fairly well. They're comfortable and great to use when traveling as they can be packed very easily and not take up hardly any space. I mostly use them for leg day and my squats have improved vastly after switching to these shoes.
Love these shoes!
perfect fit  Shoe was a perfect fit, snug enough to stay in place during running and quick movements, but roomy enough to be comfortable for extended periods of time.  Good ankle stability and good cushion in the heel and mid-foot area.  Definitely would buy another pair.
Excellent Running Shoe!
My favorite shoes right now. I just ordered a third pair in case they stop making them any more.
Most comfortable shoes I have ever owned!  I was having terrible pain in my right foot due to over-pronation and just from wearing cheap shoes in general. After a few weeks of wearing these, my foot is pain free! And I'm a healthcare worker who is on their feet 12 hours straight-these shoes make it a breeze. And I get tons of compliments on these everywhere I go. Will definitely buy again!
so comfortable. great running shoe  these are amazing. I bought another pair before they are all discontinued for next years model.
Great Barefoot Alternative to the Toe Shoes  I had been looking for a minimalist/barefoot shoe for a while but didn't want to have the shoe form fitted to my toes. This one fit the bill perfectly. It has great air venting so my foot doesn't get too hot and doesn't have anywhere near the weight of my Saucony's.  I had looked at the New Balance version and liked that their toe box was a bit wider. But I got these over the New Balance for a couple of reasons:  1) Style and Color options. Merrell has quite the variety and has been making shoes like this for a while. 2) Front Rubber toe guard. The New Balance air venting goes all the way to the sole which would not protect the foot against toe stubs, cactus thorns, etc., if I were to take these things "off-roading". 3) Price. Normally only slightly less than the New Balance, Amazon gave me these for $65 instead of the usual $100. Great deal for an amazing shoe.  Cons: A bit harder to slip in and out of given its form fitting nature
Awesome trail sneakers.  I love them.  Will buy another pair.
Excellent Shoes  Best shoes I ever had. Confortable, great look. Just excellent shoes. Fit as expected.
Great light weight shoe with outstanding stability and cushioning!  The light weight Kayano has outstanding cushioning, especially in the fore foot area.  It also offers great stability and is a super shoe for longer runs.  I've run in Asics shoes for years, and these are my favorites.  Compared to other Asics models, this shoe does run about a half size small.
A little on the small side but very comfortable.
These are the BEST walking shoes I've ever purchased (previous Nike  This is my 4th pair of Aetrex - Apex X826M waling shoes. These are the BEST walking shoes I've ever purchased (previous Nike, Adidas, Rockport...).  Great fit, support, and very durable.  I put 850 - 1,000 fast walking miles on these shoes per year. They last through this and a couple months beyond.
Love the color, fits perfect!
Best shoes around  Awesome shoes
now my sisters son still walk with them very good shoes  My son was have them for one year ,now my sisters son still walk with them very good shoes
Durable and true to size.  My son tried them on in a store before purchasing them online. They were true to size. He has a narrow to medium wide foot and rather long toes.
ASICS Men's Gel Venture 5 Running Shoe,...  Great shoe thus far.  I usually go with New Balance trailrunners, but thought I would give the Asics a try.  They fit comfortably and seem pretty solid.  Great shoe at a great prices.  Thanks.
My son is happy with the shoes
Versatile Shoe  This shoe fit as expected and is comfortable to wear. I have used this shoe during weight training and light cardio work.
Cloud shoes  It is like walking on a cloud.
One of the great athelete shoes  A really great shoes, comfortable, really light, it's a great for walking and running, in a good look, recommended for all
Excellent shoe.
Super !!!! Really good ...
Exellent, Just how I thought!  Exellent,Just how I thought!
Amazing fit and great product!  As soon as I put these shoes on I loved them! They have amazing support and comfort. My brother recommended the brand to me and I will definitely be buying this brand again in the future. I don't particularly care for the color and style but it's more important for me to have a good product that will last a long time and I'll enjoying using. Great for me as I head on hiking adventures! Happy trails.
Great shoes!  Fit well, but I already had a pair so fitment wasn't a guess.  Great shoes!
These are my all time favorite shoes. High quality  These are my all time favorite shoes. High quality, great traction, quick laces, great support, great comfort, and look badass.
Very comfortable shoe and it fit perfectly  Very comfortable shoe and it fit perfectly. The colors came out exactly how they looked on screen and I would definitely recommend at this price.
... got them for my daughter and they fit her good and she likes them  I got them for my daughter and they fit her good and she likes them!
NB Hooray!!  I've purchased some version of this shoe for several years.  I've run at least 10 marathons in these shoes.  It's the best shoe in this price range on the market.
Fantastic! When I wore these for the first time during Zumba I couldn't believe how comfortable they were! I will keep buying these every time I need a new pair.
Great Shoes  I LOVE these shoes. Took me 3 tries to get the right size but totally worth it. For me they ran a little small. They are my daily wear... More comfortable than the Adrenaline GTS which I also purchased for running. I wasn't sure about spending that much on a pair of shoes but I have flat feet and wore out everything I own so it was time. I read that these are very good so I gave them a shot. I will not hesitate to buy Brooks again. They are light weight too.
excellent business
toebox happiness  Finally a zero drop shoe with some room in the toe box.  I used Hoka on my last marathon and while providing a cushy ride they are not roomy enough in the toebox and you end up losing toenails.  This shoe performs well for cross-fit utilization.  I wear 11-11.5 and bought an 11.5 from reading previous reviews.  They fit true to size, 11 would have been fine with the room in the toe box.
Great for the money  After a short break in period, these shoes fit comfortably during even my most strenuous workouts.
very good shoes!
Gotta have it  Nice shoe
Perfect fits, nice styles and affordable  Perfect fits  , nice styles and affordable,
Very comfortable!  Top of the line cushioned shoe! Wide toe box and surprisingly cushioned upper. Even cushioned outsole distribution from heel to toe. I would recommend to any runner or walker and has enough space for your own arch support if needed but this shoe provides great support for a neutral or supinator.
Wish I could buy them out  I love theses shoes. I will probably buy an extra pair just to keep for later. Coolest looking trail shoes I've owned and splendidly comfortable.
Best Shoe I've ever run in!  As an avid runner and Cross Country/Track coach I decided to train for my first marathon. As my mileage increased...so did my injuries (shin splints/knee pain). I finally went to a local specialty store. I tried a variety of shoes to address the problem. I tried the Mizuno Waverider 12 (shin splints no knee pain),  Nike Triax (shin splints, no knee pain), Brooks Glycerin7 (HORRIBLE knee pain and shin splints). I finally tried the Paramounts and my love of running has returned. I ran a 6 mile out of the box and not a single pain to be noticed. The front of the shoe seems a bit open and I experienced a "slight" rub on the left big toe but other than that the shoe is incredible. I've since put a few more miles on the shoe and I have had no shin splints or knee pain. I actually PR'd my 5k time by 77 seconds yesterday with these puppies. The breathability of this shoe is amazing. My feet feel cool. Initiallly I thought the shoe felt hard with a lack of cushioning but that subsided after the first mile. The lack of leg pains is a testament to how well the shoe performed for me. I am 6' tall and weigh 190 pounds with moderate over-pronation. These shoes are well worth the price. It is the best shoe I have ever run in and I am looking forward to my training once again. If you are looking for a stability shoe with flexibility...check these out. I'm hooked.
Toe box was wider than expected. I usually wear a wide but these were ok. Lots of miles with no problems. Knee and foot aches resolved after wearin for a week even though mileage increased. Expensive but if they last a year they will have been worth it.
Love them  I bought these for my husband and he absolutely loves them! They are a little big in the toe area, but otherwise perfect... Comfortable and breathable!
Great shoes.
Quality is good but consider its size  Great for hiking, I have not tired while i was using it. However I use US10 in Merrell, Adidas,etc but corner of this shoe is so thin, it is better to purchase smaller size.
Great
Excellent!
Fit as expected and comfortable.
Awesome shoe!
Very nice  Pretty good for a light running under 5 miles. The sole is soft, while the support is solid. Wish these could help reduce the damage in knees.
Great sneaker
I have gone through several pairs of these and I always like to have a set  By far my shoe. I have gone through several pairs of these and I always like to have a set.
Excellent Shoe  I love these shoes.  I have been an Asics fan for many years and have run in each of the Kinsei models since they first came out.  This is the third pair of the Kinsei 5's I have ordered this year as I carefully track my mileage and tend to replace my shoes when I hit about 500 miles or so.  Typically I "retire" them for non-tuning uses.  These fit true to size and are much lighter and much more comfortable than previous models the only down side to the Kinsei models is that they are quite a bit more expensive than other Asics models.  Amazon is a great place to buy them as they are about $50-75 less than a lot of the other major online running retailers out there.
my second pair and loved them.
Comfy  Husband loved the fit and style.
Love Salomon shoes.
Love new balance and their consistency in sizes  Love new balance and their consistency in sizes. Year after year I can buy a pair without ever seeing it in person and know that I'm getting a shoe that fits exactly as I expect. A++!
Good running shoes.
Great!  Great!
Great running shoe.
I'm very pleased with this purchase  I'm very pleased with this purchase. I have wide feet so these fit like a glove. It may feel weird a bit initially, but you'll see the difference once you drive your tush to the floor.
Great if you are hard on shoes.  My son has worn NB for several years. They are comfortable, look good, true to size,and are sturdy shoes. He is very hard on shoes and NB  holds up to the heavy use. I bought two pair for him. The price was very reasonable. They look good too. I would recommend these shoes.
Great Brooks shoe  Great Brooks shoe; got them for my husband these are the shoes he runs in. In addition they are a very sharp looking shoe.
Outstanding  I have been running for a long time and I already tried several brands and models in order to improve my performance, but, I can confirm this Asics is the best experience that I had
Perfect for dirt or trail Cross Country meets.  My son wore these all through his cross country season and didn't have any problems. The treads on the bottom front seem to be halfway worn away after running in around  3 mile races. Overall very comfortable and grippy.
very good product  I like it very much also i hope it will be very good Chanel to bay many equipment from your side thank you very much
Excellent shoes  Excellent shoes
... for people with plantar fasciitis and in need of good support. So far these have been great  Bought these shoes because of the high recommendations for people with plantar fasciitis and in need of good support. So far these have been great!
Perfect  Just perfect got three pair will be getting more threw time such a comfortable shoes!!!!
New balance NBX 980  Shoes arrived on time. True to size. True to picture. Would recommend shoes and shoe store to other people.
Asics Running Shoe  They look great and feel great on my feet.  Very comfortable and for the great price.  Very pleased that I made the purchase.

They are absolutely the best!!  This is about my 5th pair of Speedcross sneakers. They are absolutely the best!!
very comfortable!!!
Shoes were comfortable on a five mile run, good cushioning.
BUEN PRODUCTO  LOS TENNIS LLENARON MIS EXPECTATIVAS, DE BUENA APARIENCIA, CALIDAD, TERMINADO, RECOMENDABLE PARA LOS QUE LES GUSTA EL CALZADO DEPORTIVO O PARA TROTE.
Product is as advertised and fit was as expected  Great shoe. Fit was as I expected. No issues. Packaging was VG. Love the Navy color.
light with great support
I have highly problematic 74-year-old feet and these shoes help me walk normally. Any other shoes and I'm hobbling.  I own four pair and Altra provisions are the only shoes I can wear and walk normally. I'm a fan .
Great Shoes! I have 6 pair  I wasn't sure if I could wear these all day my 2nd day of having but put them on in the morning for the gym and wore them all day and into the night. Great Shoes! I have 6 pair, so far lol
Excellent shoes and fits perfect  Had Asics before but this is the first time buying online. Excellent shoes and fits perfect.
Great Shoe  Had to switch shoes from the Reebok Ziglite because there wasn't enough stability in that shoe.  This shoe is light enough to be in the same class as the barefoot designed shoes, but has enough structure to keep my foot where it's supposed to be.  Great Product!
Wear these & be Happy on hard surfaces.  Both my husband and I changed to Hoka. We both have knee problems/surgery and now we can finally walk on pavement without pain. Son who works in big hospital also wears and said that ALL the staff are starting to wear.
nice one nikola tesla
awesome shoes don't work in snow  awesome shoes dont work in snow...
Love them! Like walking on a cloud.
Awesome Shoes  I have always loved the way Asics Running Shoes make my feet feel.  These shoes are no exception.
These are good for long hikes  These are good for long hikes, the insole is removable doesn't bunch up. They have held up to being wet repeatedly.  I purchased these and a pair of the Gel Nimbus 15 at the same time and I like these (Gel Cumulus 15) much better.
VERY COMFORTABLE SHOE  THESE SHOES ARE GREAT! FITS PERFECT. LOVE THE PULL STRINGS. FEELS GOOD WHEN RUNNING IN THEM. ORDERED ANOTHER PAIR FOR A BACK UP.
Excellent Ergonomics And Comfort  Excellent shoes, I find the ergonomics and comfort really good.  First pair was just a slightly smaller than my usual fit, I ended up going up one half size.
Amazing shoe!!!!
No more raisin balls, thanks guys  These shoes make me feel 94 years old again!!  They cater to my strategically placed vericose veins and make walking like the first time I.....  Well you know the rest!!!
Comfort is best I've had  This shoe feels the best on my feet compared to any shoe I have owned.  Perfect fit all around.  Only down side is that I didn't realize that the top front is like an open webbing which I couldn't see by the photos - but It's OK; I wouldn't give them up.
Great running shoes for a great price
So far, excellent  Haven't put many miles on them, but they're comfortable. No joint pain. If everything continues, will buy again.
I love these shoes  I have had them for a couple years now and they are the most comfortable shoes i have ever owned.
Nice shoes  Wow. Very comfortable. Look good and seem well made. Good or your back.
Beautiful  Color really pops
... a friend for softball he says they are the best shoes he's ever had  Bought the shoes for a friend for softball he says they are the best shoes he's ever had...They are extremely comfortable and he will be buying many more
Super comfy and excellent fit  Very comfortable and securely fits. This shoe is a great improvement over my last running shoe and almost feels like my feet are massaged as I run.
Great gift  Got these as a gift for my nephew, he loves them.
Excellent training shoe for 5 to 15 K
My second pair for the money super comfy for a sneaker.
Dope  Dope
Thanks!
Great Neutral Shoe  This is my second pair and they fit amazingly well.  I needed a neutral shoe due to my orthotic inserts (corrected pronation with a high arch).  The inserts fit perfectly once I took out the factory inserts.  My pain has been reduced greatly. Very happy with this product.
Didn't fit me  I had high hopes for these shoes. Price, style, weight all good. In the end they were just too tight around my midfoot. My right foot is wider than my left. I might try half size up.
Tough Mudder tested  Just finished a Tough Mudder and the shoes worked perfect. Went trail running and hiking a couple times prior to the event and had no issues on the 11 mile trek through the mud. They never came loose or filled up w/ mud and provided great traction through out the coarse. Being submerged up to my knee and sticky mud it never felt like the shoe was going to slip off my foot. I couldn't have been more happy with the purchase. Clean up took a couple minutes with the hose and they look good as new. Draw string lace system works the same as the day I bought them. I highly recommend these shoes for similar events or just hiking through the hills
Gelly always  I keep buying the same type of tinny and they all fit the same and wear the same, great shoes.
light weight and comfortable and look great  I ordered these for my son, and he loves them!  They are true to size, light weight and comfortable and look great!
Great Pair Of Shoes!!
Favorite shoes!  I love these shoes. I gladly paid extra for these knowing what great shoes they are!
Love the one-piece upper  Love the one-piece upper. I'm built like a Neanderthal, and have feet to match. Best fitting running shoes I've ever owned. I can chase mastodon all day in them. Assuming they hang out within about a half marathon. Grazing. Or, browsing, as it were.
Perfect fit  Comfortable tennis shoes for my husband.
Nike 407641-100 Air Max  I previously had a pair of these Nike running shoes, and I was very satisfied with their style, performance, support, and appearance, therefore I chose to get another pair to replace them.  I received them in a timely manner from the merchant without any hassles.
Great fit !
Nice  Comfy
My hubby loves these! Very comfy
Awesome shoes, they look great and I get compliments on them at the gym. They feel like $100 shoes.
Great shoes  The running shoes are nice and comfortable. Thanks for everything
Awesome running shoes  Love the fit of the Asics Nimbus - I've tried other brands and I don't even know why I bother trying something else when I know Asics Nimbus is the right running shoe for my foot and stride type.
I run a lot and I only wear Saucony; these are so comfy!  I'm not a running pro but I do get in about 1000 miles a year. I've used just about every brand but when it comes to running on paved roads/paths, I stick with Saucony. These Kinvara's are light, supportive, breathable, and comfortable.  The only thing is that the Saucony brand runs small. I wear size 10 for just about every shoe but when I buy Saucony, I order 10.5.
Great product, arrived quickly
love it!  This is a great running shoe! I run 3-5 miles 3 times/week. Very comfortable! Very pleased!
excelente
They feel like slippers! So comfortable for walking.
Great shoe  Amazing shoe, great for real runners.
Best trail runners ever  These might be my favorite running shoes ever. (Too bad the cleats won't really work on pavement.) I do lots of trail running; these have great grip and good stability. Their best feature is that I can forget about them on my feet. I buy new running shoes 2-3 times per year, and often feel like I'm fighting them. These work great out of the box, fit great, feel great, make me happy to be on the trails.
Love these running shoes!
I had horrible leg fatigue  Oh my!!! This is my second pair in 3 months. They're an absolute game changer. I am at work 14-16 hrs a day. 6-7 days a week.on my feet all day.  They have changed my life for sure. I had horrible leg fatigue, calf issues and horrible arch support from Nike Air, Reebok etc. if you haven't tried a psi yet, you don't know foot comfort at this level. You'll thank me later. :)-
worth buying  The box it came in was not  even dented and got it pretty fast, it fit exactly how I figured it would.
Great fit!!!  I really like them. They look better than the picture and are comfortable. Great fit.
confortable and fast  I bough for my kid 11y, he used nike and after tried this adidas he is more confortable and fast at the field, those shoes has a perfect fit on feet, giving him better traction
Just my favorite sneakers  My absolute favorite sneaker - really comfortable.  And $12 less on Amazon than at the shoe store.  What's there not to like?
love these shoes  I had these same shoes in black, but they were wearing out. The price and color was right, so I bought them. perfect!
Comfortable  Fit nice, look nice, and feel very comfy
Cool shoe!  Very pleased with the fit & look of these shoes!
Asics shoes  great quality,and an exellent fit.amazon was the only site that had varous designs of these shoes. Im very satisfided,and i just ordered a nother pair.
comfort for daily use  These are very comfortable shoes for daily use. This has walked miles and miles with me.
Best trail shoe
Highly recommended if you are running trails or on the beach  Highly recommended if you are running trails or on the beach. They feel very comfortable and are quite lightweight, you might 1 or 2 days to completely break into them (feet accommodation). They are also stylish and for that price Adidas has done a great work. My first run test in them: 6.30 miles no pain. Not recommended on wet concrete or while it's raining, will get slippery! If you want to sprint in them I suggest heavy socks for extra padding inside
These are some of the best I've owned  Vivobarefoot is leading the way in the minimal shoe industry.  These are some of the best I've owned. I own quite a few Merrells also, and even though they are great, these Vivo's are better.  The toe box is perfect, allowing for maximal toe splay.  The sole allows for maximum sensation with the ground.  They hold up well too.  I run in these in addition to wearing them as casual shoes.
Montrail Men's mountain Masochist ll Trail Running  like the color easy to spot. The Fit and comfort was great. If you are a half size order next size up. Insoles cushioned feet in all the right places . I do a fare amount of trail running, the traction soles dig in nicely to the terrain . No plans on running a 100k so i think these shoes will hold up just fine for my needs. This Shoe breaths well. light weight. Price I felt was reasonable. I've seen other shoes that were comparable  but cost more. I would recommend the Montrail Mountain Masochist II Trail to anyone who wants to enjoy the outdoors.
Awesome Shoes  Great for running and they look good. Probably will get another pair.
Worth every penny  Love this shoe. Great buy.  True to size. Came right on time. Comfortable throughout my 5k walk
The One and Only  My husband will only wear these shoes.  Hope they never stop making them.
Fits great, very comfortable.
I love theses trial sneakers.
Very very comfortable and I love the style!
cool trail shoe  light weight, good construction, fits well without slipping, I run in the desert and the foot plate protects my feet from small to average rocks...worth the money
Great running shoe
no more shin splints
size mistake  I made a size mistake I need the same new balance 1906 but size 10(D)M. Can you change and charge the difference. Thanks
Sweet shoes.
These are probably the best d*** shoes I have ever bought  These are probably the best d*** shoes I have ever bought , I will probably buy these for the next rest of my life .
Boost where you need it!!  IMHO these are the perfect blend of older rubber technology for agility and renounce. The new boost technology in the back is good for dampening and cushion on the heel. The black on the outside of the bottom is a bit weird and not seen on any other model from Adidas. I got these off Adidas website for $60 and at that price these shoes are a good deal. I would not pay $100 for these shoes, you're better off getting a full-length boost model if you need additional comfort.
Great running shoes.
Beast Replacement  I bought these for walking/work, as I'm on my feet a lot, and have a bum ankle (sinus tarsi syndrome). I've worn 4 Generations of what is arguably the best running support shoe made, in the Brooks Beast; however, they ruined the latest version of that show (Beast 16) by moving away from the sock liner. So far I'm loving the support w/cushion in the Wave Horizon a lot!  I run in the Wave Inspire, and give them high praise for comfort and durability, so hopefully these will do the same.
As expected  Been using these for some time now. Didn't realize they were made in China, for as much as I run I guess they hold up.
Great shoes!  This is only my second pair of Salomon shoes.  They're great!  They fit well, are super supportive, and are very comfortable.  Great shoes!
The selling make good on my last purchase
Nice Shoes  Nice shoes and they were exactly what I expected! I love wearing Vibram FiveFingers!!!
Beautiful
Really Nice Sneaks !  I totally Love this Puma Sneaker and was really bummed out when I had to return it. But Note it had absolutely Nothing to do with the Sneaker itself, the Sneaker was just Too Small. I Ordered the size I normally get, but this Puma definitely was to snug for my liking. Maybe if I wore it for a couple months it would stretch to my liking, but I do Not have the time to be wearing a Uncomfortable Shoe just to stretch it. But as I mentioned, the Sneaker itself is awesome. Just keep in mind that I personally believe that Puma runs a tad bit small. (thru past experience I found this out). So for a quick example....if you are say a 10.5.....my Reco would be to Order a 11. With a good pair of Socks it will fit just fine.
Seems solid for weightlifting and the short runs I've gone on. Too early to comment on durability.
Great value  I miss plain old running shoes.  Nowadays it seems like whenever I go to buy a pair, all I can find are "minimalist" shoes which offer little to no arch support.  Maybe I'm in the minority but I really have no desire to wear neon colored foot gloves.  I liked my basic, neutral running shoes the way they always were - solid and supportive.  As a person with "difficult feet" I have to spend entirely too much time hunting to find something that works and it's frustrating.  So here we have this new model from Asics, which offers a more traditional design with some modern updates.  Like a minimalist shoe this one is lightweight and snug.  However, like my favorite running shoes of old, this model also has a firm arch (check that silver arch plug that keeps it from bending in the wrong places) as well as solid springy cushioning.  It's also got a removable insole which allows an aftermarket arch support to slide in neatly.  The material breathes well too.  Plus - for those of us in the over-35 category - the colors are subtle and basic.  No neon!  For the price - and these are very reasonably priced - I haven't found a better buy.  If you are looking for a basic neutral running shoe that supports your feet and looks like something an adult would wear, look no further.  Good job, Asics.
Great shoes
My son really likes these shoes. He's a young teenager with size 14 Wide feet. Can't buy shoes for him locally.
Comfortable - runs large  The shoes are very comfortable but they run about 1/2  to 1 size larger than I usually wear in other brands.
Good and fit
As expected  The shoes fits nicely on my feet. The price tag was cheap but the quality isn't cheap at all. Looks very durable. Feels very comfortable running in them. Thanks.
Value plus performance  Good value.  Performs as well as the Asics $120 plus shoes
1st Ultra!!  Great!! Order arrived on time, and use these on my 1st Ultra Marathon.  Very comfortable!!
I love itmaybe my foot a little fat, so the shoes is a little narrow.
Fits good
Fit great
Great running/walking shoe  This is a great running/walking shoe. Comfortable and good support
Very comfortable and sturdy with lots of cushion.
Great pair of work shoes for humid environments!!  Absolute relief. Shoes allow feet to breathe while providing comfort. Cushioned insoles are amazing!
EXCELLENT  Perfect running shoe at discounted price!
Great fit and quality
Great deal  The shoes are awesome. I am a big fan of new balance shoes line!! And this model are just great
Great Shoes  Great Shoes these are good shoes for all around out-doors activities.
Happiness for my feet!  Great shoes!  With a little thinner sock they are very comfortable!  Clean, sleek look!
These are the perfect shoes for him  My husband has the flattest and widest feet known to man. These are the perfect shoes for him! Extremely pleased!
Very goods shoes.
As expected
After years of ordering the same shoe, the same size shoe I was struggling to have them fit correctly. Finally divided to go up in width and now they fit perfectly. Not sure if it is my foot that changed or the shoes.
Best kept secret  Extremely comfortable! !!!!
Perfect running shoe  Been with Vomeros since version 7, rate them as a very supportive neutral running shoe, wouldn't think of wearing any other shoe for running!
These shoes saved my health had problems walking till I got these
One of my favorite pairs of NB's. Real comfortable.
These pureflow are the best. Tried others  These pureflow are the best. Tried others, but Brooks seems to change them so they have never fit quite right. But the pureflow 4 have been always able fit. The seller also shipped these to me immediately and I got them several days ahead of schedule!
Perfect and shipped quickly
Genil  Genial
Nice shoes look great  Nice shoes look great. The shoes came with a gel sole inserts that makes the shoes very comfortable to wear.
Great sneakers
love them!  i bought these for my husband and he loves them.  he has other pair of these in a different color and loves them too.  :)
These are the most comfortable shoes. Will definitely buy again  These shoes run a size small but I was already aware of this prior to buying them.  These are the most comfortable shoes. Will definitely buy again.
Great  These were just as advertised and very comfortable. Light weight and fit perfect. I would deffenatly recommend them. Great to run or as casual shoe. Look and feel amazing.
Colors brighter than expected.  More fluorescent than expected but still a great looking shoe!
Great Fit, great buy!  Extremely comfortable.
Everything ok.
best shoes  shoes fit perfectly and are uber comfy. you simply can't beat merrell shoes. i recently became a convert to them and wished i had done so sooner.
Love them. Great shoes
Nice!
Skechers run wide which is great for 6 toed people with wide feet
good  good
Replaced Brooks Pureflow4  Replaced my Brooks Pureflow4, since Brooks totally dropped the ball on the Pureflow5. I was so glad I tried these since I couldn't find the PF4 in my size anymore. Asics 33-FA is my new shoe, after running in Brooks Pureflows for the past 5+ years.  Super plush ride without being too soft, responsive, and very breathable uppers. I've run about 50 miles in them so far, the longest run being 12 miles no issues at all. Go a half size larger as most reviewers recommend and you're good. Going to buy a couple of more pairs, at this price you can't go wrong
Great so far, will update if there are any issues.  The shoes have good support and really have good impact cushioning.  I've only gone on one run with them but expect many more.  Will update the review if there are any issues.
Nice comfortable shoes!  Nice comfortable shoes!  New Balance calls them a "trail shoe" but I wear them for everyday.  They are comfortable and provide nice support.  The top is breathable so my feet do not get too hot. I would buy these again.
Outstanding quality and finish  I am very happy withy these shoes, but they will fit a bit tighter, so I have to buy a full size larger than usual.  Otherwise, the quality and finish is first class.
Went through 2 pairs of the clifton 2's and loved them except the width. The 3's are perfect.
Great shoes  I train in Nike Pegasus' for years. After blowing through 2 pairs due to failing quality issues with the Nikes, I decide to give the Mizuno a try. I love the ride, and the fit. Very similar to my old Nike favorites, but better (they look cool too). Worth the extra bucks.
... so I don't feel the strain on achilles tendon like so many running shoes do to me  I was skeptical when ordering yet when they arrived and I tried them out I found them to give me just the support I need so I don't feel the strain on achilles tendon like so many running shoes do to me.
Good shoe. Comfortable and stylish  Good shoe.  Comfortable and stylish.  Get a lot of complements on them.
Asics are solid!!  Perfect shoe by Asics every time. They fit well and I have beer had a problem with them ever. Thanks!
Great shoes  Three middle distance runs in and I can say they are great so far and feel as though they'll last a long time. I purchased these based off of runner's world's editor's choice and they seem to live up to the review they gave.
Awesome shoes!  I owned a pair of these many years ago. These fit exactly as I remember. Very comfortable, stylish, and durable. I came back and bought a second pair from Amazon in a different color.
My son like his shoes he only wear new balance. Because he wear a 7 1/2. 4E
10/10  i love these shoes, they fit so perfect and they so so comfortable. i use them at work and gym. they are one of the best shoes of their kind out there.
Excellent shoes
Great shoes seller was great assure to look at seller site great person and fair  Shoes still looks good a deal easy to clean
I like these 574's a lot!  These are great! I find all 574's fit a little tight. I usually wear an 11.5 D, but buy these in a 12 D. Great comfort and style.
Nothing like New Balance  Your feet are happy and comfy all day long..
Great fabric
Nice looking shoe  I bought them for a friend and he loved them - it is the school colors and very sharp looking!
These are great shoes - prescribed by my Podiatrist for use with my flat feet and used with prescription custom molded inserts  These are great shoes - prescribed by my Podiatrist for use with my flat feet and used with prescription custom molded inserts. Do yourself a big favor - if you have flat feet get into a podiatrist and get custom arch supports at an early age. I didn't and am now paying the price. Don't use the stock or off-the-shelf insoles if you have flat feet.  These shoes are great! If you get insoles done you will likely need to add 1/2 to one size up in length and 1 width jump up.
I made a mistake about the size  Ill return it and you will send me the (US9 - UK8) one. It is a very good shoe and Ill join it. Im sorry for the inconvinience.
Very Comfortable Running Shoe  As a former runner getting back into running after a couple knee surgeries have prevented me from running for about two years, I wanted to get an affordable shoe that is also comfortable. After hearing from my physical therapist to try Brooks, I went to the local sporting goods store and tried on a pair. I fell in love with the comfort immediately. The gel used in the sole of this shoe is so natural and comfortable that it feels better than walking around barefoot. I would highly recommend giving these shoes a try.
Good Buy!  Light, comfortable and reasonably priced!!
Great shoe, no knee pain  I quit jogging a few years ago due to left knee pain. Kept walking and using other aerobic exercise but always enjoyed jogging. Thinking maybe getting a real good cushion and support shoe might get jogging again I purchased these after doing some research. So far I have no pain during or after jogs. Cushion very nicely but don't feel wishy-washy. Hope this continues.
Perfect fit like it
This shoes has a wider toe box than most (which works great for my wide feet) and holds up well through 100's of miles.  A great training shoe.
Good
Favorite shoes!  The 1080 line has to be one of the best New Balance has put out. Great all around neutral shoe.  Amazing cushioning and fit.
Love these shoes I'm a teacher and I got the tobacco oiled it was the right color for my wardrobe
Excellent running shoe  Thank you Runner's World for leading me to this running shoe.  I bought it sight unseen, something I rarely do with running shoes, but the shoe has outperformed my expectations.  I just completed my first ever 5k run (62 yrs old), and the shoes provided the cushioning, comfort for my tired feet the whole distance.  Visit the Saucony site for more technical details on the shoe, but please accept this unsolicited endorsement for the shoe.  Presently, I am looking to order a 2nd pair as the sole is starting to show some wear and tear.
I didn't buy this show for running. I actually got it for its looks for casual wear. It's a very good looking shoe and feels good on feet with decent cushioning.
good  I like it so you can buy one ,my friend also think it is very cool,I feel good ,I will go to China for two mouth
True to size  They fit true to size, best pair of asics that I have ever owned. Comparing the size with the nikes, they fit just about the same.
Great shoes
Great running shoes with 4mm drop.
Second pair
Great shoe very comfy increased my speed running and distance by about 3%
Great shoes. Been being them for years and never disappointed.
I really loved the Ride 7's and these are right up there  My go to shoes. I really loved the  Ride 7's and these are right up there. Super comfortable, good support.
Very comfortable.
Excellent
Very nice running shoes
Nice and comfortable.  Great shoes. Fits as expected and provide all day comfort to a very energetic kid. Will definitely buy them again and again.
Great Fit and Super Comfy  I run 5k, three times a week, mostly on a cemented track and sometimes on trail like surface. these shoes are really comfy and and true to size. initially i was skeptical with all the fancy zig zaggy sole, but whatever it is - it makes the run more comfortable and less stressful on my knees than the Addidas i had before ! give it a try !
Best shoe I own  Practically weightless, comfortable, keeps my stride aligned correctly.  This is my first pair of Asics shoes in about five years and I don't know why I bought anything else.  I'm buying another Asics model today as a backup since my theory is that all shoes hurt you if you run enough, but different shoes hurt you differently.  I'm now rotating among four pairs, but I keep wearing these Asics.
Favorite shoes of my son :)  My son just loved them! He had the same shoes before, in black and green. The fit is "true to size" but he likes the shoes a little bigger. The colors are great; I was concerned about the real look since computer pics can be deceiving.
Love the blue.  My son loves the color and the memory foam.
Price  Great fit for the price.
My husband loved them. So comfy.
I wear a Double E in Width so finding running shoes is always a hassle but once these pumps get broken in they are the most comfortable running shoes i have ever had loving both sets i have picked up.
Walking on clouds  The most comfortable work shoes that you can get. I have poor circulation and plantar fascists. These shoes are great.
Very comfortable.  This shoe runs a little small and a little tight.  Order a half size longer and wider. I ordered 13 eeee and it was still a bit short and the width was just right despite not having ultra wide feet.  That said, this is a very comfortable and "cushy" shoe.  I am 6'5" and 240 and this shoe is far and away the most cushioning running shoe I've ever worn.  New Balance has such a large selection of wide widths that I've simply given up bothering with any other manufacturer.  I've owned many pairs for many years and I continue to be impressed.  I think the 1224 is the best fitting running shoe I've ever worn and I'll be buying several pairs.
Great inexpensive running shoes. They fit my feet perfectly
Excelente!  Excelente!
A great pair of shoes.
Great Shoe!  Great product! Do not wear without socks though... I got massive blisters.  Aside from the false advertising stating that these are okay to run barefoot in, this is exactly what I wanted.
well made  neat product
Excellent shoes  Received my shoes several days ago. The fit is great, feels good walking in them.
Perfect fit  These are the shoes I have been waiting to find!! Everything about them ticks all of the boxes that I have been looking for in a zero drop shoe. Now I just need to get some more!
Great shoe to run in. Reebok is definitley stepping up their shoe game  Sneakers a great and comfortable. I run and walk in them and the have a lot of cushion and comfort.
All was good.  Nothing.  All was good.
Great training shoes  They are perfect for running, fit as expected and good looking, very comfortable and really good price! Thank you! A
As expected.
Great shoes
Best... I've EVER found&worn  Diabetic neuropathy, with years of foot pain ... NO MORE !!! Wicked Good shoes; For the medically challenged ...
Great trail shoe.  Love the show very comfortable. One think I like is the black lower sole does not show dirt and stains like the more typical white ones. The only negative is the strings are a bit long. Wear on our paved neighborhood trail not show how would do in the woods.
I like them and they met my expectations  Have two pairs...running trail runs in San Diego East County.....so far, no negative events occured that was the fault of the shoes.....usally it was me making mistakes.....I like them and they met my expectations.......to give readers the trail terrain I used them in, ran Iron Mountain and other trails in San Diego, rocks, gravel, and loose dirt up/down....can't find any negative comments thus far....
