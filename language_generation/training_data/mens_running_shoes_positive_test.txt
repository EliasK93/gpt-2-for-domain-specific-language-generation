Quick delivery and quite comfy
You get a good shoe if you can afford the price.  I like the combination of support/padding while also staying light-weight. My only quip is they lose their "fresh" look really fast. Worth the coin in my opinion.
great product  great product and quality only adidas can offer your fans. the sending was done so quickly and arrived in the estimated time
Perfect
Awesome shoes for running  These shoes are super flexible and very lightweight and there is plenty of ventilation for air to get into your shoe.  I suspect that rain and cold would get in as to be suspected.  No experience with that yet. Nice to run in.
Good quality  The sandal is very comfortable. I ordered a 39W, and it's too wide. I returned it and reordered a 39N. good quality
Very comfortable.  Just what we wanted. Very comfortable.
Decent buy.
comfortable durable have had for over a year hold up great.  Shoes are great for crosstraining and shorter runs 3 miles or so
Excellent cushioning, good fit, very comfortable
Happy Customer  My Husband Loved them!.
Flat footed husband....  My husband really needs motion control shoes.  Had one pair of these and wore them out.  Great support and balance for the flat footed.  So glad we found these.  Have been trying to find the right tennis shoes for years.  Have had way more expensive shoes but none as good as these.
Runners..if you hate the typical shoes sold in the store this is the shoe for you  I hate nike, brooks, and a lot of other typical brands for running shoes. They all look the same, and blend together in a bunch of BLAH. I love mitzuno's for their great color, and vibrant look. I always get compliments on these running shoes..oh and by the way not only do they look great ..they are the best running shoes ever. I have wide feet, and these fit me fine with no issues.  They are light, and provide lots of air especially on those long cardio days where you are sweating like a whore in church.  I will never buy another brand of running shoes again. I am now a strictly Mitzuno man.
Nice  light and comfortable
Hurt Achilles  Just like Nimbus 15, they hurt my Achilles tendon (mostly from pressure while driving and sitting so not sure if running-only would hurt). Otherwise a  great shoe.  I'll have to research comparable brand's styles for those of us that run on the outsides of our feet.  Update: The tendon issue resolved when I added a insert pad. Great shoe. Hope '18's are the same.
verry good for gym. I been using asics snekers,i had frackture  spinalcore so is give me the suport went i work out.
good advice  My size actually is 9.5D, but I ordered 10D for this product. It is because I saw another website recommending to order a half size up for New Balance shoes. That's why it fits me as expected. I really appreciated that information I found elsewhere. By the way the direct road-feel you get from the Minimus in walking(in my case) translates nicely into an immediate pedal-feel if you own a car with manual transmission. With an accurate pedal-feel like this you might enjoy shifting gears manually even in a traffic jam.
GREAT SHOES.
Great walking shoes  Husband loves these for work since he has to walk a lot.
Great fit extremely comfortable
perfect for running.  Awesome shoes
good enough
I love these shoes it fits as expected and very light!!
My hubby loves this shoe
Best OCR shoes I've had... Best all around trail shoes I've had...  I've been in search of great, not good, OCR shoes since my Inov8 285s bit the dust eariler this year.  Had Inov8 continued producing the Roclite 285s I would have purchased another pair of those.  I tried a pair of Icebug Zeals.  They are fantastic shoes and would have been my choice, but they are just a tad too narrow.  Fine for short distances, but hell on my feet for anything over 5 miles.  If they had fit I may have never found the Mutants.  So glad the Icebugs didn't fit.  I bought the Mutants on a lark, having had a pair of La Sportiva Wildcats for a few years that I used solely for backpacking.  My experience with La Sportiva shoes has been great so I gave the Mutants a shot.  The Mutants are pretty light for the size of the shoes.  They do not look anything like minimalist shoes, but they don't weigh much more than minimalists.  The lug pattern on the sole is very aggressive, and the shoes seem to be built for off trail use only, but they are surprisingly very comfortable and as responsive on dry, hardpacked trails as they are in the mud and goo.  The unique tongue and lacing system are like nothing I've ever seen or tried before, but they work to really hug your foot into the shoe.  Compared to the other La Sportiva shoes I own, these are a tad narrower, but not so narrow that they become uncomfortable over long distances.  I wore these shoes on multiple training runs in preparation for the 2015 Spartan Race Beast at Killington, Vermont.  I had zero issues with chafing or blisters on any run, including when the shoes were brand new out of the box.  I trained in varying conditions from dry to deep, heavy mud, and never slipped in these shoes.  At Killington, these shoes proved that they belong on the list of great OCR shoes.  I was able to navigate technical off-trail descents MUCH faster than I was ever able to in my Inov8s.  I think that was due to both the upper style (tonges and lacing) and the aggressive tread.  Depending on the soil, the treads would hold a little mud when traversing long mud fields, but a quick flick of the ankle would remove the mud.  On wet foliage, the shoes felt glued in to the ground.  In all of the steps I took on the mountain I had zero slips.  I would recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a great shoe for OCRs or for trail/off trail running.
Sweet shoes!  I have to stand on concrete during my work hours, and these helped my feet tremendously. It's like night and day. I highly recommend them to anyone who has to stand on concrete for a good amount of the day. My feet hardly feel sore after 8 hours. These shoes offer great support for me since i'm flat footed as well.
A good shoe at a good price.
Amazing lifting shoes  Amazing shoe for wider feet. I generally wear a 9.5 - 10 wide, so I got this in 9.5 and it fits perfectly.  The toe is a little flexible for more dynamic moves, while the heel is solid for heavy lifts. It definitely helped improve my ability to deep squat and provides an excellent platform for squats
comfortable and good for running
GREAT!  I already bought another pair!
Great Running Shoe, Highly recommend  I am currently in the US Army assigned to an Airborne unit.  We run often and for long distances.  The first time I wore these was on a 6-7 mile run, on pavement, gravel, and dirt roads.  They were very comfortable, light, and provided good protection against items in the road.  My feet feel great and I will use these for as long as they make them.  I highly recommend these if you run for long distances and run on various types of terrain.
Great shoes!
Whee!  Big red shoes for my big flappy feet!
Very comfortable to walk with  Fit as expected. Very comfortable to walk with.
Comfortable shoe for walking  My first pair of these shoes is starting to wear out so it's time for a new pair.  These shoes fit great and are very comfortable walking shoes.
Great Shoe  Love New Balance shoes. I have been using them for their box type tow and wide sizes forever.
I LOVE Vibram shoes  I LOVE Vibram shoes. I own 4 different pairs of Vibrams and each one is equally as awesome as the others. I bought this one more specifically for the gym because its sole would allow me easier movement while doing leg workouts from squatting to even calf raises. I love the color of this pair, it's a nice red color with the light reflector lines( that look like spider webs haha). They have lasted me through everything from the gym to even hiking (when i was out of town and only had these with me) and anything in between. They finally got tears in them after having them for a long while and using them extensively. I will definitely buy these again, and again...and again. haha!
Positively surprised  I needed a new running shoe for muddy, outdoor trails.  The last one I had for this purpose was the Saucony Razor, which had a similar design as this one.  Whatever Saucony has redesigned in the Xodus 2.0 makes it much more comfortable than the Xodus "1.0" or the Razor.  This shoe comes highly recommended. It is a bit hot in the summer but very comfortable.
GOOD  GOOD
Love the Merrell shoes.  I started the transformation to minimal running a couple of years ago and have really enjoyed running in Merrell shoes.  Ran my last marathon in Merrell  sand set a pr by over 15 minutes. They take a little get in used to but are so worth it.
LOVE!
Does what it is supposed to do.
They fit great and feel good when you run, also very light weight
Super shoe  Brilliant shoe. Looks great, feels light!
Comfortable, cute and light weight. I love them
Awesomeness  Awesome wish the whole japanese connection were available
Original Hoka Clifton was so much better than the 2nd version.  So excited to find the original.
Classic style and comfort
Perfect!
Get 1/2 size larger   Great shoes. Usually wear size 8 but 8.5 fits. Free returns so no big deal. Really good job manufacturing these shoes. Seems some Chinese producers are really stepping up their game! Great shoes.
