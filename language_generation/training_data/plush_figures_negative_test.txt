Very small  The product is ok just very small .... I didn't return because was a bday gift....
As expected.
Over-priced and Over-rated!  We have owned this Elmo for 9+ months now. Elmo has been TURNED OFF for nearly 6 months now.  This Elmo is merely a timed response product. You simply program your child's name, favorite food and drink and nap/bed-times and a few favorite songs from a narrow list. During the day, elmo will alert your child of meals and naptimes.  There isn't much versatility to the programming of meals or drinks. And if the timer is off (say, the battery is running low) Elmo will likely awake your child for snack during naptime or threatening a naptime during dinner! This explains why our Elmo has been placed in the penalty box for so long.  I hesitated to write a response expressing my disappointment since I also bought this as a gift for several people before trying it for myself, er, my son.  The bottom line:  This product was such a dispappointment. For $50, the product should do more and come with a few blinking lights for more stimulation. Maybe if it were a bit more similar to Baby Tad or The Fisher Price Laugh and Learn Puppy, I might be a little more satisfied with this purchase. For even half the price, you can invest in an elmo that will shout or jump or do the hokey pokey.
Don't know if this is user error or poorly made product  We got this in the mail today & my 20 month old was ecstatic to see Elmo. He has an Elmo potty book so he kind of understood the concept until I unwrapped it and got him to drink then immediately pulled Elmo's pants down & put him on the toilet...I couldn't have been faster & we still got the accident song. We did this about 5 times & we only got the yay he went to the potty song once. Wanted to look at the other reviews b4 deciding if I was going to send back & possibly get the more expensive model
It's to hard for my child to find the button in his tummy to make him talk...My child played with it twice since I bought it...I was a waist of money for me.
A waste of money  :(  It's too hard for my 2 year old to change the hats himself. It's even hard for me, to be honest. Elmo says the same few phrases per hat, it's super repetitive.  And no volume control. Ugh. But since my son barely touches it, it's not a big deal I guess.
Not the round eye Stitch like the picture.  I sent an email to be assured it was Stitch with the round eyes. Order arrived and it was the new Stitch expression - mad or angry eyes. Sent an email to see how the customer will be handled this. Will update once I get a response.  Really disappointed since most reviewers seemed to get what the image shows.
I expected a official funko plush but instead I got a bootleg.
Not as pictured, certainly not up to my expectations  This toy was intended for a newborn boy.  The picture leads the buyer to assume they are receiving 3 cats.  No.  What you receive is one scrawny cat unfit for a pet crib.  I'm horribly disappointed. I feel totally duped and $13 tossed into the wind.
Scratchy fur  This guy looked so cute in the picture, but when I finally got him I was disappointed. Mainly because the fur has sparkles sewn into it which makes it really scratchy and cheap looking and feeling, and also it just wasn't as nice quality as I was expecting. The Aurora sweet and softer hedgehog is similar but a lot nicer and softer.
Plays fine. But is very flimsy and smashed!
Great price but poor quality!  For the price its a great purchase but just look cheap and can easily rip apart if kids was to toss it around.
Weird music, Velcro won't close.  The music is weird, nothing like the one I had for my daughter. The music box is too big so the velcro in the back won't close. It came with no packaging.... I'm very annoyed by this purchase!
It didn't have glasses or a newspaper.  It didn't have glasses or a newspaper. My son wanted a "newspaper zombie" it was just a plain old zombie
Dissappointed!  This White lion is not made well. I am very dissappointed. Mine is crocked and will not stay up straight. Keeping it because it would cost more to send back.
Fake - peas are rotten!  The item I received was not as pictured.  When shopping for this item, I noticed there were two varieties: one looked like the cute Disney GREEN peas, the other looked like a cheap, yellow knock-off  I particularly chose this item based on the picture: cute green peas in a polka dot bag.  I received the cheap, yellow variety.  Also, to mention, the Seller was named "Disney", but there are no Disney tags on these items- I am sure these are fake.  Very disappointed.  I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing, because others this year seem to have the same experience.
I was going to place an order when I saw the elephant at $7. Price has doubled and it is absolutely ridiculous.
adorable but Not suitable for babies  I love this character. And my 3 mo old daughter loves Elmo too. She likes to bit Elmo's nose. The next day, I found that her little hands are full of red fur.  Mummies, be aware! It might be choke ur little ones. I think this toy is not suitable for babies! Maybe I will give it after she turn into 1 yr old.
Poorly made...  I'm giving it 2 stars because it IS very soft but it is so poorly stitched together it's ridiculous! I've already had to sew back up 3 holes where it's neck was coming undone & 2 on the hind end. Can't believe I spent so much money on this poorly made thing. My son does love it though so I guess I'll just keep my needle & thread handy...
okay  The mustache was coming off and his nose looked nothing like it does in the picture! His nose is so so long I thought it was Pinocchio in a mario suit
Do not order this!! You will never get it  waste of money
Smaller than it should be!! Hard, not cuddly.  Smaller than the real ones!! My MIL bought this same glow worm in the store by her and after 1.5 yrs of use it stopped glowing.  My little one LOVES the glow worm to cuddle and sleep with, so when it played music but stopped glowing, it was rough and I immediately ordered this replacement. However, I was disappointed to see that even though it physically looks the same, it is about 25% smaller than the one we have. As a result theres almost no cushion. Its like hugging just the battery box. Luckily I was able to remove the glow compartment in this one (which is the same size) and just change that out with the one we have. I would not buy this otherwise.  Get them in the stores instead.
Facial features do not line up. Half of his face is about .5 inch lower than the other side.
Sailor duck Nuby singing toys.  Both the toys bought stopped working within the first couple of days. These were the sailor ducks. Previous toys that I bought sometime ago are still working, so I was very disappointed to say the least and am now rather wary of buying any more.
DO NOT BUY FROM BeBOOM Toys & Gifts!!!  FAKE, CHEAP RIP OFF ITEMS!  This review is for the purchase of Despicable Me Unicorn 12" Fluffy Plush Unicorn SOLD BY BeBoom Toys & Gifts.  DO NOT PURCHASE!  You will not be getting the item you see in the picture.  What you will get is a FAR inferior cheap Chinese rip off item.  All these types of toys come from China, but there's a difference between the toys that the license holder authorizes to have their name on and the cheap knock off items that some people get tricked into purchasing with false item pictures!  After talking to Amazon, they are stepping up to the plate and replacing this item for me for free with 1 day shipping, to get it here before Christmas!  Their rep explained to me that 3rd party sellers are supposed to be fulfilling the items for the exact item pictured, but that doesn't always happen.  These types of sellers are ripping off consumers and leaving them with a bad Amazon experience.  Again, to Amazon's credit, they fixed a problem they didn't cause and because of that I will remain a loyal Amazon Prime customer!  Please...if anyone who's reading this is considering making a purchase and the fulfilling seller is BeBoom Toys....DO NOT PURCHASE!  You will be getting ripped off!
Black Yoshi  I am very disappointed in this item.  While it was delivered in a timely manner, it's falling apart. We've had it for 2 weeks, and when we opened it up we saw that the seam on Yoshi's back was already coming undone.  There is a seam underneath him that is also coming undone.  I would have returned it, but because it was so cheap, we really didn't see the point.
Bad
Not impressed.  I don't think this will hold up very well for my 7 year old. I bent one of his legs and his head turned. And, he only has 4 misshapen finger on each hand... Unfortunately I removed the tag before I paid much attention.
Very disappointing!! My son was only able to use one time as water got in it. Definitely not waterproof!! Would not buy!!
My 5 year old daughter asked for this for Christmas so I ordered it and just recently received it.  So disappointed!  It doesn't show you that on the left foot I reads 'baby's first Christmas.' So annoying!  BEWARE!
Unstable  The center of gravity causes the unicorn to fall over toward the head.  Very difficult for small children to keep unicorn on all fours.  Poor design.  Also, not very soft.  Not worth the price.
The toy came in a dirty plastic bag  The toy came in a dirty plastic bag.  Luckily, the toy did not get dirty.  I had to change bags because it was a gift.
This item is not as pictured.
It had a rip in the seam.
Small and unimpressive.
Bad quality  The size of the toy was alot smaller than I thought. So, if you're buying this to cuddle, DON'T. The details were pretty good but the quality wasn't. It was delivered squished in a paper bag and his hat was deformed. After about a week, the soles of his shoes fell off! I give it 2/5.
so it looks dirty! So upset  Came with a giant black thread running down its entire face embedded right under the yellow, so it looks dirty! So upset!
Quality ok but appeared dirty and damaged  Thought I was buying a Douglas product...unfortunately my mistake. Quality ok but appeared dirty and damaged. This is being returned.
Disappointed  Cute but basically the size of a toy you'd get in a happy meal. I had to go out a buy a new gift. My fault I guess for not noticing the dimensionsm
a lot of flaws with the plush given to me  The claw is misaligned, the arms length are not the same. Don't buy it from here. It is way.. Way... WAY... Better going to the pokemon center yourself and finding the flawless one. Already notice it before but I don't bother reviewing it until I saw a flawless latias plush in the pokemon center in japan
Don't be fooled by the stock photo and good reviews  Don't buy this it does not appear as shown in the photo, the photo makes the toy appear more plush and high quality the eyes nose and fur look very accurate and  the doll even appears larger but you'll most likely not receive what is shown in the display photo  I purchased this for my nieces birthday because she likes the original Gremlins film as did and still do, and because I wanted to get her something completely different from the common toys that she see's and gets most often. the toy arrived very fast but upon opening the package and removing the plastic I immediately noticed the poor quality of the item the fur was glued on so cheaply that the fur was shedding & some is peeled off around the doll's mouth  The ears are hard cheap plastic, they're placed lower than the puppet in the film the eyes are also cheap looking and poorly painted they don't look realistic at all, also the fur was glued over the doll's nose so you can't see it's nose at all and another note the item was crammed in a small box the ears were causing the box to bulge slightly because the box was too small  The doll has no realistic detail accept for the shape of it's feet and hands, and with my nieces birthday just around the corner I have minimal time to hassle with returns. I can only hope that my niece still likes it with it's defects though I will be very nervous to give this to her due to it's poor quality design and condition  I'm actually very disappointed I was so excited at the thought of seeing my little niece's face when she received a cute realistic Gizmo toy from one of her favorite films but now I'll be cringing instead of being able to enjoy the moment, in fact if I had more time I would purchase something else in it's place sigh!  May update this review after I see my nieces reaction fingers crossed shoppers but don't buy this overpriced cheap piece of crap it's not worth the $15 plus change I spent on it, this item is more like a $6.00 dollar toy and barely that! with the fur falling off, it would have been helpful if there were real photo's posted for this toy instead of fake or stock pictures because if I had a more accurate idea of what I was getting I would have purchased something else instead of wasting funds on this terrible item.
Very cute but defective  I like that this toy glows, plays music and is from my childhood memory. I purchased one from Wal-Mart and later found that the one I viewed on Amazon was shipped without me doing so. But comparing the two, the one that came from Amazon seller, is smaller, doesn't have any stuffing around the voice box.
Not what I expected  Had no stuffing in the tail - looked like I could get it at the dollar store
Not tall enough for my daughter to use. It said it would stretch to 5' something. Believe me it won't. Maybe 3'.
Don't buy from this seller  Too small for the price  and the yellow book is missing :(  hair falls off  and neck crooked like seller:( amazon please  fix do not let  this seller sell any more :(
Carnival prize  This toy is like something one would win at a carnival.  It does not remind me of the toy the girl won in the movie at all.  it is definitely not fluffy
Broke when came.  Cute and she still played with it, it just didn't make any sound.
BOOTLEG ALERT!!!  It looks CLOSE to what it was supposed to be, so in that sense, I like it. What I DON'T LIKE, is that it's not official merchandise and should therefore be priced way lower than what was charged. The "Pokemon Center" tag pictured wasn't on it--dead giveaway that it's unofficial. One of the flame tipped tails is over its back instead of in the front like the photo portrays. There were loose threads hanging out too! The bottom materials tag DEFINITELY doesn't say "Pokemon Center" like it does in reviewer Plasma 2.0's photos!!! I received this as a very thoughtful gift and in an ideal world, there would be a REFUND for false advertising/FRAUD!!! Will be encouraging action!!!
Water gets in the toy and can only be used a few times.
Thought it was bigger!
Overpriced for the tiny size  It's cute, but holy crap is this thing TINY! I was expecting it to be 3-4 times the size. It's no bigger than a skinny beanie baby. When I hear "plush" (which it's not, BTW), I think stuffed animal. It's cute and looks exactly as pictured, but it's WAY too small for the price.
What a disappointment! What we received is an imitation  What a disappointment! What we received is an imitation, doesn't match the picture at all, the picture is misleading! The color of the Bonnie we received is almost pink, the eyes are plastic, and so on...Now to send it back will probably cost as much as i paid for the item, so my daughter is stuck with it. What a rip off, do not buy!
Terrible quality  First of all rip off. The tag says it is worth $5 which is more in line to what you get. I had been looking for a purple minion and thought I was lucky, now I have no gift to give on time and will need to Send a new toy across country. It is not stuffed with real material and does not look like it will hold up.
disappointing  Kind of disappointed. Got a lot of other plush toys for my son this one by far doesn't measure up.
NO!  This is very tiny and poorly made. Huge disappointment for my grandson, who was expecting something nicer. Wont buy again.
Mine was a pos  Stopped working after a couple days :/
Terrible quality!  Thos plush is very poorly made, and looks suspiciously inauthentic. Doing some research, however, I learned that most of the Mega Charizard X plushes are very poor quality, so this may or may not be authentic, but either way this is an uncomfortable and poorly made plush. I do not reccommend this product. Doesn't even look like a stable plush. Uncomfortable to hug and can't stand on its own.
poorly made
very bad design
Fake  This is a fake bowser jr. The original version has a sewed on bib and this imitation has an un -centered print.
DO NOT BUY! SAVE YOUR MONEY!  DO NOT BUY! SAVE YOUR MONEY! Arrived with a hole on the head. Poor assembly. Cheap materials! Glue showing! Stitches coming out! RUN do not walk away from this item RUN! So upset words cannot express!
Not happy  Does not work!  It came to me with arms and legs bent in an awkward position and instructions say do not bend. Once batteries were put in the Elmo did not work. Not happy at all
) was so bad I returned this item  The overwhelming smell of cologne (?) was so bad I returned this item. It was cute otherwise.
Not as cute as the photo  Very cute in the photo, looks different in person. Would have saved my money if I saw it in person
I am not satisfied with this  The packaging was so tight, leaving the plush deformed. The seam at the back is coming apart and the stuffing is coming out of it. This is not a well made item. I am not satisfied with this.
... gift was that the doll was small and a good fit for a 1 yr old  they stated that this sings a song and the only thing the Elmo doll does is say LA LA LA LA I am very very unsatisfied with this product was going to return but needed to give as a christmas gift and the only reason I gave it as a gift was that the doll was small and a good fit for a 1 yr old, also way overpriced for what the doll actually does.
Order Charlie Brown. Received Snoopy.  Ordered Charlie Brown and received Snoopy...twice.
Very poor quality. Won't hold up to even light holding. May be fine to sit on a shelf indefinitely.  My son saved all his money for this toy and it is extremely cheaply made. It's cute-looking, but after 2 days of him just holding it (nothing rough or anything), one of the hands popped free and isn't hugging the body anymore. I hand-sewed it on very sturdily and was surprised how thin the fabric covering the body is. The netting is so wide it is hard to actually sew anything on securely. The next day the tail came loose and with that the seam that holds the back together. So I feel like I am slowly sewing this whole thing back together. It's cute, I'll give the makers that, but aside from that, it is extremely poor quality.
Defective or a counterfeit item. Grrrr!  Defective? Knock-off counterfeit product? The velcro closure on the back will absolutely NOT close. You can stretch, pull, sweet talk it, swear and it's not going to help. This was ordered as a new baby gift. So, now what? Reorder and chance a second defective item and make the gift untimely? Sew it shut so parents can't replace batteries easily?  This is definitely not the quality of the Gloworm my children had.  In addition, I inspected the box and compared the product to the picture. Not the same! The mouth, cheeks, ears, stuffing-less body - even the box - do not match the picture. If you're of certain generations you'll remember the jingle "Oh, boy! It's a Hasbro toy!"  Well, not anymore. I think for the Gloworm "It's as Hasbeen toy :(" would be more appropriate.
Very dull colors, had to buy a different one.
Disappointed in presentation since they were  All 3 boxes came torn. Disappointed in presentation since they were gifts
Much smaller than expected
Pony made noises but sid not walk.
False Advertsement  The item shown in the picture is not what I received. I received a small keychain plushie.
Fast delivery!  Fast delivery... missed the Disney Original Tag and the tail fell off on the first use, disappointed, but happy to have Lumpy... Thanks!
Dislike
Received different color  The one I received is grey, a different color than displayed..the quality is nice and the product line is great, my daughter loves all of her farm buddies. The one I received just does not look like the image.
Came earlier then expected but the quality is bad.  The flames by the mouth is glued on you can still see the glue on the flame. Plus the flames are not even near his mouth but on his neck.
Small, not soft.
DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!   DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I'm so pissed off.. I bought this product thinking I would receive an adorable Jack Skellington doll but I received some stupid adapter I can't even use. I'm so disappointed that it didn't come since I'm a huge Jack Skellington fan!
Very disapointed  Certainly not worth the price we paid  It's a cute little thing  but  not worth that much money. Gift for child  that is different
Item not as shown. Close, but not the same.
I thought it was gonna be bigger
Fake, doesn't work, extremely cheap & brittle plastic, was already cracked. Really small, takes AAA, but marked and advertised as taking AA.
Is diferent sise is small 12 h
Not quite what I expected  It was not well made, the material was cheap and it was very itchy.  We have to return it unfortunately.
This is much smaller than described. Also quality was that of something youd win from a fair or out a claw machine. Absolutely not worth the price.
Way smaller than expected, compressed as well, the  line on the mouth was messed up a little. Overall, I was disappointed. I bought a Dragonite and I would say that the Dragonite was far more appreciated than this Charmander. I wouldn't recommend buying this item.
We ultimately didn't give this to the child it was for because it ended up not really looking like Pikachu.  The face was lacking sufficient stuffing and it made him look very strange. We ultimately didn't give this to the child it was for because it ended up not really looking like Pikachu.
Scam, knock off, garbage, never buy.  Check out my review for shadow freddy. this is the exact same company. horrible
I REALLY wish this could have been a better experience, but the seams on the back of Proto Man's neck were so poorly stitched (very loose), that its head nearly fell off the very day we received it.  Quite disappointing for both me an my son, as we both are loving him discovering old school video games.  At $12.50 per figure, I was expecting a better-made product!
NOT SOFT!  This toy is like hugging a brick!  Terrible product.  I was looking for a soft Elmo but what I got was an Elmo with a soft plush outside and an "inside" that feels like it is stuffed with rice or something......  If it wasn't for all of the fees to return, I would.  The other reviews say the product is soft but the one I got is not - very unhappy.
Not impressed with quality we had to repair a hole
Lies. All lies.  This doll does not talk. We received 1 and then a replacement neither of which talk as it clearly depicts in the details and pictures. We were disappointed!
Pokemon stuffed animal  I think it is too expensive (over $40). The wrapping was very bad, simply wrapped in a plastic shopping bag (cheap looking)
Wrong item
My son loved them.
Chinese Knock-off. Not real Nintendo item.  Chinese knock-off of Japanese item from G&G. Received fake plush "Cat Luigi." Shipped from China in plastic mailer, no box. Would have preferred real Nintendo licensed product. Cheap price should have been warning enough. Mustache is fur instead of stuffed (Nintendo never uses fur because it is messy). It and the sideburns are hot-glued on (something Nintendo does not do)... and unevenly. Some parts are either too small or too big. There is stitch work for the eyes, ears, and paws, but again, they are all either unbalanced, uneven, too small, too big, or off-center. There were a lot of threads sticking out of the stitch work that needed to be cut off. Tag has random bold print, inside of tag has bold hiragana only. An impressive knock-off actually, but I want my money to go to Nintendo, not some butthead pirates.
BIG HEAD  Head is over filled and just a round ball.  My kids told me it wasn't Zuma because it didn't look correcr.
Unproportional  The head is unproportional and very off. The headpiece is more raised and the eyes, as well as the placement, is rather off. I would not recommend buying from this seller.
Smelled awful!
Super small. Is NOT worth time or money  Super small. Is NOT worth time or money. This so called blanket is going back. Wouldn't even cover a newborn's arm.
My 7 year old begged for this toy and opted to use Christmas gift money for it. It is VERY SMALL for the money.
Pretty small, relative to the price  Pretty small, relative to the price. It kept my toddler occupied for a short period, but it's definitely not an item he seeks out.
False Advertising!  We only received 16 emoji keychains. The product name and description clearly states its an 18-pack. Returning due to false advertising.
Pretty ugly, not very well made. Wings very small, bent, flimsy. Not my favorite.
Pretty good but you pay extra for the brand not the product.
A lot smaller than I thought. Picture does no justice.
Toy came with rips.  The doll came with two tears, one on its neck and the other on the tail. The stitching is poor quality! It was advertised as an official pokemon licensed product, its not.
A Few Things  The head was kinda misshaped, and it really didn't look anything like the picture.., but its still kinda cute.., but it really isn't worth the money.
Wasnt new like it said , had been open and packing gone a few small stains
The recording sounded like a recording of a recording  The recording sounded like a recording of a recording, and our granddaughter did not like it and will not listen to it.
not as it was intended  the item came with the zipper not working, I had to replace it myself and pay extra. I needed to get it fixed since I was giving to my nephew for Christmas. the space is small so not much could be done. he loves Triceratops so either way It was an ok buy
It leaked during the first bath.
Zuma  Late and smaller than imagined
Quality Is... Well... No.  Shipping took a week longer than expexted, and there was a hole on each side of the body where the tail connects to the torso. I do not reccomend unless you are looking for something cheaply made. Fourteen year olds are usually easily pleased with things like this, but I can tell you that I was not.
THe monkey I got doesnt look like this picture  THe monkey I got doesnt look like this picture . The hands aren't on his face. Not happy just wanted what I thought I was getting like the picture shows  I will post a picture tomorrow
Never felt so stupid in my life  So I paid close to 30.00 bucks for this stuffed Charlie Brown and was I mortified when the one year olds mom opened it up in front of everyone at his party to discover it had a Kohls tag on it which mean it was the promotional doll for 5 bucks you get when buying the matching book!!!! Can you say RIPPED OFF!!!!!! Never felt so stupid in my life!
Did not like quality.  Returned item.
Read the Description Carefully!  Purchased for my daughter, a real Star Wars fan. Perhaps she didn't read the description, but this is much, much smaller than expected. Good quality, but small.
Ours arrived broken doesnt dance. Amazon is refunding me so i may purchase  another i won't be buying  the dancing one though cant risk it not working so near christmas. :( so ill be buying the singing only even though  it doesnt have replaceable batteries
Sound is horrible  Although the bird itself is fine the sound is nothing like the Common Loon. The one I received almost sounds broken or cracking sound in between the full sound when I press it. Wish I had never purchased this.
Fake  Fake don't buy
Very disappointing because she did not talk.
... have a deformed looking plush or does not look like the pic then get a refund  If you have a deformed looking plush or does not look like the pic then get a refund. It should look like the stock photo ( nintendo will not lie) If not then bootleg
VERY SMALL  This item is VERY SMALL....and I paid WAY TOO MUCH.  In looking at what other people paid for this same product, I'm now feeling ripped off. SO if you aren't being careful and you wanted something larger, you will be disappointed.  We also found the sound a bit "garbled" and hard to understand. I was really bummed as I had seen a LARGE one at the Disney store in NYC for $39 - but didn't want to pack it home, so I thought going online would be a better option. IF small collectables are your thing and the "talking" feature isn't a big concern - the toy seemed to be decently made. I will be RETURNING mine.
Only Olaf Arrived  Only Olaf Arrived :( we are waiting to hear on Sven and will update the review accordingly.
Tiny!!!  This is maybe 6" tall, smaller than the barbie version... not pleased!
The product I got did not match what I received
Battery Compartment Corrodded on Sully!  When we received it, the battery compartment and batteries were corroded and he did not work very well.  How long did he sit at the warehouse.  It's a birthday present for my grandson, and there is no time to get it replace.  Very very disappointed!!
Overpriced for quality  I purchased these for a birthday present and was very very disappointed when they arrived.  The description said two of the characters were 13".  The tallest was 11" the others came in at 10" and 9".  Also, one of the characters was not sewn properly, leaving a 1/4" hole in the foot.  They are going back and I will not replace them.
I ordered this as a gift for my niece on a whim not really checking the reviews and I wish I had.  The fact that it took over a month to ship from China wasn't the part that made this a negative review.  The fact that the product looks like it's something cheap you would win in a vending machine game or at a carnival that's annoying.  I take full responsibility for not investigating this item further, but still feel the need to warn others of what to expect if you order this product.
Gave it to my niece and pieces ripped of within 15 minutes of her playing with it.
POOR QUALITY.  NOT SEWN WELL...I AM ALWAYS STITCHING IT UP...
Preparing to return it!!  Not what I expected! Very disappointed!!
When it arrived it was nothing like the picture  I ordered this for a birthday, I payed a lot on shipping and handling to get it in time for the party. When it arrived it was nothing like the picture, what I got was an old, smelling, stained Mike. I would never recommend it. What you get does not look anything like the pictures.
Fisher-Price Nickelodeon Bubble Guppies Friends Mermaid  WAAY to much money for such a tiny little thing.  Cute but come on!
Fake...advertised at real item but buyer beware.  What I received is not an authentic Funko product.
Super! she loves Henry  Super!  she loves Henry, but he died very quickly and it is so sad
Frustrated  Loved this elephant until I went to buy two more for friends and the price DOUBLED. Will not be purchasing again. Very frustrating.
would recommend a different seller for this  soft and plushy, my little girl loves her new Shopkins plushie and carries her around everywhere, however after only 2 days there is a rip in the seam and my little girl is not rough enough to rip it, she's only 2 1/2, going to have to sew it tonight, would recommend a different seller for this product
Is this genuine? Shipped from China  This is actually a very cute Olaf doll and the quality is good.  My son was thrilled when he opened it.  My only complaint is it shipped from China - so I don't really know if this is genuine product.
Not expecte
Falling apart  It's been falling apart since we got it.  3 different seams bust and the stuffing has been falling out.  Worst stuffed animal ever.
YOU HAVE BEEN WARN !!  I bought this for my bf who loves celebi. we both noticed problems ...the eyes are too far up the head, the Antana both broken and the stitch is god awful. Yeah don't purchase this item not worth at all. YOU HAVE BEEN WARN !
very disappointed with this to0y  very disappointed with this to0y ...I thought it would be a lot bigger than what it is ...it was quite small and I do mean small for the price it wasn't worth it
My Sailor Moon doll did not look like the picture at all. Picture was very deceiving. Appointed.
no box!  No box, appeared unused but just came in plastic bag. Very embarrassed, but gave it as a gift anyway. :(
Very disappointed I expected something a little bigger next time y'all can say it's smaller than a baby .my grandbaby is  2yrs old n she's bigger than the doll
Should have listened to reviews...not original  We have bought the Mickey plush online from another seller and from the Disney Store, both were the original with the sewn in Disney logo on the foot...this IS NOT an original. Despite the 1/2 box it is wrapped in that says Disney on it, nothing else would be let you know it was really Disney (I'm sure the tag said it).  And if it is, this is not the one you want.  The material is similar if not the same to what kids Halloween costumes are made of from Walmart or something...thin.  Mickey's buttons are like the iron on type instead of the sewn in kind.  I could go on, but you get the point.  I guess this is not useless if you just want a cheap version, but you are not saving on the price, so why bother.  So get it from the Disney Store or from the ones on Amazon that show the sewn in foot in the photo and are 17".  Although, I did try again on Amazon that showed the sewn in on the foot...nope, another import.  We have two from there previously and now another on the way since we returned this one.  I am not sure why I didn't order from them again this time, but lesson learned.  Update: Received the one from the same link we bought from last time...import again.  Went to the Disney store and just got the real one for $20.  Worth it!  At least the picture has been updated now, what you see is what you get so if you like it, go for it.
It's a reason why this is getting 2 stars it not that cute
Stopped working  It stopped working within days. Changed the batteries and it stopped working within a few more days.  Not sure it would aid in potty training if it did work as it is supposed to.
The absolute worst company I've ever done business with!  I am going to try to write this review and give this come zero stars, but it may require me to give them at least one. The only reason I would give them one star, is so that I may get my word across. I ordered this item 2 weeks before Christmas and was a little nervous using standard shipping, so I contacted the seller and asked them if I should upgrade to expedited shipping. The seller assured me that there was plenty of time for me to receive my package on time. And that they knew it was a Christmas gift, so it would be shipped out the next day. This is their business, it's what they do all the time, so I trusted that they knew what they were talking about. Well, on Christmas Eve, the absolute latest date the package could have arrived, came and went and the package never arrived. I tried contacting them, but it took them several days to get back to me. This was the number one item on my daughters list! It was sold out everywhere and I was willing to pay this company $55.00 for a $17.00 toy. I looked back at my invoice from them, which had no tracking information provided to me, and noticed that the package was NOT sent the day after I ordered it, but 5 days later. When I finally got a call back from the seller, her excuse was that the post office sent the item to the wrong city. The post office ? They used regular mail? Yes, yes they did. The seller asked me how I could blame her for the error? Was she kidding? If you are going to sell an item on Amazon, charge a $38.00 premium, during the busiest time of the year, don't you think you should use a reliable shipping alternative? Or better yet, don't lie about when the package is going to be shipped out. It was no one else's mistake, it was theirs. To this day, the package has yet to arrive. Save yourself the hassle.
Small, cheap, coarse  In hindsight: I'd pay up to $10 for this because my children love the movie so much, but definitely no more. And the SHIPPING was that much. Ugh.
Item received is not what is pictured!  The item I received is not what is pictured! This says "Furby boom"& that is not what I got. We received a regular Furby. And it keeps falling asleep every 30 seconds with new batteries & playing with it!
product never worked from first day had to return it
not happy  i didn't get the laugh n learn cailou they give me a 12in caillou that didn't talk so no i wasn't happy
cheap material and the sound doesn't have good quality
The attached images show how my product differs from what is promoted from the Amazon image. The Plush's smile is not straight and looks jagged, the eyes are so high up on the face that it goes under the ears, and the seaming on the bottom is poor. The main reason why I'm giving it 2/5 stars than 1/5 stars is because the product came earlier than expected. It was suppose to come on December 28, but came on December 22.
I got the impression that I was getting a pacifier with a stuff animal attached to it.  There was no pacifier...I was really disappointed b/c it was going into a gift basket for a baby shower. I had to spend more money to buy a pacifier to attach to the stuff animal. Not happy bout that. If I knew, I wouldn't have bout this brand.
horrible  hate it because didn't come as big as 8 inches
This item was to fragile
No Good!!  The negative comments in the previous reviews are all justified.  This toy is . . . not so good.  Yes, Elmo saying your kid's name is cool.  But he only says about four other things, and he's frankly kind of hard to understand -- I've heard the story he tells six times now and I still can't get it.  The download issues are also a big problem, as is the fur falling out.  Oh, and the best part is Elmo calling out in the middle of the night wanting to play.  Please.  Buy something else.
counterfeit  I bought this based of the Super Mario Bro. label that is shown on the doll in the photo.  Upon inspecting the item after its arrival I have concluded there is no way this is a legitimate Nintendo product.  It is nowhere near the level of detail of the Nintendo dolls that I have purchased at the store.  The label is full of Asian text.  I just have a hard time believing this product is not a counterfeit.
Palm sized  Very small
wrongo  I ordered a fireman and received a policeman. Other than that, it is a nice size and decent quality.
Did not stretch like the advertising states
Make sure this item works........  There was nothing good that came out of this item.  I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift and she was so excited for elmo. Then I installed brand new batteries as directed and there was no response from Elmo. I tried other new batteries with the same result. I tried the trouble shooting tips...... nothing. I do not recommend anyone to purchase this. If you do, make sure it works before you give it to any kid. I did not enjoy seeing disappointment.
Rejected  My daughter did not like this toy for her children.
Knock off zelda  It's an OK Zelda. It's smaller then it looks and zeldas coloring is all wrong. Her hair is a neon yellow! Our daughter likes it well enough but our plush is nothing like what's pictured.  More like a knock off
Poor Quality  I just received the disco player zombie in the mail today. My son has been very excited about getting this since he is such a big fan of the game. When we opened the package I noticed that about 3/4 of an inch of the zombie's mouth is unstitched and the stuffing is coming out. I already think $12.49 is enough to pay for a small stuffed animal so I'm not going through the headache of paying even more to ship it back. My son hasn't noticed yet and he may not be bothered by it, but I do wonder how long it will even last. While I do like the product, the quality and quality control is lacking.
Not so good  I got these plush dolls for my grandson. I was very disappointed when I received them.  They are made of cheap material and quite expensive for what they really are.
Too expensive  Very small. Not what I expected for the price.
Ehh  For a plush, this TARDIS is terrible. The fabric feels weird, and the electronics in the top of it for the sound and light are extremely hard plastic, making you wonder why it's plush in the first place if it's terrible to hold.
Very Disapointed  I purchased this for my nephew becuase it was a boy doll and supposed to be educational. The doll is small and made cheaply. I got it for my nephew and was very disappointed. It is a boy
Light broke within a few days  Daughter loves it. But Im getting tired of explaining to her why Tigeys blue light is not going on. It broke in less than a week.
After 1 week of use it no longer stands up on its own either. Im conflicted on asking for refund, paying 5$ for shipping or just taking the 12$ loss and not ordering this again. my son is 6, he used it for 1-2 hours and it stopped holding up. no damage to it, no rips at all.
Are came apart within 5 minutes
Do not like the doll  Not what I expected. Do not like the doll.
Arrived damaged.  Product was torn up and damaged when it arrived. Not impressed. I didn't pay for an item that looked like it went through a paper shredder.
Not as described  The actual product looks nothing like the picture, It was delivered perfectly fine but the material and all rge features are all different
THEY SHRUNK!
it looks like the face was cut in half and squished back together and it smells like some cleaning product that could poison someone
Not a fan,  Not exactly what I was looking for.  My baby niece was not enthused.
Way over priced and he sheds like crazy!  30 inched is stretched out. Way over priced and he sheds like crazy!!! He also has black gunk all in his fur and makes him not soft
Pocket Monster is About Right  When I was looking at all these Eevee plushies I was expecting something much bigger, especially for the price. I failed to actually notice that it said it was 14cm in height, so I was extremely disappointed when I opened it up. I was hoping for a bigger doll that I could carry around for cosplay. I don't think I will be keeping these nor will I be ordering the others.
... smaller than I imagined and the voice doesn't sound like Barney.  It was smaller than I imagined and the voice doesn't sound like Barney.
Adorable
NOT plush. It IS a wire figure.  We like it a tiny bit but don't because it is not what is described. First it is very small. Smaller than described. It is NOT a plush as described. It is a wire doll of Jack with a tiny bit of stuffing. A plush doll to me, is a stuffed animal/doll type without thick wire in it.  This isn't cuddly or something to play with for a child. It is more of a wire figure and able to pose him anyway with the wire.  Only thing plush about him, is his tiny head. I would have sent back if it wasn't such a hassle to do.
disappointing  Doesn't work.  Going to try new batteries.  They cost almost 7$  should have to replace in a brand new toy!
Not what we thought we were getting...returned it
Doesn't work :(  We bought this for our son's bday and we were very disappointed that it does not work. We ordered the Tigger early to make sure he would have it. When we received the product the Tigger did not talk but we figured it needed new batteries. After opening it our son was so excited and kept pressing Tigger's belly...even have trying several different batteries the product does not talk. Very sad :(
and colors are more dull.  Not anywhere as cur as the photo. Body seems much smaller than in picture, and colors are more dull.
Too expensive.  Smaller than a can of soda. Expensive.
balls are terrible  I got this for my son for his 1 year birthday...the pit is so colorful and cute but within minutes he had every single ball punctured from his teeth. For a kids product the balls should be more durable so that they aren't ruined right away. Very cheap product and do not recommend.
You get what you pay for  Fell apart 2 days after my son added to his collection. I guess you get what you pay for. Got more excitement waiting for my order to come in the mail lol ended up ordering from a different place.
Very upset that they shipped it to me knowing it was missing the spike turtle  Was missing the hanging spike turtle. My daughter was very dissatisfied
VERY Disappointing Quality in a Plush  I have two children who LOVE anything Mario or Sonic related.  My 9 yr old son decided he wanted a black Yoshi to go along with his officially licensed green one.  I ordered it for Valentine's Day knowing how excited he would be.  I received the item and was VERY disappointed.  The item is black but they used WHITE thread to sew it together.  The stitching along both arms and both legs were loose/stretched so that you could see the white threads everywhere.  In addition, there was a white "knot" of thread on the top of the head.  At first I thought it was stuffing coming through a hole.  Turns out it was just a bunch of threading.  Based on how rough they play with their other stuffed toys, this wouldn't have lasted a week.  Overall, I was incredibly unsatisfied and I returned the item.  If you are looking for something to just sit on a shelf for display, the item may work for you.  If you want it for actual use by a child, keep looking
Disappointed, it only talked for two day, poorly made
I don't like  the box is damaged and broken, I don't like
These make awesome personalized gifts  I have been these for a couple of months now, for gifts. These make awesome personalized  gifts.  EXCEPT -The price just DOUBLED!!!!! Why????
Derpy  its really derpy looking :/
:(  It looks nothing like the one in the picture. Poor quality.
This things smells horrid!
Two of three buckle types are awful  My two year old son loves to buckle things and can sit forever buckling and unbuckling straps on backpacks, etc. I thought this was the perfect solution. I bit the bullet, though, and paid what I thought was pretty expensive for a pillow with buckles thinking he would go nuts for it. He has hardly touched it since we got it. It has three different types of buckles and two of them are tricky EVEN FOR ME. The small size and thin flimsy plastic nature of those buckles make them even harder. There is the regular type of buckle where you squeeze the two sides that you see on everything- backpack straps and waist straps, etc. Then one of them has a circular push-button in the middle and one has a square push button. Those are the two that are hard. It was a waste of money, and a lot of money at that.
My grandson enjoyed these.
Elmo's face looks deformed!  I'm glad my 20 month old doesn't notice but Elmo's face looked really strange. Something must be wrong with the stitching.
Way over priced received it in a bag not worth the money.
Don't waste you money on these fake ones  These are cheap knock-offs.  They were falling apart within minutes. You can get the real deal at Walmart for only a few dollars more.  Don't waste you money on these fake ones.
bad, don't buy!  BAD DONT BUY, I RECEIVE MINE AND DOSNT WORK!
Not What I Expected  Floppy with crooked everything.
Looks like crap
Deception!  Wow  talk about a BAIT & SWITCH ! This is only 5.30",,,, No Where Near 8-10" !!! Also it is a small keychain holder/ backpack clip,,,& No Where is it EVIDANT Or Descriptive Of what it REALLY IS !!! So AGAIN,,,, IT IS "NOT" 8-10" ! ! ! ! Sometinng to get in a kids Happy Meal 
Not as expected ; cheaply made , was not at all worth the price of the item or the shipping cost .
Annoying and hard to manuever  Bought this for Christmas as a gift, could barely shoot it across the room as it was very stiff. The "moo" sound was sort of pathetic, total disappointment.
The product does NOT work  I am upset that when I gave it as a gift for Christmas it did not work.  We put brand new batteries in & it still does not work.  I would like to return & get a new one. Thank you, Joysan Howard
Reminds me of a free stuffed animal in the claw game  Yucky hard hard stuffy. Not soft and plush
i thought it was going to be a large size like in the image but i was a small and i did not really like that ebay sold this for 24 dollars more and in large
Nice toy... Not very durable  Great little toy.. Cept this is the 3rd one I've gone through... They don't last more than a couple days with my toddlers... Though the first 2 were a fluke but realize the fabric they use for the pink is really thin and not durable... Rips super easy... Know this as the last one I bought arrived last week is ripped in 3 places... My toddlers are rough but they have lots of other toys that don't rip so easily
Cute While It Worked  it's cute and baby loved it while it worked, which was less than a month.
Nothing like the picture  Not sure what we received, but our Wal Nut is yellow.  Nothing like the picture.
Dolls are poorly made. Much smaller than pictured.
The faces on two of them were upside down. That's why 2 stars.
FALSE ADVERTISING  My roomate bought this for me as a gift, trying to help me with my collection and this showed up, no tag at all I'm very disappointed. Its NOT an original TOMY you can tell its a knock off. Granted it's still cute I absolutely love Vaporeon and I'm going to keep it regardless, It only gets 1 star because its cute.
Ok  Good but the music box in the toy is already broken and does not play the I Love You song.
Misled and Disappointed  When I bought this Pichu plush, I was excited to get the item they showed in the picture. However, upon its arrival, I noticed that something was amiss. Instead of representing the adorable anime/game character that I know and love, the plush I received looked like an ugly yellow rat with a face too small and ears too big. Since I have purchased Pichu plushes in the past, I have strong suspicions that the plush I received was a fraud-- a sad knock-off of the Pokemon franchise. I have mistakenly bought other suspicious plushes from this seller, and my personal recommendation would be to stay away from them entirely. It's not too difficult to find quality Pokemon plushes from other Amazon sellers, and in the future I will do just that.
Wtf did i just get. The stitching looks like crap. Its mouth is sideways and looks stiched by some 5 year old. Unsattisfied. I skipped a day of school today expecting to get by easy, but the teacher was not fooled.
Not happy with it at all  The toy was not all that for the price. The back had been torn open and resown. Not happy with it at all.
Not at All what i thought!! I didn't know how to Return the item. Awful just Awful.
Fake of used  The item I received is not what is pictured. I either got a used item or a very poorly made knock off.  There were no tags, it was dirty, it had a hole in it, and the glasses were totally different (and not in a good way).
Apparently bootlegs are acceptable as selling products  I got the generic, fake, bootleg, etc. Rosalina plush. I can't believe that they would give a false Rosalina plush in the name of Sanei, an official company that makes official Nintendo plushes. It's truly a disgrace to say that the Rosalina plush I got is from Sanei. I recommend to order from other countries that is NOT China since I have a feeling China just loves to send bootlegs. You all have been warned!
Looked used and washed. Returned
Very disappointed.  Shipping was right on time but unfortunately, the actual product was damaged.  The tag was all chewed up and there were black marker type markings on top of the toy.  Very disappointed.
Highway robbery!  It is not more than six inches tall and has no embroidered seal on his foot. Also the tag attached says its MSRP is $9.95. I paid $24... See my photos... Obviously returning. Hopefully this was just a warehouse mistake, if not, then buyer beware!
Horrible tiny and looked cheap!!!
The bunny I received was not exactly the one pictured. Similar, but not even close to the same.
Seems used  It looks used. Bow was already ripped
Nice doll, but my came damaged  I was very excited about this doll. I bought all the characters for my 3 year old for xmas this year, but Elsa came dirty. Her hair had some sort of dye on the bangs & in her braid. Had to return it, but will be buying another one elsewhere, so her collection will be complete.
Cute, but both times ordered plush elephants and the boxes smell so much like cigarettes.  This was meant to be a gift for a baby and I was very disappointed that they smelled like they were sitting in a smoker's home for days!!
Cheap  Cheaply made. As soon as my daughter opened it the paper "background" of the castle came off. I glued it back. The doll doesn't even look like sleeping beauty. The fact that it turns into a purse like toy is nice though.
The bow tie was ripped and the head is a lot bigger than expected. I got it for my girl as a Christmas gift....so I would say that I if I had the time I would buy another brand.
Dissapointed  Was not very happy. Got the fox and it was squished and had a hole in it... not able to use anymore and had to throw away. Was supposed to be for my sons first birthday.
hello kitty is not 15in it is 10 in very disappointed  Hello kitty was not 15 in as mentioned it was more like 10 in in height I was very disappointed. And the face of hello kitty did not look legit. So basically hello kitty was thrown up on a closet since that is not what I had expected.
I paid for a singing Barney that doesn't sing  I received the first Barney that's supposed to sing and I didn't!! I let them know they want want to send another, and as I squeeze the second one again there's no sound!!
Hes soft and comfy but  He didn't even have a mouth or claws.. I think I got a defect...
But....Y!  one of the most regretable decisions I've ever made. I bought X so why not Y. his head and neck are completely crooked and unfixable. the wires that connect his wings to his spine  snapped in half due to bad packaging (don't cram all my S**t in one small bag!). I would have returned it but that just would have been more hassle when I probably would even gotten a worse one.
Barney doll  My son did not like it. Voice sounds nothing like barney.
Hard fabric for kids  Hard "stuffed animal" Fabric very stiff and uncomfortable for kids.
Great idea not very durable  Arrived on time and is a great idea as it helped keep my daughter's pacifier easier to find. She liked it because it was a lovey to hug with her pacifier. I give this one star though cause the snap that holds the pacifier broke within a week.
Junk  Doesn't even fly straight, and not even cute - doesn't look as good as the picture. Very inconvenient and awkward to use.
Not very well made. You can see the glue and it makes the toy roughn
The doll I ordered was not 17inches as stated and was not soft from head to toe as stated. The doll I received had a hard plastic head with two hard points which seems dangerous for a small child. I'm very disappointed to not have received what was pictured and stated here. This was not worth $30.
I wouldn't recommend buying this for bath time  We received this as a gift, however, it allowed water in on the very first use. With a battery, that is not safe at all. I wouldn't recommend buying this for bath time.
tiny  I cant believe how tiny this plush is! It was quite a disappointment when we pulled it out of the box. Its about the size of a roll of toilet paper!
Not water proof,no packaging,no batteries. Garbage!  The single item arrives without any protective packing and it has a hole which let's the water in... In addition to the fact that this piece of plastic costs 15 a piece, and has no batteries.... It is a piece of crap!
Buyer beware ! This is a very small doll.  this is a little 8 inch tall stuffed item.  I paid $50 for it.  My fault,there was no physical description of it on the site.  I saw dolls this size for about $13 and thought it was going to be MUCH larger. Way too expensive when there are other sites much lower price. Buyer beware.
RIP OFF!!!!!  Do not waste your money this is over priced. You can purchase it at the Disney Store right now for $15 when not on sale it is usually $20-$25.
Not worth it  A lot smaller than what the picture presents. Prob woulda been better to spend the extra $5 on one thats well made
... came ripped from the hat and shirt it was bad quality  It came ripped from the hat and shirt it was bad quality
Beware  It is a miniature doll , do not buy
Cute  Doesn't work on carpet.  Cute little thing but it was on it's side after the first second.  Had to return it as my house is carpeted throughout.
NOT PLEASED  Much smaller than what I thought it would be. It came in faded in color, and had stains all over it!
Does not talk.  Does not giggle.  Grunts only.  Completely incorrect description.  Very misleading.
very poorly made  This is NOT like any of the other Yoshi toys my son has. It will definitely fall apart with the way he plays with his Yoshi's (which get thrown around and whipped around by their arms....we have had them for over a year and are still in excellent condition). I will NEVER buy another from this place. It is partially made of felt and the stitching was already coming undone when we received it. PIECE OF JUNK.
Not worth for 3 yr old. It's baby toy
the quality would be better given that it's sold on Amazon  I wish I hadn't been in a rush and had actually read reviews. As others stated, it's tiny and cheaply made. I had incorrectly assumed that for the price, the quality would be better given that it's sold on Amazon. I couldn't be more wrong.
Let me first say this toy is ADORABLE.  And I give it one star for every day that the nose and the song worked when you squeeze it-- that translates to 2 DAYS!  That's it!  I expected more.  If your child doesn't care about the song or Rudolph's light up red nose, then you're in luck.  If not, maybe go for another Rudolph. :-/  I also reached out to the manufacturer, but received no response.  Rather disappointing.
FAKE ITEM!  FAKE ITEM! I have tried to write detail but amazon just censors it.
Doesn't say movie lines  Well... it talks, or making noises I should say. It does not say any lines from the movie, not even the one written right on the front of the box. May as well save a few bucks and get one that doesn't talk.
not put together well  The doll isn't put together very well and is a little fragile. The egg is held on by a few stitches and I'm waiting for one to snap. It was also wedged in the box in such a way that the peak above his eyes is now sloping down instead of up. This coined the term of "Neanderthal Togepi." Also one foot is almost twice the size of the other. With all that said though, she still loves it!
... was really excited when we ordered these but very disappointed when we got them  My daughter was really excited when we ordered these but very disappointed when we got them.  They're faces are not like the picture and she now refuses to even look at them, even though we've squished the face to try and make them look better.
Price Gouging is taking place HERE  So I wanted to get a nice stuffed Star Wars toy for my month year old son, his first.  This seemed like a safe choice and it is, all soft faux fur, the bandoleer is soft fabric, the eyes are stitched on and not plastic.  My problem is that I paid almost $40 for this thing and it didn't really seem like a $40 item.  What REALLY pissed me off is when I pulled the white sticker off the tag to see the real price is $19.95 USD!!!  The fact that the vendor tried to hide this fact to me is the main reason I am returning this.
Big price, little toy.  It was very little for the price.  I bought this as a gift and was disappointed how small it was.
Disappointing  Unfortunately I did not read the reviews before I purchased this toy. It is not a sweet plush toy with a 3D face that I saw in some toy shop and the one I actually purchased from Amazon based on the image and the product description. This toy has a painted face and is much different from the one shown in the picture. For me it is too much trouble to send it back. However I am really disappointed. It would be great if the Amazon changed the picture. I would never purchase the toy I received.
Disappointment  The product was of very poor quality. It was the same plush item you can find at the quarter grab machine.
Not worth the price...  I paid $24 dollars for this Bullseye.  I went to the Disney Store a week after I received it and found a Bullseye twice as big for $10.
Don't be mislead by the price!  This is a very poor reproduction of Shaun the Sheep and it stinks!
hate it so so so so so so so much  I hate it because my son likes the real plushies this one is fake peas of crab my son hates it
Wrong item sent.  I did not get the correct item sent and it was too late to get a replacement in time for Christmas.
they forgot to put the face on the doll!  it came WITHOUT a face! No eyes, no eyebrows, no mouth. WTF?
like I was  It's only 7 inches tall....Don't be fooled...like I was... Super cute but it's so small... Not much bigger than my hand
By the time we opened the gift the nose was falling down, we did some stitches tho.
Buyer Beware - The item is for a random one in the photo  Buyer beware! The photo shows both the lion and the elephant but only one was received (the elephant in my case). No where in the seller's description does it mention you will receive a random one. Otherwise an adorable stuffed taggie toy, but definitely should specify random or give the option to choose which one.
The toy was cheap and stopped working after a couple of weeks
Please do better  This product is not large or jumbo. False publication.  Shipping is 1 lb not 4lb. Very disappointed in the whole situation and company
Covered in glue...falling apart...same as the rest of the reviews
$$$$$  PleSe don't pay $52 !! I found 2 almost identical to this Poppy at Walmart! $7 with a blanket and 15$ even bigger then this one and actually better made !
DECEPTIVE PICTURE  Absolutely deceptive picture. If you order this item expect to to get 3 SMALL plush toys about 6 inches in height. NOT the toys in the picture!!!! I will definitely not order from this place again due to its advertising and misrepresentation of its products alone. The picture needs to be taken down and replaced with a proper representation of the product.
Not as pictured, got a cheaper looking model instead.
It looks nothing like the push image shown  It looks nothing like the push image shown. It is a very small advent calendar size plushie for the price of a full size one you can buy at the Disney store. Returning it was not worth it to pay $6 to send it back. I will keep it and put it into a stocking stuffer. Lesson learned read more about the description and do not go by the picture. I saw the full size plushie in the picture at the Disney store for $12 and expected this to be the same one. Very disappointed in this....
Don't buy it! Cheap knock off!  This product is cheap. I'm certain it is a knock off! Not a Hasbro! It is not 12 inches as described. It is only 9. Poor Quality item!
Not worth the money
Not authentic! No tags!  Not authentic.  Came without tags.
Worst  Do not waste your money horrible toy extremely big totally not what I expected when I received it please don't waste your money
I am very disappointed.  Doll didn't sing. Unfortunately, I received the doll on the day of my granddaughter's birthday and wasn't able to return it. You cannot take a doll away from a 2 year old and expect her to understand. I am very disappointed.
my daughter was also disappointed. Too expensive for the size  I had no idea it was so small, my daughter was also disappointed. Too expensive for the size!
Waste of money  What a dissapointment!!! The doll is only about 12 inches tall.  It was missing one of her flowers on the headband and one fell off when I opened the bag it came in.  Waste of money.
Not the workmanship you would expect from Disney. Cheap embellishments.
it never un smushed from the packaging
It looked very fake and not too much like a dog  All the other reviews on here are very positive. I don't understand because we were very displeased with it. It looked very fake and not too much like a dog. Got it for our dog to cuddle and take care of but she didn't care. We bought another stuffed dog animal from TJ  Maxx and she loves it.
Sent it back didn't work out of the box
Was very small like a hand puppet maybe even smaller than that  was not worth the money at all. Was very small like a hand puppet maybe even smaller than that..
Displeased.  Bad quality. Stuffing came out of hat the first day. Looks like a cheap imitation. Not pleased.
I would like to return this  I would like to return this !  Not what I  expected ! Please send me a return label ! Thank You
This product arrived without the markers.  It was very disappointing.  Not worth it at all.
just makes a sound like its battery is low  The toy was defective. It does not talk when you squeeze it, just makes a sound like its battery is low.
sewing came apart easily.  Poorly made. sewing came apart easily.
Just received to give to granddaughter for her 4th birthday. She loves Agnes! The doll is Cute enough but it's nearly impossible to get the batteries in,the screw is so teeny tiny so I amnot able to try it out.seriously thinking of returning. Frustrated Grandma
Don't buy  Cheaply made. I've gotten several plushies from china and this is by far the worst
Pitiful  I chose this item because the description stated that you could speak into a recorder and the talking ben would repeat what you say. However, it did not work that way at all. This plush toy only makes a few awful sounds. My 3 year old niece was initially intrigued, but that ended just as quickly. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
Not what I ordered...  So I can't really review this item because Amazon sent me the wrong product. They sent me the fuzzy sailor Skipit plush instead of this one. I ordered this one because it is similar to the pacifier holder one we already have and absolutely love, but since we go something totally different I can't say much about this one. Debating on what to do about it but thinking it's not really worth the hassle to return the one we ended up with. I wanted this one because it doesn't have all the stuffing in the body and I would feel better about putting it in the crib with my kiddo, the one we got was a regular stuffed animal and I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving it in the crib.
After the first 10 minutes it stopped syncing with the remote; would only work on demo mode. Dont waste your money id your child is old enough to not be fooled into thinking its working while on Demo mode
and has mild music it's OK but I've had better Elmo for my baby  Elmo mouth does not move it says Elmo so sleepy,  and has mild music it's OK but I've had better Elmo for my baby
Did not work right out of the box.  We received our package on time. That was the only good thing. We installed brand new batteries as directed and there was no response from Elmo. We tried other new batteries with the same result. We tried the trouble shooting tips...... nothing.
Too Small For The Price!  I was very dissappointed when I saw how small it was.  I would not recommend buying this for $13.. This should only be around $8.. I bought Yoshi and Luigi for around $10.. And they were a lot bigger than Daisy!
Looks different when I recieved it not same as picutre had to return
Keychain sized, for $20 def not worth it
They lied about the size of the toy! It's really small
they eyes didn't look that great  it was in my opinion not that greatly made. there was alot of glue around the ears and they seem if u pulled at them they would come off. they eyes didn't look that great either
junk  This company has the worst frozen dolls I have ever seen.  I would not waste  any money on this carp.
Very small  This item is a lot smaller than I was expecting. Returned it, but had to pay for return shipping.
Cute but very poor stitching. We bought as a present from Santa and in 2 days the neck split open.
I wanted to like this item  I wanted to like this item, however the quality was poorer than I expected for the price. Not soft or cuddly at all, and not as cute in real life as in the photograph.
very small not worth the money  very  small  not  worth  the  money
Cute but poorly made  The seaming on this adorable PIKACHU is not great. I've already had to stitch up two seams that were pulling apart.
Much smaller than expected  Based on the $27.99 price, I expected a larger toy. The picture also implies the doll is larger when in fact it is tiny. It is just at nine inches but its overall size is very small. A nine inch full stuffed doll is what i expected. It seems like a $15 toy.
Cute but flimsy  Update:  I did give the other five animals to the grandkids, ages 4 thru 8, and none of the kids could shoot the slingshot animal more than about a foot.  The rubber is too stiff for little hands to pull back very far.  I thought they'd have fun with them but after a few unsuccessful tries no one played with them.  Combining this with the fact that the toys break easily I wouldn't recommend them for little kids.  I bought six of these flying animals and although they're cute, they are extremely cheap.  I tried each of them out before I put them in my grandchildrens' stockings.  One of the cows' legs broke the very first shot I took with it.  With shipping costs it's not worth sending back so if you decide to buy one you are taking your chances that it will last more than 5 minutes.
Too small for the price
This toy arrived wet and covered in mildew.
Cheap  This is very cheap looking.  Not what the picture shows at all.  Waste of money!  Very dissapointed in quality!  I hope my daughter isn't too upset when she sees this.
Not New  The doll was overpriced, but I decided to go forward anyway since I've been waiting for the price to come down from the sky high prices of the spring.  The doll arrived quickly, but someone had drawn on the face and colored on blush on her cheeks.  I don't know if this is someone reselling a returned doll or what, but it was definitely not "new" as advertised.
Picture and name don't match.  I guess I should have seen that the Name for this product says "JOY," because the picture is for NOEL (Lime Green hat, as per the product description). If you order this, you'll be getting the RED mermaid, not the green one pictured here. You've been warned.
poorly made. Kid still likes it  Bought two of these, although only one from Amazon.  Both broke within a week.  My son still likes it, just poor quality but you can't expect anything more from a Chinese product.
Poorly Made Toy  Gave it to a friend's son for his birthday. The seams did bust right away, within just a few days. Despite being cute, this item is poorly made and not worth $13.
Received defective one - twice!  I never leave reviews but was so irritated by this one I felt the need to share my experience. I tried to buy this as a gift. The first one I received was defective and did not play music, so I exchanged it. The second one I received was defective, too (same issue - it would not play music) so I just got a refund and said forget it! Extremely disappointed. When something like this happens one, you think - awe, bad luck. But not when it happens twice in a row.
waste of money. Go to the disney store to get it for one fourth of the price.
Like many others, received incorrect item  Bad.  Item received was a prize-only version (cheaper, intended for carnival/theme-park type games and not sold individually), rather than the one pictured.  Pros:  - Almost decent looking (minus the permanently scrunched up side of the face), despite not being the one pictured.  - A little bit larger than the official plush.  - It's a prize-only version, without needing to lose a million dollars at a carnival/theme-park game.  Cons:  - "Prize-only" version, not the official plush from Square Enix. This wasn't earned from a game, don't make me a cheater.  - Lower quality than the official plush; but that would be expected of a prize-only version.  - The face on one side was permanently scrunched, as it was created that way; it had looked like it was punched in the face and given a permanent wink (attempting to stretch it out failed, as it was sewn together this way).
Arrived damaged  Disappointed, arrived with the battery pack shattered. Doesn't work
poor quality toy  product is extremely low in quality.  Does not move hardly at all...batteries were dead when received
CHECK THE SELLER... knock offs are possible!  I hate giving this a 2 star, but I'm not really sure what to do.  I should have heeded the warning of other reviews, but they didn't have any information on which seller was the bad one. I ordered this Fennekin first from the seller  7 STAR PROJECTS.  It was a knockoff!!!!!!  I then ordered it again, Amazon fulfilled, and it was the real thing.  Please see my pictures in comparison.  The darker yellow one is the "real" one and is great quality, and the lighter yellow one is poorly stitched, had stuffing falling out... is just awful.  I own probably 10+ of the Tomy Pokemon plush and they are all wonderfully made.  I knew something was off as soon as I unboxed the  7 STAR PROJECTS Fennekin.  So in short... 5 Stars for the Amazon fulfilled Fennekin.... -300 stars for 7 STAR PROJECTS Fennekin.
Would Be Nice If It Worked...  Stitching could have been tighter and it doesn't work... It doesn't talk or have a place for you to get to the box to figure out what's wrong.
Not a great quality product
Bad quality, particularly small and highly unsuitable for children.  I am most disappointed!
Looks blue and this stuffed toothless has a crazy looking face
Very disappointed  Received item that was defective. Did it talk or make noise at all. Replaced. Stress and still not lick. This was supposed to be a special gift and I couldn't give it! Very disappointed
I was a little bit disappointed with the workmanship on this  I was a little bit disappointed with the workmanship on this. The left ear was a lot smaller than the right
Suck  Recieved bear Glow didn't work
Description says 8" tall when it's actually 4" I ended up ordering a new one from the official website instead.
Crappy Unicorn  I got the unicorn quite promptly and was pleased by that aspect. You cannot beat Amazon Prime. The toy, however, looks like it was a few steps short of being complete. The tail and hair are more like troll hair than fluffy unicorn hair. Also, the toy is not that soft--nor is it fluffy. Seems like a poorly-made toy that would be in a claw machine at the arcade. :( Disappointed.
to small for the price
Sad wish the music at least played  Lasted a week then stop working. It's intended for kids they should make it withstand a child. Sad wish the music at least played!!!
not worth it  The antennae are different lenges and torn up. The paint in the antennae and head is messed up pretty bad. And its really noticeable. Other than that, its soft. Which is the only reason i gave it 2 stars. Dont recommend.
Not even the color suppose to be!!!!  These were suppose to be off white, but we're black when I received them!!!!!  They velvety stuff is coming off on everything!!!!  I would not purchase again nor recommend purchasing this item!!!
Wouldn't recommend this one in particular  much smaller than anticipated and really didn't stretch much at all before it just  simply ripped!.  One upset little girl.  Wouldn't recommend this one in particular.
I was not happy with her.  Her pants were ripped and would not stay up
Just received the Elmo, and it is a cheap knock off. No Gund label, very low quality. I have already called to request a full refund and will be purchasing from a brick and mortar to make sure I get exactly what I want. If you take your chances, be sure to allow enough time for a return.
Not as it seems  Kind of disappointed... The plush I received is nothing like the one in the image shown... The legs and body are a lot smaller...very unsatisfied.
Horrible Toy  This doll can't hold its head up, it is poorly made and depressing to look at.  It can't be fixed.  For what could have been a happy character, my child will need to use both hands to hold up his head just trying to look him in the eyes.  Awful product.
Not as cute as picture. Too flat.
Pinker than the pictures, so that's great. The downside is that it quit singing after a week and I can't get the screw out to check the batteries.
These are the worst representation of the Trolls  These are the worst representation of the Trolls!  They were made in China and we had to wait until after Christmas for them to come in.  They are truly now worth it!  Save your money!
Not worth the money....disappointing product.
Very disappointed on the  This item arrive ripped off on the neck part, supposedly new. Very disappointed on the quality
VERY unhappy it arrived out of the original package and says that nowhere on the item.
My child is 11yrs of age when open was too scary, has scary teeth with fangs.
Not worth it!!  Bought this as a Christmas gift. This item is extremely small, smaller than a baseball, and is not suitable for young children. The Elmo "toy" is overpriced to begin with then to pay for shipping, not worth it!! I would shop somewhere else for a Elmo toy.
This was verrry small
Great way to frustrate a toddler.  Good idea, but poorly executed. The fasteners are the right size for little hands, but the vest, pants, and shoes should come off, but they don't. Nothing does. So, the reward for your toddler finally getting the buckle through is... Nothing. He thinks he's going to get the shoe off, but no, the shoe doesn't come off. I understand not wanting to lose the parts, but that could be worked around. My 2.5-year old really liked this doll for the first 10 minutes, then got so frustrated he asked me to put it away. Glad I got it on a lightning deal at least.
it is more like 4-5" does not look like the  The write up says this is 7", it is more like 4-5"  does not look like the picture
You can definitely tell this one came from China! It came barely wrapped in anything but tape and a customs label. It had no tag like the other Minions I have purchased and the sewing quality is very poor. Looks like a 2 year old put it together.
I ordered the first one which would not work at all.  When the replacement came it would not turn off!  Both sent back.  I won't reorder this product.
Its really small
Not happy  I was expecting it to be a little bit bigger. Especially for $26. Nice quality and everything but you could probably get a better deal at the Disney store.
Cute but not for very young children/babies  Ordered this to match the hat and elvish shoes set for my baby. Unfortunately, when it arrived I noticed that the furs/hairs easily fall out of the stuffed animal if even slightly tugged. It would probably be OK sitting on a shelf, or used as a decoration, but it's not something I would let my infant or toddler play with. It's too bad, because it really is cute. Disappointed to have to return it.
Did not come in a box- seriously considering a return. the 'I talk' sticker looks worn. definitely not brand new.
Very disappointed.  The giggle is very soft, hard to hear - and it is very difficult to get the ball to work.  Very disappointed.
Elmo blues  I hate Elmo ours won't bounce and it's game can't move on. Good luck getting it out of her hands to send it back
KILL YOURSELF
Received mine with a nice huge tear in the neck just in time for Christmas!
My 9 year old son received this for getting good grades and he had it 1 day  My 9 year old son received this for getting good grades and he had it 1 day.  He wasn't rough with it but its tail busted open at the seam. Needless to say we were both bummed about it.
Looks good but doesn't even say anything  Looks good but doesn't even say anything, just makes noises. My son who is obsessed with the movie loves it, but when he pushes the button to make it talks he doesn't like it, no "key phrases" if you want a none talking smeck that is cheaper, I would go with this, the extra money for a talking one is not worth it, at least not for this one.
Not too happy with this product although my son is in-love with it.  The left leg was detached and I had to spend time sewing it back together just after 2weeks of having it.  Not very good quality at all.
2 stars :(  Looks good but i hate to touch it because there are some areas in the head where the hair was torn and its feels weird and dirty .. some kind of glue maybe.
For what they charge thing thing is TINY, about 7" tall.  I was expecting a MUCH larger version as this was a gift for my daughters birthday and she loves Hei Hei.  I'm really disappointed, I wouldn't pay more than $4-5 for something like this and I got had at $28
Bad design  This hand puppet was very disappointing and expensive for what it is. First off, it's quite small- only little hands can fit comfortably inside. The puppet is supposed to follow the story, Pete the Cat and His Four Groovy Buttons, but it only confuses children. The second from top button, which is attached with velcro allows one to pull it off, which is great. However, the other buttons are stationary, so when children try to follow the story and pull the buttons, they rip at the shirt, nearly destroying the toy. I don't recommend at all. If I had physically seen one first, I would not have purchased.
Not well made.  Entire back stitching came apart after 2 months. Very disappointing.
Very small and ugly .. returned it right away
Smell weird!!!!  They put a lot tape around it.  When I open it. It smell weird!  I have to wash it before give kids.
not exactly what i expected. more of a huge size doll.
Dont buy doesnt work !
Not as expected  The product doesn't look like it's shown in the picture, Much smaller limbs and head, antenna aren't as I expected.
Very unhappy with this toy.  The ball didn't giggle!
Doesn't really look like the picture  The material is lighter than in the picture. And it had a string hanging from its head. Doesn't really look like the picture. But son still liked it.
Very small  Extremely small I expected it to be a lot bigger if it cost almost $20.
I had to return this, because, when I got it, it looked totally different from what it looked on-line.
Was not well made. Would not give this to any child.
Light doesn't last  Son loved it, but the light burned out in less than a month.
Don't  buy it!  The eevee we got was different feom the one pictured. It looked very cheep and it is made that way. We gave it to our 8 year old for her birthday. It wasn't 24 hours before it was falling apart. She loved it anyway though and refused to give it up so it could be replaced.
Not as described.  The item said it was only missing the tag and in good condition. The white fluffs of hair on her cheeks and head are all dried up and clumpy. Not soft and furry.
the Mario's nose come off the first day. :(
Not brand name as advertised
What a disappointment  I bought this for a Christmas present for my daughter which is 18 months old. She loves Elmo and says Mo MO. I typed in everything I needed go to download it into Elmo doesn't download. Tried for the second time no download says not connected to doll checked it and it was. So go and download everthing typed in everything on husbands computer still same message. So frustrated I call the company If you have WINDOWS XP the download will not work. So my little girl doesn't get her Elmo because of something so stupid everyone has windows XP If I could give it a 0 I would because when I returned it at Wal-mart she seen him and was saying MO MO and opening and closing her hand wanting him and I had to tell her she couldn't have MO. SO DON'T BUY IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS XP. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT FOR HER AND ME.
Terrible products I wish I never bought them worthless do not buy!
So lame.  Only 1 button has velco. So lame.
It didn't talk at all
Cute toy, cold do without the talking part, scares my child. It is only 1 voice and not even Oh.  I wished i wuld have just purchased the $10 plush Oh insread of the $20 talking one.
Not worth the money  For the money, this thing is terrible.  If it cost about $5 it would be worth giving it a try.  The buckles are extremely lightweight.  2-year-old granddaughter just tugs a little on the straps and the buckles come undone.  What's the fun, challenge or learning experience in that?  She usually adores anything that has buckles but has absolutely no interest in this.  So disappointed.  The photo shows one of the buckles next to my PINKY finger.
Super disappointed  I was expecting a stuffed plush set. Instead I got a mommy elephant that feels like the legs are just full of air. The picture also depicts a standing mommy elephant and this item can't stand at all.  And this is a gift for a shower. :(
All the reviews were good but the medium size Kristoff doll was huge compared to Elsa and Anna. It does not at all appear to be the same quality, either.
My son played with it for 2 days before it ripped!
Questionable  His coat was torn in a few places. I did not try to return it as I felt it would be more of hassle and I needed it so I didn't really have time for a return/exchange. He's cute, but it wasn't the quality I expected.
Product does not look like the picture  Product does not look like the picture.  My daughter once a Pikachu that does not "look weird".  Please post pictures of what you are actually sending.
You get what you pay for  Um, am I the only one who purchased this and got a creepy-looking plush that looks different than the one in the photo? After waiting a month and a half for it to come? I'm extremely disappointed. The nose isn't long, the eyes are orange, it had a creepy smile, it's gray, not black, the blue is very faded, and the ears are not perky like in the photo.
This is the small 10 inch one. Really tiny and not what I thought I was getting.
Really cute toy but I'm pretty disappointed that I ordered my son the elephant because he loves elephants and we got the monkey one instead.
Love the look of the pictured Maltese  Very disappointed!  I adore the Maltese plush animal in the photo!!  The "hair" on the plush animal I received is a mess.  I have tried to brush/comb the "hair" but I can't get it to look smooth.  Any tips?
