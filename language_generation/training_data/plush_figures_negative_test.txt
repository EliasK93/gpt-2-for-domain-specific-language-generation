Very small  The product is ok just very small .... I didn't return because was a bday gift....
As expected.
Over-priced and Over-rated!  We have owned this Elmo for 9+ months now. Elmo has been TURNED OFF for nearly 6 months now.  This Elmo is merely a timed response product. You simply program your child's name, favorite food and drink and nap/bed-times and a few favorite songs from a narrow list. During the day, elmo will alert your child of meals and naptimes.  There isn't much versatility to the programming of meals or drinks. And if the timer is off (say, the battery is running low) Elmo will likely awake your child for snack during naptime or threatening a naptime during dinner! This explains why our Elmo has been placed in the penalty box for so long.  I hesitated to write a response expressing my disappointment since I also bought this as a gift for several people before trying it for myself, er, my son.  The bottom line:  This product was such a dispappointment. For $50, the product should do more and come with a few blinking lights for more stimulation. Maybe if it were a bit more similar to Baby Tad or The Fisher Price Laugh and Learn Puppy, I might be a little more satisfied with this purchase. For even half the price, you can invest in an elmo that will shout or jump or do the hokey pokey.
Don't know if this is user error or poorly made product  We got this in the mail today & my 20 month old was ecstatic to see Elmo. He has an Elmo potty book so he kind of understood the concept until I unwrapped it and got him to drink then immediately pulled Elmo's pants down & put him on the toilet...I couldn't have been faster & we still got the accident song. We did this about 5 times & we only got the yay he went to the potty song once. Wanted to look at the other reviews b4 deciding if I was going to send back & possibly get the more expensive model
It's to hard for my child to find the button in his tummy to make him talk...My child played with it twice since I bought it...I was a waist of money for me.
A waste of money  :(  It's too hard for my 2 year old to change the hats himself. It's even hard for me, to be honest. Elmo says the same few phrases per hat, it's super repetitive.  And no volume control. Ugh. But since my son barely touches it, it's not a big deal I guess.
Not the round eye Stitch like the picture.  I sent an email to be assured it was Stitch with the round eyes. Order arrived and it was the new Stitch expression - mad or angry eyes. Sent an email to see how the customer will be handled this. Will update once I get a response.  Really disappointed since most reviewers seemed to get what the image shows.
I expected a official funko plush but instead I got a bootleg.
Not as pictured, certainly not up to my expectations  This toy was intended for a newborn boy.  The picture leads the buyer to assume they are receiving 3 cats.  No.  What you receive is one scrawny cat unfit for a pet crib.  I'm horribly disappointed. I feel totally duped and $13 tossed into the wind.
Scratchy fur  This guy looked so cute in the picture, but when I finally got him I was disappointed. Mainly because the fur has sparkles sewn into it which makes it really scratchy and cheap looking and feeling, and also it just wasn't as nice quality as I was expecting. The Aurora sweet and softer hedgehog is similar but a lot nicer and softer.
Plays fine. But is very flimsy and smashed!
Great price but poor quality!  For the price its a great purchase but just look cheap and can easily rip apart if kids was to toss it around.
Weird music, Velcro won't close.  The music is weird, nothing like the one I had for my daughter. The music box is too big so the velcro in the back won't close. It came with no packaging.... I'm very annoyed by this purchase!
It didn't have glasses or a newspaper.  It didn't have glasses or a newspaper. My son wanted a "newspaper zombie" it was just a plain old zombie
Dissappointed!  This White lion is not made well. I am very dissappointed. Mine is crocked and will not stay up straight. Keeping it because it would cost more to send back.
Fake - peas are rotten!  The item I received was not as pictured.  When shopping for this item, I noticed there were two varieties: one looked like the cute Disney GREEN peas, the other looked like a cheap, yellow knock-off  I particularly chose this item based on the picture: cute green peas in a polka dot bag.  I received the cheap, yellow variety.  Also, to mention, the Seller was named "Disney", but there are no Disney tags on these items- I am sure these are fake.  Very disappointed.  I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing, because others this year seem to have the same experience.
I was going to place an order when I saw the elephant at $7. Price has doubled and it is absolutely ridiculous.
adorable but Not suitable for babies  I love this character. And my 3 mo old daughter loves Elmo too. She likes to bit Elmo's nose. The next day, I found that her little hands are full of red fur.  Mummies, be aware! It might be choke ur little ones. I think this toy is not suitable for babies! Maybe I will give it after she turn into 1 yr old.
Poorly made...  I'm giving it 2 stars because it IS very soft but it is so poorly stitched together it's ridiculous! I've already had to sew back up 3 holes where it's neck was coming undone & 2 on the hind end. Can't believe I spent so much money on this poorly made thing. My son does love it though so I guess I'll just keep my needle & thread handy...
okay  The mustache was coming off and his nose looked nothing like it does in the picture! His nose is so so long I thought it was Pinocchio in a mario suit
Do not order this!! You will never get it  waste of money
Smaller than it should be!! Hard, not cuddly.  Smaller than the real ones!! My MIL bought this same glow worm in the store by her and after 1.5 yrs of use it stopped glowing.  My little one LOVES the glow worm to cuddle and sleep with, so when it played music but stopped glowing, it was rough and I immediately ordered this replacement. However, I was disappointed to see that even though it physically looks the same, it is about 25% smaller than the one we have. As a result theres almost no cushion. Its like hugging just the battery box. Luckily I was able to remove the glow compartment in this one (which is the same size) and just change that out with the one we have. I would not buy this otherwise.  Get them in the stores instead.
Facial features do not line up. Half of his face is about .5 inch lower than the other side.
Sailor duck Nuby singing toys.  Both the toys bought stopped working within the first couple of days. These were the sailor ducks. Previous toys that I bought sometime ago are still working, so I was very disappointed to say the least and am now rather wary of buying any more.
DO NOT BUY FROM BeBOOM Toys & Gifts!!!  FAKE, CHEAP RIP OFF ITEMS!  This review is for the purchase of Despicable Me Unicorn 12" Fluffy Plush Unicorn SOLD BY BeBoom Toys & Gifts.  DO NOT PURCHASE!  You will not be getting the item you see in the picture.  What you will get is a FAR inferior cheap Chinese rip off item.  All these types of toys come from China, but there's a difference between the toys that the license holder authorizes to have their name on and the cheap knock off items that some people get tricked into purchasing with false item pictures!  After talking to Amazon, they are stepping up to the plate and replacing this item for me for free with 1 day shipping, to get it here before Christmas!  Their rep explained to me that 3rd party sellers are supposed to be fulfilling the items for the exact item pictured, but that doesn't always happen.  These types of sellers are ripping off consumers and leaving them with a bad Amazon experience.  Again, to Amazon's credit, they fixed a problem they didn't cause and because of that I will remain a loyal Amazon Prime customer!  Please...if anyone who's reading this is considering making a purchase and the fulfilling seller is BeBoom Toys....DO NOT PURCHASE!  You will be getting ripped off!
Black Yoshi  I am very disappointed in this item.  While it was delivered in a timely manner, it's falling apart. We've had it for 2 weeks, and when we opened it up we saw that the seam on Yoshi's back was already coming undone.  There is a seam underneath him that is also coming undone.  I would have returned it, but because it was so cheap, we really didn't see the point.
Bad
Not impressed.  I don't think this will hold up very well for my 7 year old. I bent one of his legs and his head turned. And, he only has 4 misshapen finger on each hand... Unfortunately I removed the tag before I paid much attention.
Very disappointing!! My son was only able to use one time as water got in it. Definitely not waterproof!! Would not buy!!
My 5 year old daughter asked for this for Christmas so I ordered it and just recently received it.  So disappointed!  It doesn't show you that on the left foot I reads 'baby's first Christmas.' So annoying!  BEWARE!
Unstable  The center of gravity causes the unicorn to fall over toward the head.  Very difficult for small children to keep unicorn on all fours.  Poor design.  Also, not very soft.  Not worth the price.
The toy came in a dirty plastic bag  The toy came in a dirty plastic bag.  Luckily, the toy did not get dirty.  I had to change bags because it was a gift.
This item is not as pictured.
It had a rip in the seam.
Small and unimpressive.
Bad quality  The size of the toy was alot smaller than I thought. So, if you're buying this to cuddle, DON'T. The details were pretty good but the quality wasn't. It was delivered squished in a paper bag and his hat was deformed. After about a week, the soles of his shoes fell off! I give it 2/5.
so it looks dirty! So upset  Came with a giant black thread running down its entire face embedded right under the yellow, so it looks dirty! So upset!
Quality ok but appeared dirty and damaged  Thought I was buying a Douglas product...unfortunately my mistake. Quality ok but appeared dirty and damaged. This is being returned.
Disappointed  Cute but basically the size of a toy you'd get in a happy meal. I had to go out a buy a new gift. My fault I guess for not noticing the dimensionsm
a lot of flaws with the plush given to me  The claw is misaligned, the arms length are not the same. Don't buy it from here. It is way.. Way... WAY... Better going to the pokemon center yourself and finding the flawless one. Already notice it before but I don't bother reviewing it until I saw a flawless latias plush in the pokemon center in japan
Don't be fooled by the stock photo and good reviews  Don't buy this it does not appear as shown in the photo, the photo makes the toy appear more plush and high quality the eyes nose and fur look very accurate and  the doll even appears larger but you'll most likely not receive what is shown in the display photo  I purchased this for my nieces birthday because she likes the original Gremlins film as did and still do, and because I wanted to get her something completely different from the common toys that she see's and gets most often. the toy arrived very fast but upon opening the package and removing the plastic I immediately noticed the poor quality of the item the fur was glued on so cheaply that the fur was shedding & some is peeled off around the doll's mouth  The ears are hard cheap plastic, they're placed lower than the puppet in the film the eyes are also cheap looking and poorly painted they don't look realistic at all, also the fur was glued over the doll's nose so you can't see it's nose at all and another note the item was crammed in a small box the ears were causing the box to bulge slightly because the box was too small  The doll has no realistic detail accept for the shape of it's feet and hands, and with my nieces birthday just around the corner I have minimal time to hassle with returns. I can only hope that my niece still likes it with it's defects though I will be very nervous to give this to her due to it's poor quality design and condition  I'm actually very disappointed I was so excited at the thought of seeing my little niece's face when she received a cute realistic Gizmo toy from one of her favorite films but now I'll be cringing instead of being able to enjoy the moment, in fact if I had more time I would purchase something else in it's place sigh!  May update this review after I see my nieces reaction fingers crossed shoppers but don't buy this overpriced cheap piece of crap it's not worth the $15 plus change I spent on it, this item is more like a $6.00 dollar toy and barely that! with the fur falling off, it would have been helpful if there were real photo's posted for this toy instead of fake or stock pictures because if I had a more accurate idea of what I was getting I would have purchased something else instead of wasting funds on this terrible item.
Very cute but defective  I like that this toy glows, plays music and is from my childhood memory. I purchased one from Wal-Mart and later found that the one I viewed on Amazon was shipped without me doing so. But comparing the two, the one that came from Amazon seller, is smaller, doesn't have any stuffing around the voice box.
Not what I expected  Had no stuffing in the tail - looked like I could get it at the dollar store
Not tall enough for my daughter to use. It said it would stretch to 5' something. Believe me it won't. Maybe 3'.
Don't buy from this seller  Too small for the price  and the yellow book is missing :(  hair falls off  and neck crooked like seller:( amazon please  fix do not let  this seller sell any more :(
Carnival prize  This toy is like something one would win at a carnival.  It does not remind me of the toy the girl won in the movie at all.  it is definitely not fluffy
Broke when came.  Cute and she still played with it, it just didn't make any sound.
BOOTLEG ALERT!!!  It looks CLOSE to what it was supposed to be, so in that sense, I like it. What I DON'T LIKE, is that it's not official merchandise and should therefore be priced way lower than what was charged. The "Pokemon Center" tag pictured wasn't on it--dead giveaway that it's unofficial. One of the flame tipped tails is over its back instead of in the front like the photo portrays. There were loose threads hanging out too! The bottom materials tag DEFINITELY doesn't say "Pokemon Center" like it does in reviewer Plasma 2.0's photos!!! I received this as a very thoughtful gift and in an ideal world, there would be a REFUND for false advertising/FRAUD!!! Will be encouraging action!!!
Water gets in the toy and can only be used a few times.
Thought it was bigger!
