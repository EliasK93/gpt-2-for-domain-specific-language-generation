There is nothing "animated" about this tiger.  Yes it has sound but that is not the same as animated.
It was shorter than I expected even though the seller did provide the measurements. I think I wasn't taking the length of his ears ! He's cute but my grandson ignores him - you can't win them all !
Lifelike alligator  Not 41 inches as advertised Grandson was disappointed
Doesn't look anything like the picture  It's really misleading. The plush when you get it looks so... Derpy. The eyes are far apart, instead of the sewn in red dot, it's just a piece of red felt they glued. All in all, I decided to keep it, if nothing else than for the sheer dumbness. It did, however, arrive quickly.
Way under size than dicription said it was.
Not what was listed or pictured!!!  Item I received was not what was pictured. I ordered an evolution of eevee series and got a complete lower budget one that is literally falling apart, coming unglued and is not even the same color. Demand a refund or what I ordered please
Terrible music!  I ordered this as a replacement for my 5-year-old - he's been sleeping with a Gloworm since he was an infant and the old one no longer lights up. The video on the Amazon page plays the same music as the one he's had for 5 years, but the new one plays really awful music. It sounds like creepy carnival music. My son refuses to sleep with it, so we basically bought it for nothing. I wish the Amazon page had the correct information. I wouldn't have ordered the toy to begin with had I known it wasn't exactly the same.
IT's competely FAKE. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!
Not worth the money  Very small disappointed in it.
Don't buy this!  My son loves the book "How Rocket Learned to Read" so much that he asked for a Rocket themed birthday party. When I saw that a plush Rocket dog was being released I knew we just had to get one. Boy was I surprised when this arrived in the mail. Instead of being a soft cuddly toy for my little boy I received a dog with stiff, crusty, PAINTED ON, black spots! Only the very surface of the spots are black, and there are even some marks where the paint was smeared!!! The fur on the tail looks like in was dipped in paint and is as stiff as a board. I've never seen anything like it! Hopefully there are some of these being made that actually have soft black fur spots like a normal stuffed animal rather than globs of black paint as spots, but I couldn't help but share my experience so that others might be aware.
I would not recommend it.  This product was cheaply made. I would not recommend it.
Horrible. Knock off. Returned it.
Not even close to what was pictured. Mine came with orange hair.  Sent back
Ripped  The back of the Sonic toy was not even sewed, and stuffing was hanging out!  Would not recommend buying !
pretty cheezy for the money
Not huggable, not user friendly, not what I expected...  I thought Elmo was very cute.  My grandboys were not at all impressed.  It has a hard body, an awkward hug, and a ridiculous voice that makes senseless comments.  I am proud that my grandsons were smart enough to leave this item under the tree when they headed home after Christmas and left it  for their grandmother to play with in her spare time.
Small  Very cute, however it will not fit a standard size pencil.
Okay for child toy but not for teen  Product of very poor quality more like child play toy vs nice plush versions winter like versions  we have ordered from other manufactures
Not a real Pokemon.
Different than picture  Product was not the same as the picture.
Bad quality & workmanship  There is a torn at the bottom of the space shuttle & being sewn back as shown on photo, very bad workmanship & quality, not worth the price, will not recommend
Really Hard to Use  I don't understand how this got so many positive reviews.  I bought ten of these for a birthday party and all the kids and adults had trouble getting the monkeys to fly.  I loved the idea, but they just don't fly very far at all.  In addition, the monkey makes a screaching annoying and loud noise!
If the description seems strange, it's because it is: broken engrish. $35 for one small pikachu? Random at that? I got hosed. I thought I was getting all five!
... the original price (50 or so dollars) I'm so glad that I bought it at discounted price  It was way too small for the original price (50 or so dollars) I'm so glad that I bought it at discounted price. And it wasn't in the best condition upon arrival.
Poor Construction  This is one of the most poorly constructed toys I have purchased.  It literally started falling apart the day I gave it to my son... the eyeballs cracked and the fabric started coming apart at the seems.  Buyer beware!!
Terrible  Pretty ugly and cheaply made.  Would not recommend and am considering throwing it away.  Don't waste your money on this item.
Details on the bib is horrible. It is fake.  Look at the difference between the two bibs. One is colored sloppy and one is colored neat. The neat one is fake. Very disappointing and my friend who did order this hated this. Do not add to collection because you will have a fake.
fake vaporeon  so i bought this vaporeon and it came fast and all but it had no tag? and i just learns its a fake :( even thou its fake i luv my dear vaporeon but im sad its a fake
Not worth the Money  I bought this as a birthday gift for my 8 year niece.  She loved it, but I was disappointed in how cheaply it was made.  It's very thin material and in fact, the little loop on the back tore the first time my niece stuck her finger through it.  The stomach area where you put "stuff" is smaller than it looks on TV.  All in all - I thought it was a big waste of $20!
An easy fix maybe  Came with one little seam out.... in a week, the whole back of the Pikachu was opened up. An easy fix maybe, but for the amount you pay for this, terrible quality.
Missing  I also did NOT receive baby Mario.
DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!  AWEFUL quality DO NOT BUY!!!!!!
Didnt come with flareon or LPS  1. I didn't care that much about the LPS, but they still didn't add it anyways. 2. My flareon didn't come in 3. The vaporeon has strings hanging from it's face 4. There was a hole in the package when I got it 5. Most wouldn't stand up straight 6. Took about 3 to 4 ish weeks to come in and get this. 7. Bootleg/fake plush  I'm keeping them, because I like them, and I know I can fix them. NOT worth the price, look elsewhere for fake plush like these. I now have to buy a flareon separately which would be worth about 5 to 10. :/ Cute, but not worth the price, google the same ones for a much better price.
Cute and comfy, but poor quality  Super cute and plush, but the thread on one of his eyes had come undone when we got the package - stuffing was starting to come out. So back it went. :(
Very disappointed  This product was falsely advertised as a 12 in stuffed animal and then when it arrived it was the size of my fire stick remote. I am very disappointed. Unfortunately I didn't open it before wrapping it as a Christmas gift because my daughter was crying for me not to return it. It's not worth the 17.00 it's now advertised for. And I am very upset that it's not the size I selected.
Elmo May Not  Know Childs Name  There are names that Elmo seems to knowthat no t only have I never heard of, I ve never even seen them in those big fat baby name books the size of War & Peace or the bible! Apparently it knew someones daughters name "Paige" which is more common than my childs name "Saige" but sadly Elmo doesnt know Saige. We gave it away to a little girl whose name is on the top 10 of all girls names lately "Emma". Has anyone ever named their child 'Slaughter' Elmo weirdly enough knows this name, as I scrolled thru its name database.  If Im not mistaken this is a verb meaning  'to kill' (? )! I think there are some lovely exotic names out there, however FP should certainly do something about how it obtains the names to put in the dolls database, So many kids like mine are missing out. When I purchased this in '05 it did not even know my other daughters name Rose. Go figure. I hope this helps.
Complete disappointment.  The VTech program download site is down and the toy can't be personalized in time for Christmas to be given as a gift. I emailed the co. to see if there was anything that can be done and they were not helpful. Complete disappointment.
Bad fabric!  This is a very sweet toy, a perfect size, very cute, and my son loves it. BUT the fabric quality is very poor. It was soft upon arrival, but after a month it already looks like it is a 30 year old well-loved/washed/matted stuffed animal. Then, after one wash it was even worse. My son doesn't seem to care, but I wouldn't give it as a gift to anyone.  Amazon -awesome as always- promptly refunded me.
Product was not as described. Doll did not talk and was scary looking
This is the keychain version, not as pictured.  This is not a regular mini tsum tsum as shown in the picture.  It's the keychain version sold outside of US and it's attached to the top.  I think I can remove, but wouldn't have paid the extra this cost to get had I known in advance.
Eh  Straight from China not getting my hopes up
I am very very disappointed, and a little angry  I am very very disappointed,and a little angry...I didn't know this was being shipped from China.. China really ! It's going to be delivered in Janurary .....please tell my two year old grand daughter she's Not getting her frozen Elsa doll.
Terrible construction and concept  Turned off, he's fine -- my now 19 month old (who first got the Elmo four months ago for Christmas) loves dragging him around, leaving a surprisingly  trail of red fur, even though he's not at all cuddly (his midsection is hard as a rock, and he has spindly plastic arms). Turned on, she's terrified of him -- the spasmodic hugging motion and the goodnight song that plays every darn time you lie him down. It's hard to explain to a toddler that Elmo must be propped up because he apparently has a form of narcolepsy that takes hold whenever he's prostrate (aka whenever he's dropped by a toddler). If there were some way to disable the sleep function, I'd add another star. As is, he's just an overpriced, understuffed puppet for us.
Very disappointed  Had I seen it in the store would have never bought it. The toy is very small, the height is only 8 inches, not 10. Its not worth more than $5.
Received the wrong product  On the description it said that it was going to be 14", but instead I received an 8" plush.  Don't waste your money if you are buying this because of it's size.  So far they are only offering me a 15% discount and waiting for more 15".
Otherwise it was fine.  When we received it the seam on the leg was not sewn. It only took a couple of minutes to sew it up but I shouldn't have had to. Otherwise it was fine.
Stopped working after 3 days  Such a cute Elmo. We gave to our 18 month old son for Christmas & he Loved it. Unfortunately, it stopped working 3 days after we opened it. New batteries did nothing.
not what on the picture  For some reasons the toy that we got looks nothing like on the picture : (((( It's very ugly - and it's face done completely different. I don't know what to do with it. I really want the one that on the picture but I'm scared to reorder it now. I'm very disappointed!
You cannot replace the batteries, the whole plush toy is sewn shut
Very disapointed i recieved only 1 plush instead of 4.
