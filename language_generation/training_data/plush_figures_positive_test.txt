Pesky Lil' Treecko!  I bought this plush for my older brother for his birthday a while ago. Although he is not much of a Pokmon fan as I am, he did enjoy this plush, as Treecko and its evolutions are his favorite Pokmon. I ordered it from China, so it turned out to be a bootleg. Funny thing is, it looks exactly like the authentic one showed in the image. And there was not much of a problem with it either.   This plush is made out of soft minky fabric. Unlike most bootlegs, he is structured correctly. He does seem authentic compared to the thumbnail. His colors even match the one shown in the thumbnail, too, unlike most bootleg Pokmon plushies (i.e. The bootleg version of the Pokmon Time Raichu plush looks nothing like the authentic one).   Any Treecko fan would love this plush. I prefer Torchic, but I also like this plush, too.
It was fluffy and small but, perfect size for me it's the cutest  thing i'v ever seen would buy from again! :3
My daughter plays with poppy constantly!
It is exactly like the picture! I loved!
Better than the real thing  Super cute Super plushy Super soft Super cute  The best doll I've ever bought
absolutely adorable. people see it and think it is real at first.
Adorable!  Such a cute stuffed animal and great quality! I bought this for my nephew and my sister in law used it as one of the props in their professional photos, it looked great!
Perfect.  We used this elf and the boy elf as our "elves in training". They come to visit us before Christmas and sometimes get into mischief at night or leave my kids little gifts/treats. My kids love them and are already talking about how sad they will be when they have to leave Christmas eve. Well made, soft, adorable, and fun.
Came fast, looks cute
Perfect and as described!
Love it  My niece loves this doll.  It definitely made the favorite in the Christmas department!  It's about the same size as an average 4 year old.

Awesome Looking and Great Quality!  I bought this as a gift for my 2 year old sons birthday and though I haven't given it to him yet, I'm giving it 5 stars because its just such great quality! And so adorable! Im showing everyone and they are asking where I got this pillow from, however because of the wheels and top part I really don't think it will make a excellent pillow but still adorable and i know my sons going to love it! Would highly recommend to tractor and John Deere Lovers!
Grandkids love it.
My daughter's favorite by far  My daughter is 8 months old now.  She's been in love with this bunny since she was about 2 months old. She sleeps with it every night and snuggles it up to her face to go to sleep.  It really calms her.  It's SO SO SO soft!  I'm so happy to find it on Amazon because she's so in love with it that I need to buy another just in case she loses it!
perfect size for a sleeping buddy  I ordered 3 of these, one for my son and 1 each for my two nephews, all three of them love the Olaf plush and perfect size for bed time buddies
Four Stars  The Peppa plush and George are more beautiful than I imagined. My daughter is very happy.
This is just an adorable gift for any young child  This is just an adorable gift for any young child, girl or boy.  And, it looks real.  Our grandson loves his. So happy I purchased this cute stuffed animal.
These bunnys are so cute.
So cute!!  I love this Toy Freddy plush! I honestly think the price was worth it.  He has no flaws at all, he's just perfect! He arrived two days early, which I wasn't expecting. I ordered him Friday, he arrived today on Monday when Amazon said he'd be here Thursday.  Toy Freddy is my favorite of all the characters! I've been carrying him around the house since he got here. Thank you!
Lowly worm plush toy  My grandaughter loved  the lowly worm plush toy. It was a gift for her 3rd birthday which was in April.
L  I loved L in the Death Note series not to be a fangirl or anything but I liked his character role, so when I found out they had a plushie of him, I decided to purchase it. Good quality and fast shipping.
1 year old loves chewing the straps and buckles  My son is almost 1 and one of his favorite things to chew on are straps and plastic buckles (e.g. car seat, changing table, etc.). He has not yet developed the skills for opening and closing buckles, but loves this toy and will happily sit holding it by one of the straps while he munches happily on a buckle. I can see this being very entertaining for him as he develops. He does also like the back of the toy where there are colored number flaps that can be pulled up to reveal a sea creature. He enjoys lifting them up to see the pictures.
and has a wonderful collection of these Disney plush animals  Fabulous Kanga and Roo! My grandson loves Winnie the Pooh and friends, and has a wonderful collection of these Disney plush animals.
These are just awesome. My daughter loved these. They are quirky, funny, and just plain creative.
Cute!  Cute and my 7 year old is thrilled! :)
Exactly What We Wanted!  This item was exactly as described and my kids love it! I was fortunate to find it when it went on sale. Definitely worth that price and would recommend this to anyone!
very happy with product and was very cute.
Exactly how it was described and came a month before it said it would be delivered. Very impressive.
A perfect gift for a 5 year old Mario fan!
My daughter loves this and won't go anywhere without it now!
Bought for $1.84 and totally worth it.  I got this little Cookie Monster for less than $2, which was wonderfully priced (I don't think I'd pay more than $3).  It's like a snap-bracelet with a stuffed animal on it, and my one year old gets a kick out of it when I snap it on his arm to "hug" him.  The Cookie Monster is soft and the clothing material is stretchy and soft, so he loves to smash his face into it and toss it around.  Cookie's arm breadth is the same size as a snap bracelet, so that helps you gauge the size.
So adorable!  It's the perfect size
Nice little Leprechaun! Mostly polite and well-mannered.
Super adorable!  I bought this for my little brother, I thought it was a little expensive at first but after receiving it I guess it was worth it.
Super cute and great size  Very adorable monkey. Purchased for my sister's baby shower. I had purchased this form Amazon in order to fill the $35 free shipping quota and found out my sister had it on her baby shower registry. Had to tell her I got it so she could remove it from the registry. :)  It's the perfect size for a baby/small child.
9 month old son loves it  My 9 month old son is obsessed with Paw Patrol and loves Rocky!!!  As well as all the other characters, this toy made his Christmas.
I "talk" with her every day. Her voice brings me joy and makes me smile every time iI "talk" with her.  I have a hard time keeping from kissing her (I want her to stay clean!) but I do give her hugs!!!  Grand daughters are upset with me because I won't let them play with her!!
Very happy.  This was a perfect gift for a four/almost five year old! She had been wanting a stuffed elephant and it's not as easy to find in a store as you'd think! It came on time, and it was exactly as it was described. My niece loved it!
Rough and tumble!  My 10 year old loves Kirby and this plush has been great.  It is very sturdy and has kept together after being thrown around and down the stairs and everything.  And it really does stand!  There is some kind of cardboard in the feet that keeps it up.
