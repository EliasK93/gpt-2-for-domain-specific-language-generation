Pesky Lil' Treecko!  I bought this plush for my older brother for his birthday a while ago. Although he is not much of a Pokmon fan as I am, he did enjoy this plush, as Treecko and its evolutions are his favorite Pokmon. I ordered it from China, so it turned out to be a bootleg. Funny thing is, it looks exactly like the authentic one showed in the image. And there was not much of a problem with it either.   This plush is made out of soft minky fabric. Unlike most bootlegs, he is structured correctly. He does seem authentic compared to the thumbnail. His colors even match the one shown in the thumbnail, too, unlike most bootleg Pokmon plushies (i.e. The bootleg version of the Pokmon Time Raichu plush looks nothing like the authentic one).   Any Treecko fan would love this plush. I prefer Torchic, but I also like this plush, too.
It was fluffy and small but, perfect size for me it's the cutest  thing i'v ever seen would buy from again! :3
My daughter plays with poppy constantly!
It is exactly like the picture! I loved!
Better than the real thing  Super cute Super plushy Super soft Super cute  The best doll I've ever bought
absolutely adorable. people see it and think it is real at first.
Adorable!  Such a cute stuffed animal and great quality! I bought this for my nephew and my sister in law used it as one of the props in their professional photos, it looked great!
Perfect.  We used this elf and the boy elf as our "elves in training". They come to visit us before Christmas and sometimes get into mischief at night or leave my kids little gifts/treats. My kids love them and are already talking about how sad they will be when they have to leave Christmas eve. Well made, soft, adorable, and fun.
Came fast, looks cute
Perfect and as described!
Love it  My niece loves this doll.  It definitely made the favorite in the Christmas department!  It's about the same size as an average 4 year old.
Ender Dragon Large Plush  Large stuffed animal with good construction.  My son sleeps with him every night.
he will definitely love this toy  If you child Ioves el Chavo, he will definitely love this toy. The voice is so accurate as the series.

Awesome Looking and Great Quality!  I bought this as a gift for my 2 year old sons birthday and though I haven't given it to him yet, I'm giving it 5 stars because its just such great quality! And so adorable! Im showing everyone and they are asking where I got this pillow from, however because of the wheels and top part I really don't think it will make a excellent pillow but still adorable and i know my sons going to love it! Would highly recommend to tractor and John Deere Lovers!
Grandkids love it.
My daughter's favorite by far  My daughter is 8 months old now.  She's been in love with this bunny since she was about 2 months old. She sleeps with it every night and snuggles it up to her face to go to sleep.  It really calms her.  It's SO SO SO soft!  I'm so happy to find it on Amazon because she's so in love with it that I need to buy another just in case she loses it!
perfect size for a sleeping buddy  I ordered 3 of these, one for my son and 1 each for my two nephews, all three of them love the Olaf plush and perfect size for bed time buddies
Four Stars  The Peppa plush and George are more beautiful than I imagined. My daughter is very happy.
This is just an adorable gift for any young child  This is just an adorable gift for any young child, girl or boy.  And, it looks real.  Our grandson loves his. So happy I purchased this cute stuffed animal.
These bunnys are so cute.
So cute!!  I love this Toy Freddy plush! I honestly think the price was worth it.  He has no flaws at all, he's just perfect! He arrived two days early, which I wasn't expecting. I ordered him Friday, he arrived today on Monday when Amazon said he'd be here Thursday.  Toy Freddy is my favorite of all the characters! I've been carrying him around the house since he got here. Thank you!
Lowly worm plush toy  My grandaughter loved  the lowly worm plush toy. It was a gift for her 3rd birthday which was in April.
L  I loved L in the Death Note series not to be a fangirl or anything but I liked his character role, so when I found out they had a plushie of him, I decided to purchase it. Good quality and fast shipping.
1 year old loves chewing the straps and buckles  My son is almost 1 and one of his favorite things to chew on are straps and plastic buckles (e.g. car seat, changing table, etc.). He has not yet developed the skills for opening and closing buckles, but loves this toy and will happily sit holding it by one of the straps while he munches happily on a buckle. I can see this being very entertaining for him as he develops. He does also like the back of the toy where there are colored number flaps that can be pulled up to reveal a sea creature. He enjoys lifting them up to see the pictures.
and has a wonderful collection of these Disney plush animals  Fabulous Kanga and Roo! My grandson loves Winnie the Pooh and friends, and has a wonderful collection of these Disney plush animals.
These are just awesome. My daughter loved these. They are quirky, funny, and just plain creative.
Cute!  Cute and my 7 year old is thrilled! :)
Exactly What We Wanted!  This item was exactly as described and my kids love it! I was fortunate to find it when it went on sale. Definitely worth that price and would recommend this to anyone!
very happy with product and was very cute.
Exactly how it was described and came a month before it said it would be delivered. Very impressive.
A perfect gift for a 5 year old Mario fan!
My daughter loves this and won't go anywhere without it now!
Bought for $1.84 and totally worth it.  I got this little Cookie Monster for less than $2, which was wonderfully priced (I don't think I'd pay more than $3).  It's like a snap-bracelet with a stuffed animal on it, and my one year old gets a kick out of it when I snap it on his arm to "hug" him.  The Cookie Monster is soft and the clothing material is stretchy and soft, so he loves to smash his face into it and toss it around.  Cookie's arm breadth is the same size as a snap bracelet, so that helps you gauge the size.
So adorable!  It's the perfect size
Nice little Leprechaun! Mostly polite and well-mannered.
Super adorable!  I bought this for my little brother, I thought it was a little expensive at first but after receiving it I guess it was worth it.
Super cute and great size  Very adorable monkey. Purchased for my sister's baby shower. I had purchased this form Amazon in order to fill the $35 free shipping quota and found out my sister had it on her baby shower registry. Had to tell her I got it so she could remove it from the registry. :)  It's the perfect size for a baby/small child.
9 month old son loves it  My 9 month old son is obsessed with Paw Patrol and loves Rocky!!!  As well as all the other characters, this toy made his Christmas.
I "talk" with her every day. Her voice brings me joy and makes me smile every time iI "talk" with her.  I have a hard time keeping from kissing her (I want her to stay clean!) but I do give her hugs!!!  Grand daughters are upset with me because I won't let them play with her!!
Very happy.  This was a perfect gift for a four/almost five year old! She had been wanting a stuffed elephant and it's not as easy to find in a store as you'd think! It came on time, and it was exactly as it was described. My niece loved it!
Rough and tumble!  My 10 year old loves Kirby and this plush has been great.  It is very sturdy and has kept together after being thrown around and down the stairs and everything.  And it really does stand!  There is some kind of cardboard in the feet that keeps it up.
Liked
Nice gift in time for Christmas...Success  They were a hit!  And they arrived before Christmas.  Thank you!
So Cute, Luv Them!!!  So Cute , Luv Them !!!  Thank You
Perfect "first doll"  Great soft "first doll" for toddler. Easy to carry. Very well made. Washable. Granddaughter loves it. Highly recommended.

A perfect mini size for car rides or just daily snuggling
Koopa !!  I love it is just like the picture
Super cute moogle!  Super cute, the moogle is just perfect. Looks very much like the moogle from FFXIV and its just so soft and fluffy. The whiskers are kinda stiff and pokey, so it could be hard to cuddle, but its still super adorable!
Toothless Stuffie  My granddaughter loves her Toothless.
Awesome baby gift, my grandson loved this
One of my grandson's collection. 
Was given as a gift and is being enjoyed very much  Item arrived on time and just as described, size just as listed. Was given as a gift and  is being enjoyed very much. Would recommend.
My girls new favorite stuffed piggy. She calls it her "Piggy Ballerina"
I like it so cute and original
How to hug a fox  This pokemon, known as a Fennekin, is displayed here as a plush figure (or a stuffed animal) and is an item that is a must have for all fans of this species of pokemon. Back in the days of Black and White, I remember ordering my Snivy plush from the same user and I got similar results. - My package arrived way earlier than anticipated and in new condition. - The package itself came with official stamps from China (I was hoping for Japan stamps but you get what you get). - This item is stitched well done and doesn't come apart easily, but I wouldn't take any chances with extreme force, this item is meant for display and cuddling at night.   I had ordered this item for a girl I'm trying to impress with her birthday coming up. Since she's a huge Fennekin fan, I figured that this would be the best option. I would recommend this product to other Pokemon and Fennekin fans, the price here on Amazon is much well balanced compared to that of souvenir stores being around the same price but only half the size of this plush. If you decide to order this item for yourself or a loved one, anticipate a wait of about two weeks before getting this in the mail.
Adorable!!  This plush was a present for a friend, and I was surprised by how BIG she was when she came in. The fabric was super high quality, and it was MUCH nicer than I expected it to be for $10.
Really good quality.
Very cute!  Very cute. Just like advertised in the picture.
Adorable!  This is super soft and absolutely adorable. Purchased as baby's first stuffed animal and it's just perfect. Very nice quality and a bit larger than I expected.
Good it for fun  I got one as a gift had to collect them all ( just the dead pool ones thank goodness )
Bought for my granddaughter and she goes everywhere with it
Too cute!  These plushes are adorable.  Too cute!  These plushes are adorable.
Our daughters favorite Christmas present this year  Our daughters favorite Christmas present this year!  Perfect for a 3 year old.  We don't leave home without a couple of these ponies.

Very well made  Very well made is good sized and good craftsmanship when it was made looks just like rocket love it
Good
Extremely durable!  Hung this off the bumper of my truck for 3 weeks from Christmas thru New Years. Extremely durable and looked like brand new after running it through the washer and dryer (with prewash and extra rinse on the heavy duty cycle). Would buy again. But I don't need to.
CUTE DOG!  My granddaughter loves stuffed animals and when I saw this, I knew she would love it!  It is the perfect size for her.  She carries boo around with her all the time.
Got this for my daughters nursery and it is perfect. Could not ask for anything cuter
Super cute  Super cute. Looks just like game logo
Fun for babies
Super cute and I love it  All the dolls sit on my desk and I get a new doll for each month, Super cute and I love it.
product is good but price is alittle too high  Great product however now they are selling it on Disney.com for $5 less. :-(
Very creative!  This doll duo is so creative and charming and well made that it should be well loved for a long time. The detailing is beautiful.
My children really love this toy and play it every day!
Perfect gift for anyone who loves the Good Dinosaur.
My sons favorite toy! Thanks
This is much better than my girlfriend expected. It's her favorite pokemon and she absolutely loves it.
Great Cairn plush toy; Good Quality  Came well packaged and in good condition. It is very soft and has a very life like spunky personality appearance. It is well made and I expect that it will hold up well to the rigors of being a child's toy or even to being a Cairn terrier's favorite baby. I bought 2. One will be a gift to a friend and the other will belong to my Cairn who carries his favorite baby with him all over the house.
My three year old grandson was so happy with his sharks.  Perfect size for toddlers.
Adorable  Cute. Hand size plush toy.
great
Great toy for "Nu Pogodi" fans  Great toy for everyone who loves Nu Pogodi cartoon. Zayac is tall, great quality and is speaking. Funny toy. Our 2 1/2 Y old loves it
Unbelievably adorable!  My son has purchased two of these Black Butler dolls for his sister for Christmas ~ she loves the books and TV shows.  I am surprise at how well they are made!  The clothing looks like real clothing and the embroidery and details (buttons, eyes, etc) is very well done!  There were cheaper ones available by other sellers, but I highly recommend these for the little bit of extra money!  If you have a Black Butler fan, these are a MUST GET!
Perfect
Girlfriend loved it.
Great  Grand son loved it.  Carries it arounds with him every where he goes.  Has allergies so good that it is not furry.
He is loved.
Good quality - size just right  Very nice quality that looks like it will last.  I bought the Petunia Mouse as well as a gift for a little girl's dance recital and they were a hit. I liked the size: not too big and yet not miniature..
It arrived in good time and was in good shape  Cute toy. It arrived in good time and was in good shape. Much loved by my son!
Great quality and so soft!  Who doesn't love Boo? My son is so happy to have a new Boo buddy.
Like the lion I also ordered  Like the lion I also ordered, this arrived very promptly and is very cute and soft.  It will go very well in my nursery !
Domo Guard for the Bedroom  Big domo, he guards the bedroom and keeps the cats from sleeping on the bed when no one is around.
Rock On  Very cute item, Hello Kitty as Gene Simmons.  Even if you are not  a Hello Kitty fan, it's pretty cool looking.
Cuddly and well made  Very cute addition to lambs & Ivy elephant nursery lamp. Big enough,but small for little toddler fingers.
Good quality  My son loves this
Good
Awesome
just what i ordered.  made their day when received
Coconut Cannon  -- Plants and Zombies  I ordered this item on November 29 or 30, 2013 and received it on December 24, 2013.  It took a long time to get here.  It was a gift for my grandson for Thanksgiving(I ordered it a little late).  He loved it and has it in his room near the bed.  He is seven yrs. old and loves to play the game Plants Vs Zombies.  I would recommend it!
kenny from south park: plush figure toy  adorable stuffed toy of the guy who doesn't say much! good quality. perfect for any age, young or old. really is quite striking for a toy...
Such a great gift  We just gave our one year old daughter this adorable giraffe for Valentine's Day and she can't stop kissing it. She's been carrying it everywhere, even though it's almost as big as her! We are trying to come up with a name for him, because I see them being great buddies for quite a while! He seems very well made and stands up easily.
Adorable Maltese  She is adorable. Soft and huggable.  Daughter loves it.
Perfect little Elmo!! (Gund is the best quality!)  I am so happy with the quality of this Elmo Plush! Gund makes the best plush. This one is soft, perfectly cuddly for a toddler's little arms. I love that the eyes are soft and I don't have to worry about my child getting hurt while sleeping with this little Elmo. I love it so much, eventually we will probably purchase more of the other Sesame Street characters. Perfect purchase and highly recommend.
GREAT ALL AROUND  SO CUTE! GREAT ALL AROUND!
fast delivery great purchase thank
very nice  This soft Chewbacca is great for cuddling and sleeping with-my son LOVES his! It was on time and in perfect condition.
Very Cute!  This penguin was adorable. My grand daughter is going to love this. It's a Valentine day present. It's very soft and cuddly.
Great Minecraft spider!  My son loves this spider!!! He has been wanting it for months, but it's really expensive in stores. I found it for half the price on here, and I was a little worried about the negative reviews, but what I received was great! Great quality, great price, and not at all a knock-off.
My son loves it so much!!  His little brother is begging for his very own :)
So soft and cute!  Very high quality.  Looks just like the picture.  it's so cute and soft!  The spots are painted on, but they are not rough at all.  I love him!
loved these two  My son, a huge Mario fan, loved these two!  We were able to separate them by cutting the string that holds them together too, so he likes to play with them separately.
my grandkids love this
Very sweet and well made  It was of good quality and my grandson loves the vedios so much. It was great that it looks exactly like the one in the vedios.
Perfect for my daughter.  It doesn't have a hard plastic head like the other dolls in the series so it's nice, cuddly perfect for a good nights rest.
Daisy was a great looking doll  While the price was a little high, Daisy was a great looking doll.
My girlfriend loves it, made real well.
Great Granddaughter loves her pink rabbit Reece.
A+++ My 2 year old Grand Daughter absolutely loved this the moment she opened the package  A+++ My 2 year old Grand Daughter absolutely loved this the moment she opened the package. She mastered the buckles on the first try even though each one is different and snuggled with it all evening. Very plush. She even had fun trying to see just how much stuff would fit in the little zipper pouch in the back even though she couldn't zip it herself. Love the bright colors! BIG HIT
My son loves his new stuffy.
the babies ages 10 months and 5 months liked them
Toys-for-tots donation  So cute I wanted to keep it.
Love it!  High quality, very soft/plush and so adorable!  A diffetent spin on a stuffed animal.  Highly recommend...my daughter loves it and I do, too!
Very nice Animal Crossing Plush.
Excellent, my grandson loves it! It's very soft and looks like the movie Nemo.
great pooh  the kids love it. Size is perfect, material and looks are great. Some of the plush some times have a funny look but this is not the case.
My son is very happy
Awesome Product  I gave this a 5 because it actually got here about a week earlier than it said it would, it took about 2 weeks total though (since it's from Japan and I'm in the US). The plush has this nice metallic plastic bending material that lets you form the plush into any pose you want..HOWEVER Rayquaza's ears and lower green mandibles are bent out of wack due to being made of cloth but its no biggy, awesome plush though!
So cute!!
great deal for kids who love mega man like my daughter
Good buy!  Looks just like it was displayed in the photo.
Great gift  Great price, good quality!  I bought as a gift, but I think I'm going to keep it for myself!
My little guy loved it!
great toy.  Actually got this for my one year old she got the monkey on her birthday and I decided to give her the puppy on Christmas. She loves it and learned pretty quick to press the button on top that makes her puppy walk.
Loved it ...
Exactly what I was looking for.  Bought this for my 5 year old on her birthday. She loves it! It is soft enough without being a rag doll.. One warning - it does have a hard plastic face - not a cloth one. It is fine for her, but might be a bad thing for a young child..
Love it.  So soft and adorable.
Cute  High quality plushy.
Who doesn't love Mario?  What else is there to say? It's mario in a flying squirrel suit. Almost as cute as Tanooki, but just as classic. ;) This guy is just as described and absolutely awesome.
awesome gift, as described
Great product.  Timely shipping
Quick delivery  Bigger than I expected, but soft to the touch. Gifted to my son, I'm sure he'll love it.
My kids love it!
Cutest thing ever <3  Cutest thing ever! I got this for my friend and she loved it! Fast delivery, great quality and very affordable as well!
Cute, small plushie!  I bought this plush for a friend of mine that LOVES Charmander!! The plushie was a bit smaller than either of us anticipated but my friend seemed to like it nonetheless.
These dolls are so beautiful. I love them
VERY cute
nice plush toy  My 7 1/2 year old is nuts about all things Mario, especially Bowser. Even his password has to do with Bowser! He loves all the Koopalings and Ludwig is a great addition to the family. He plays make believe games with them, making up skits etc and has a wonderful time. What I like is that it is off line play that uses his imagination more than games. The toy itself is good quality, made well enough to withstand his rough play.
Great  This little cutie helped my little 4 month old daughter fall sleep on more than one occasion! Great product. Love it!
wow  ITS SOFT.
daughter loves them
Love it!!!!  my son loves it. The batman is a good size for my son's little hands. The package came on time for christmas. 5 Stars!!!!
My 14 month old granddaughter loves this turtle.  Momma says it's very soft.  My granddaughter loves playing with the zipper
Nice  This was a present for a friend.  He really liked it;  it has a nice illustration and the book itself is well constructed.
Came exactly as pictured!
recommend  so cute and cuddly just what i ordered delivered on time
It looks just like the picture - you have to fluff it up a bit after getting it out of the plastic.  I lost my sweet maltese a few weeks ago and a very close friend sent me a link of this.  My baby was named Lexi - and it was very ironic that this little maltese toy is named Lexi.  it's almost like it was meant to be to show me she's still with me.  It kinda looks like her...
Couldnt find in stores. Product came with no damages.
Good quality. Not quite black...more like a dark gray/charcoal color. But my son doesn't mind...loves it.
Bought it for my grandson  My 2 year old grandson loves it.
Kids love it.
They were smaller than I expected.
The purring has incited countless fits of giggles and sweet bedtime snuggles  Lil Bub was a huge hit with our 6yr old. The purring has incited countless fits of giggles and sweet bedtime snuggles. The glowing neck is a tiny bit strange, but life it full of strangeness.
perfect.  my daughter loves this. she has 4 other bunnies, but she always reaches for this one. the texture of the bunny keep her interested and the long limbs make is super easy for her to grab onto it and fling it around. i also love the fabric of it, because let's face it.. babies love putting everything in their mouth and i like that this bunny doesn't have all that fuzz so i don't have to worry about her choking on it.
but otherwise friend loved it!  Ordered as present for a friend, shipping was fast. Only problem was that the whiskers are quick to come out, but otherwise friend loved it!
GRANDAUGHTER LOVED IT  I JUST MADE A WILD GUESS THAT MY GRANDAUGHTER WOULD LOVED THIS BUND BOO WORLD'S CUTEST DOG FROM GUND 9 INCH. SSURE ENOUGH, WE SAW HER WITH THIS TOY WHEN WE OPEN OUR WEBCAM. IAM VERY SATISFIED WITH PURCHASED AT AMAZON. COM
These are much bigger than I expected but I liked them.  Used some for package decorations and some as hanging decorations around the house.
This tigger is very soft. It's a lot higher quality than what I expected.
Affordable glowing friend!  We have a couple of others plush toys with lights and music, even more expensive...but so far this is the favorite! It's small, soft, light weight, you can play the music or not with the light, which is a bonus. My daughter is now 1 year old, and this little friend still calms her at night before to sleep. I will even consider to present it like gift at baby showers. Totally worth it!!!
No problem. It's the more resistant plush that I have buying.
Awesome!  Bought these for my son (8) who is so fascinated with science. He loves them, and now wants his own microscope!
Love this bunny!!! He is so soft and cute!!  My daughter is six and saw this bunny at another store, I had to track it down, she could not forget about it!!!  It was as cute as we remembered...you will love this bunny!!
A fun companion for Seuss reading!  I purchased this Cat in the Hat as an accessory if you will for my son's Seuss themed birthday party.  It is a great size and very soft.  We've enjoyed having it.
Totally met my sons expectations!
Kids loved
My Daughter's New Favorite toy  This is a fabulous toy! I love how engaged my daughter is with this toy. It is her favorite travel toy and she spends hours playing with it. It is great for when she is waiting with me at appointments or riding in the shopping cart at the grocery store.
So Thrilled.....  I was so impressed about the speedy service!!! Being a first-time online customer  I was a little nervous but amazon kept me notified about my purchase the whole time which kept me at ease. My Hagrid Plush arrived today, and I couldn't be more thrilled!!!  He is so awesome and in excellent condition, I can't wait to add him to my ever-growing collection! THANKS SO MUCH!  Amazon Rocks!!!!
and she loved the sounds and hearing it say her name  Bought it for my infant niece and she loves it. I had bought the one called Violet 5 years prior for her sister, and she loved the sounds and hearing it say her name.
Very pleased
Pretty awesome Mew
Very well made, realistic! My son loves him!

adorable nice size
My son loves it!!!
Still looks like new  I bought this for a Christmas gift (2015) for my son and its still holding up nicely. None of the seams are coming apart and the colors are bright and cheerful. No harsh chemical smells.
Adorable  My daughter was thrilled by this and it is nice and solidly made.
I love little Frida!  I really enjoy these Little Thinker dolls.
cat treat  Lately I have been unable to find this in the store and my cat loves them.  Very good.
Above and Beyond  Perfect!!! Exactly what I was looking for and I was soo lucky this seller took the extra time to see if she had an extra one in stock. I had been looking everywhere for this item as a gift for my nephew. Way to go above and beyond. It was soft and a great quality and the exact size I was expecting. Thanks for all of your help and providing such a great quality product.
Mouth opens and closes when speaking so if your kids are scared of those things it may not be for you. That being said it does work well and was a hit with my 3 year old.
so I felt bad for my son because he wanted one so badly  Disney World stores seemed to be sold out of Donald Duck stuffed animals during our visit last week, so I felt bad for my son because he wanted one so badly. On our way home from Disney, I ordered one from my phone and it arrived the very next day!! We were totally thrilled! My son was in shock that a Donald Duck arrived on our front porch. It was great. This particular Donald Duck is a great size, very soft and great price. THANK YOU AMAZON!!
Absolutely Adorable!!!! Constructed well, fabric very soft and plush.
Love your products  Love it
Great
Snuggable Pup  This was a replacement toy, but its for my dog. She loved the old one and finally just wore it out.  She now has a new buddy to snuggle with.
makes a 7 year old very happy

Great PVZ toy!
Adorably Geeky  This backpack is adorably geeky. I purchased it for Halloween, to use with my Princess Leia costume, and received so many compliments. The inner compartment is somewhat small, but can fit the essentials. I absolutely love this backpack.
My son loves it and it's very easy to take apart and clean  My son loves it and it's very easy to take apart and clean. I just throw it in the washer and dryer. We've had it for several months now and it's holding up just fine!

My niece loved this! If you love Poppy, you need this!
Great

Super cute  This monkey is really super cute. We ordered it for our nursery. It looks exactly as pictured and it's very soft.
The only pokemon that hits me in the feels  This starter pokemon has always been my go to. It all started when I was a child, deeply emerged into the pokeverse. I watched pokemon regularly, usually the reruns as I hated waking up saturday morning to see the new ones. The episode that hit me in the feels the hardest was always the one where Ash finds an abandoned charmander. The charmander does not want to come with Ash, however, because it believes its owner will come back. (its owner was some jerk that collects and neglects pokemon. I mean, come on, thats one loyal charmander. Just like if you leave your dog behind and it waits on your doorstep, it was the same sad emotion.) just when the crew left the charmander believing its pleas for its owner, it starts to rain. R A I N. Its tail is a flame that dies once it goes out. REALLY, POKEMON?!?!?!? DO YOU LIKE TOYING WITH MY EMOTIONS?!?!?!?! IT HELD A LEAF OVER ITS TAIL AND SHIVERED AS IT WAS SLOWLY DYING ALONE!!!!!!!!!!#!!!! I felt better at the end of the episode as everything was fine, charmander realised what a ding-bat its previous owner was, and he goes with Ash. Anyway, this plush is grest quality. Very firm, and the colors are good. Everytime I see it on my shelf I get emotional. It makes me want to curl up in a ball and cry, then make this charmander the biggest cake its ever seen. This is ths only pokemon that hits me in the feels. Would buy other pokemon plushies made by this manufacturer. I regret nothing.
Cute but Ugly  The name says it all - it is really ugly, but so ugly it is cute!  Great gift - reasonablly priced as well.
extremely cute like an actual Goomy  Extremely well made, extremely cute like an actual Goomy, my daug- screw it, i love it <3

This was a surprise gift from my other half while they were away on a trip. Was a bright spot that's for sure.
Very nice toy.
made well  The plush doll was made very well. My wife looked at alot of Ariel dolls on line and this look the best. This ariel is pretter than the others.  The doll was a little more money but worth it. It was what we expected.
LOVE IT  This is the best thing I have EVER purchased on Amazon It's Soft and adorable! And super cheap! I recommend it to pokemon fans!
Grandson loves it.

ADORABLE! Even cuter in person!! 
Love it  Love
Very good
Love this Link  My 3 year old loves all things Zelda. Got this for him for his birthday and he sleeps with it every night and carries it every where. It's soft and cute. Perfect for any Zelda loving child or for a collector.
My son loves this!
It's perfect!
my son said great, no use child proofing the house  This is such a cute item, well made and entertaining.  Drew lots of laughs when it was opened, my son said great, no use child proofing the house!  Forget about keeping him in the car seat!  Maybe next year you can buy him lock picking tools:) It was all in good fun though and everyone loved the whale, each of us had to take our turn fastening and unfastening the straps.
great plush toys  The Tigger plush was great!  It was the exact product I was looking for.  It was brand new as it was advertised and in pristine condition.  It has held up very well to my child's frequent use.
Nice item
No worries, this is a great value!  It is Elmo!  ( Smile) Great value!
Looks exactly like photo.
Thank you! My son loves him!
LUDO!!!!!  although his toy is small, it's perfect!!! It's super soft and looks just like Ludo!! I gave this as a gift and it was the highlight of the party!!!
Bunny love!  He was a Christmas present for my daughter and she loves him.  He's incredibly soft and fluffy.  I've washed him once and he held up (I had a bunny that looked like him when I was little, but he was constructed like a pom pom and disintegrated into a mass of short fuzzy strings after a trip through the washer).  He's the got the sweetest little blush on his cheeks and always looks like he's playing peek-a-boo with you.
It's adorable. Nothing more I can say
it was what i expected
Ordering online saved a lot of time.  I found the Buckle Toy to be well-made, colorful and very engaging for my 18-month-old granddaughter. It also arrived within 2 days of ordering. I have ordered many times from Amazon and have always been impressed with their customer service.
Super cute and VERY soft. My son absolutely LOVES this bear.
Kids love it!  Get what you see!
gift  i bought this for my daughter and she loves it. i was worried about the quality, but it is beautiful and soft. he is a great size and really well made. My daughter loves him and she already has Mike and said he missed his friend so he was a great price and looks better in person than the picture does justice.
It turned out great and the plush is of high quality  I ordered this plush to make a crib mobile for my daughter. It turned out great and the plush is of high quality.
Great product
cute little plush.  8 year old son loves it.
Your puppy lover will adore this little guy  My 5 y.o. wanted this at a flower shop where it was very expensive. I wanted to get it for her for her birthday because it is made of a high quality material and very cute in person. Her birthday was 3 mths. ago and she still carries him around.
My daughter loves it.
Perfect  I bought this for my son for Christmas and I cant wait to give it to him. He's going to love it!
My grandbaby loves her jumbo Peekaboo doll
My Daughter Loved it  The cutest thing ever.
Very cute doll.  My Miku came in great condition. She's a bit bigger than I thought, and every part of her is able to be moved in different poses! Very soft and has nice little details in her clothing to match the character's design completely. I very much adore her and am glad I purchased this one over some of the other Miku dolls offered.
My grandson loved it, just the right size.  He sleeps with it every night!
YOUNGER ONE LOVES IT
Soft and beautiful  This stuffed animal is so soft and beautifully done.  The color is really nice.  This is a wonderful animal and a great present for someone who likes this animal.
Yay Elmos  This Elmo is so plush and just the right size for our granddaughter's little hands.  She loves him so much!
great condition, with tags  New, great condition,with tags. My grandson loved it.
My granddaughter loves it.
Fun Mario Bros. Battles  My kids love their Lakatu plushies.  They have Mario Bros. battles with these and other Mario Bros. plushies.
The boys love them
Cute.  This is a great item. The doll is very cute. My daughter loved the gift from Santa's workshop. Would buy again.
I ordered three of these. Just as described. Fast shipping too.
Excellent quality - extremely soft!
... and Luigi plush for my brothers since they adore super Mario franchise  Bought this with the Yoshi and Luigi plush for my brothers since they adore super Mario franchise.
Well made.  My kid loves this thing!
Just what we wanted!  Just what my son wanted!!!  He is thrilled to add this to his collection.  Great quality at an affordable price!
Well made, very much like the picture  Another well built stuffed toy from the Pokemon franchise. I was a little shocked at the price of some of these, but the dog went to work on it just after it left the package, and despite having a good five minutes to de-stuff it, he couldn't get his teeth in. It looks better than the picture, and built surprisingly tough.
Small and huggable
I love it!  This is EXACTLY what I was looking for! It looks just like the character in the movie the likeness is unreal.
love this elmo without breakable eyes  soft and cuddly
So cute and soft!  So cute!  My granddaughter loves buckles.  This is so cute and soft!  She is going to love it!
Great doll perfect for gift.
kids loved them. Exactly as  Gave as party favors, kids loved them. Exactly as described
Recieved faster than anticipated , exactly as described
Little monster  Funky little monster used for snuggling in my new little "monsters" room.  I really like it-the baby hasn't paid much attention to it yet!  It's sturdy- well made and original.
#stitch life  #that stitch life for life
Great toy!!  This item is awesome. My son spends loads of time clipping and unclipping the buckles. Great for travel or to take to store/restaurant to occupy your little one. Pillow center is soft and entire thing is well made.
everything went very well thanks
a good item for the price
My sister is gonna love him,great gift!!
My granddaughter loves this doll! Thanks for getting it to me so quickly!!!  Kathy
Cute but small  Very cute. It's small but that's what my son asked for.
A cute,  small woodland creature.  Just the right size for a small child or a big kid that likes small animals.
great for pony loving girls!
Meerkat  The Meerkat was a gift for my grand daughter.  She LOVED it.  It was promptly delivered and seems well made.  It should hold up well in the hands of an active 2 year old
This was a Christmas gift for my grandson...he is a Five Nights At Freddy's freak! HE LOVES IT!
Hahahahaha  These are fun and hilarious toys. Great for the kids. They love to shoot each other with their different animals. We have four different ones!!
Awesome  Very good price for size and quality. Would highly recommend it to anyone who loves domo :) great gift for anyone
Cute!  too cute for words!
Adorable  I bought this for my sloth-loving daughter.  After reading the reviews about it shedding, I regretted purchasing this.  I picked at the fur once I took him out of the package and didn't notice any shedding.  The only thing that would make this better is velcro on his feet.
Super Soft  This Pooh is great! He's a great size and very very soft! The kids love to snuggle with him. Just how a Pooh should be!
This is really good stuff. The material is very good and it is original product
ok
Very cute and just as pictured.
Okay toy for 3 month old...better for maybe a 6 months old  We purchased this toy a week ago after purchasing the sister product "Horton" and "The Cat In the Hat"  Our son adores both of these toys immediately!  He can now easily grab them and bring it to his mouth.  However, the caterpillar is nice, but lacks the features that I love about the other MiYam toys. The way the legs are designed are absolutely perfect for tiny hands to get a hold of, and the perfect height to grab when hanging from a carseat, stroller or swing handle. But the caterpillar legs are too short and the body too fat for my baby to get a hold of. I love the fact that it's soft muted colors. I don't like my baby getting over stimulated (and cranky as a result) so, so far, we've only given him soft muted colors, and he does very well with them!  This toy also has a louder bell type rattle inside.  It's actually a very pleasant sound, not annoying at all like some of the other toys we've refused to buy for that reason!  I would recommend this for a baby that has a little bigger hands, so maybe a six month old. I would recommend the miYim organic bug toy or the musical owl stroller toy for a baby under 3 months over this caterpiller.
Perfect!  This was a gift for my daughter & she loves it!
Well made Disney plush. They always have a higher standard when comes to there official made toys.
These Work Well.  Was a little skeptical about the food staying fresh longer...but it really does.  Sliced onions, tomatoes, blueberries, cheese...etc, does stay fresher significantly longer that with our Rubbermaid containers.  Not recommended for tomato based products like spaghetti sauce or chili as they may stain, so we use the Rubbermaid containers for those items.  Highly recommend.
... is cute for my little girl it is really cool for your son or little  This is cute for my little girl it is really cool for your son or little girls really good to sleep with
Perfect!  An excellent choice for any young child.  Quality made too!!!
Adorable  My 2yo son loves it
Scared  I am scared I just ordered this yesterday on my aunts phone...... I hope it is as it says I'll get back to you when I get it!
LOVE IT! So SOFT!  Just love Clover - my daughter adores this plush she got him for her 6th birthday couldn't be happier with him!
Great Plushie!  My son loves this! Its very soft and durable which is perfect for a little guy who plays and cuddles hard :)
excellent product arrived on time and what I expected
It looks exactly like the picture!
Purchased because of GUND's good reputation and was not dissappointed.  Very cute and soft bunny.  I bought it for my great granddaughter for Easter.  Seems to be of good quality.
It arrived on time and i absolutely love it!!!!
My son loves his new stuffie and snuggles it every night!
My grandchildren love them, we watch Rudolph and they love to see how they act in the movie thanks Nayjoy
Very soft and loved the color !
LOVE IT
Love him!  I bought this for my granddaughter as she loves Tangled things, and Pascal is adorable anyway. This particular little guy is the BEST. Perfect size for her (2-1/2 years), very true-looking to the character in the movie. Perfect! And the price was good, also.
So Adorable!!
Super cute and fluffy my daughter is going to love this
thanks
Great surprise present.
super cute  My son likes playing with Otis the tractor as I read along to the book. a great little stuffed tractor!
very cute my kids are going to love them!!!
Love this pillow  Love this pillow! It is weighted in the bottom so it will stand on most flat surfaces. My daughters LOVE tossing it around.
Absolutely love them.
looks exactly as pictured
Perfect
this one has a nice quality. i love the texture of it and the quality. what an awesome find indeed.  this one has a nice quality. i love the texture of it and the quality. what an awesome find indeed.
Great gift  This is a real hit with the teenage crowd who loves playing the Zelda games. Thanks for the great gift.
Very soft, and just the right size for cuddling.
It works as expected.
great  Huge and great condition
Great!
Twas beautiful. The ladies loved it.
Super cute  Grand baby loved her Elmo!
So Soft and Amazing Quality  I got this for my boyfriend because he grew up with Patamon, and I am so happy and impressed with the quality!  I thought there would be a chance that seams would be messed up or colors off, but everything is done perfectly and nothing was out of place.  He was so soft and cuddly, I almost kept him for myself!  I love that you can bend the wings too!
granddaughter loved it!  just what I wanted...granddaughter loved it !
My niece loves it  bought as a gift and my two year old niece loved it.  I thought it was so cute I wanted to keep it.  Lol.
Exactly What I Wanted  I was so excited when I got my cube, it was exactly as described and exactly what I wanted. This plushie is soft, cute, and unlike the other ones I've looked at, it actually looks like and holds the shape of a cube really well for a stuffed toy. I love it and highly recommend it!
My daughter likes him and...  I like him too. He's soft and matches the Minnie we got from Disney good. The colors of their shows are slightly different. I know the differences between the two, but she doesn't and does not care. Minnie has fingers, but this Mickey has mittens. He does not have a stamp on his foot as shown in the picture. I have compared him to others and I feel he's the best out of others I've seen with funny shaped heads.
gummy bear is awesome grand baby loves it
Perfect in every way
Awesome nailer  I've owned this nailer for about 5 years.  I've used it to put up over 2 miles of custom made trim work in my house, plus countless other projects.  The Pros:  - excellent Senco quality - 1000's of nails and only... uh, did I ever get a jam?  I can't really remember.  Maybe I got one once.  If I did, it was easy to clear and apparently not overly memorable. - ease of loading - nice non-marring tip - angled nail rack allows you to get into tight corners - light enough to use all day. - relatively quiet.  The Cons:  - uh... can't really think of any.  It would have been nice if it would have come with a free case of beer!  That's about all I got.  If mine ever died or was stolen, I'd buy another in a heartbeat!
Nice plush, love oddish
Cute plush hippo  This is an adorable plush toy for age six months and up. My grandson is two and is beginning to bond with his stuffed animals, so we thought this might be a fun toy for him to play with.  It is!  He likes the giggle and laughs along with it.  At first, his laughs were real and now he is fake laughing along with the stuffed toy.  I like that he has learned a little cause and effect with this toy and is role playing along with it.  It is soft and, very importantly, it has an off switch.
got it for some one
Love it~  I guess! My Pokemon daughter loves the plush dolls and sleeps with them every night. She never can wait to collect more.
Was hard to find elsewhere  Cute and what I was looking for. Arrived early too. Son was so happy! Definitely for Star Wars angry bird fans!
amazing toy  My daghter loves this toy .it looks just like the picture.
This toy is well made- the tail has a place where it's not stuffed, so the tail has a lifelike motion. Got it for my grandson. It arrived early and very well packaged.
TY
Super cute!  Super cute - will go perfectly with my daughter's 21" Rapunzel doll! And I paid less than $8 - can't beat that!
High quality work on this piece. It arrived sooner than expected.
Adorable!
This is a gift for Christmas  Our 9 year old granddaughter loves these.  We actually purchased two of them (different colors).  The item was delivered in a prompt fashion and it looks just as advertised.  Thank you
Thank you!
I love this so much  asuna is perfect I love Sao and this plush is great it looks like her and the art of the fabric is great
Got it for my GF, she loves it
So cute!  This is so cute! My only complaint is that it came one day later than expected when I selected the 2 day shipping option. But it's not a big deal beacause my daughter loves it!
These giraffes are to die for!  I bought these as a favor for my daughter's upcoming birthday party. They are adorable and very well made! They shipped when they said they would and arrived in good condition. I am so excited to give these out at her party and feel good knowing it won't be a favor that is immediately throw out once the kids go home.
Still loved by my kids though  Really cute. This is bigger than I thought. It's a stuffed plush animal. Doesn't stand on its own. Still loved by my kids though!
I loved it!
So cute and soft.
Sunflower Plush  My Grandaughter loves the sunflower only rhe battery did not last long only a couple of days, It goes everywhere with her
Great deal!!!  This is the best thing that's happened to my little guy.  Very pleased with this purchase!!!
Awesome  Baby loves it.  He won't go anywhere without it.  PLUS it washes very well.  We have washed him over 5 times with no apparent wear.
you will love  Buy it, you will love it
This was a huge hit with my 2 year old son. He was always trying to sleep with his hard trucks, and now he has something soft that still goes "vroom".  It can handle all the rougher play and still hold it's shape.
Cute  Very cute and well made.  My granddaughter loved it.
I cant wait to give it to  my boyfriend  It arrived in great condition, I'm giving it as a Christmas gift to my boyfriend, he loves stitch
love it
Big, Soft, and fun to toss around!  Price wise I was a bit skeptical at first due to most of the other stuffed versions of the Minecraft creatures being rather small and such. But when the delivery was made and I opened my package I was not expecting him to be so big! He is very soft, fits in my lap perfectly, and younger members of the household adore him. Also very hard not to snuggle with! Definitely worth the buy and I hope the Ender dragon plush is the same way!
Awesome Christmas Present!  I got this for Christmas this year! It looks exactly like it does in the picture. I got this in a plastic bag thingy, but I don't know what it was packaged in or how long it took to come. It looks really awesome and I totally recommend this to any sailor moon fan or as a gift.
My grand baby loved this!
My baby is in love!  I'm so happy I ordered this little trio for my 2 1/2 yr old daughter who is a huge Gaba fan. I kinda hesitated because its not a complete set, but I figured what heck! I didn't tell my daughter I even ordered them for her. But when I handed her the bag they came in, (which they came in really fast!) her eyes almost fell out of her head when she saw them! She screamed with excitement! The sizes of these little characters are perfect, now she can carry them everywhere she goes, oppose to carrying her pillow size Brobee! The only downfall is, its not a complete set and even though I didn't think she would notice, boy was I wrong. The first thing she said is "mommie where is Toodee, Plex and DJ Lance Rock?" So guess what I'm on the hunt for now! But overall I'm very pleased!
Cute!  Cute. Exactly as pictured. My nephew loves it.
good..as expected  Early  delivery  than expected
i like big daleks and i can not lie, ze doctor can't deny cause i exterminated him yesterday :)
I got this as a christmas gift acouple of months ago from this post, it was from my sister who got it off my list! Its so cute and my absolute one of my top 5 pokemon :)
Nice size!
Looks like  My daughter loves frozen. These are so cute and they talk. Looks like Anna
Quality Cat in the Hat  This stuffed cat may be small but he is well made and should last a while even with kids of all ages hugging his stuffing!  After much handling by three grandchildren, none of his "fur" is shedding, so it doesn't get all over your clothing!  He is a good price for all the quality sewn into him.
Excellent
So cute.
Great!  Originally bought this item in 2014. It is still in perfect condition and my daughter still sleeps with it every night.
Thank you
works great  works great
Love these, they are beautiful, sturdy and work!
It was a hit
Isabelle is the coolest!  Ok when I first discovered Isabelle I got a flash back of a chic I went to high school with. She was not nearly as cool as the Isabelle in Animal Crossing New leaf...lol...With that being said just buy this epic plush Alriiiiiiite!
my grandson loves his Yoshi - it is just what he wanted  However, there was a place on the bottom of the toy that was not stiched properly and we had to repair it here.
good quality and nice size  Very cute, good quality and nice size.  Not as soft as spunky hedgehog but no complaints
Very cute blanket.  I ordered this blanket for a friend's new baby girl. She loved it since she's nuts over Minnie Mouse. The blanket is very small. Could be used for a baby doll as well.
MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT
My son's been begging for a pug I didn't want another dog this was the perfect combination! Very soft and sturdy good quality long lasting toy.
I loved, very cute  I loved ,very cute
Great quality and great products  They came as advertised!  Great quality and great products.  If you are looking for the whole set, you cannot beat the price nor the quality!
My little girl lover her CatBus! She is hard to please!
Adorable,  soft,  we love it
Perfect  It was exactly what my wife wanted. Perfect gift
Cute online AND in person!  He's so stinkin' cute!
Clean and packaged nicely. Received in a timely manner  Really cute! Clean and packaged nicely. Received in a timely manner. Thank you! My son will love this character (the walnut)!
So soft and cute!  I got these for my minecraft-loving daughter! she said she wanted and enderman for Christmas, so I got this set. They are VERY soft and plushy and she LOVED them!
Cutest Plushie!  I love this plushie, it's very big and soft. Definitely adorable and his face looks a little nice in person. While not the best representation of Flynn Rider's face, the plush is well-made with soft fabrics that would make any child ADORE it.
soft and loveable  my granddaughters LOVE them.walk around with them the whole time they visit and always take their naps with them.they are soft and very well made
A definite hit  My daughters both have one of these dogs, and they love them.  They take him everywhere, and their friends always want to play with him.  Definitely a hit with the preschool and pre-teen girls!
Smaller than it looks  Dolls look really nice but I thought they were a little bigger.  They will make very nice gifts for girls that have seen the movie.
these are sooo great..  these are sooo great...i love to annoy my guinea pig with them. he just looks at me like wtf, then turns his back and meanders away...lmao
She loved it. Great Buy  I bought this for my young niece. She loved  it. Great Buy!
Huge and awesome!  This guy is huge and awesome! This was my girlfriend's main Christmas present, she had seen it at Walmart a while back and then they suddenly vanished. He is very soft and fluffy. His eyes and mouth are also a soft material so if you get this for a kid or something they won't hurt themselves. Also it makes it more comfortable to cuddle with if there is no plastic on it, that's what my girlfriend is using it for right now, body pillow lol
I love it!
unique Hello Kitty.  I bought this as a Christmas gift and I know that the little girl is going to love it. She and her family go to Hawaii frequently and she loves Hello Kitty.
Daughter loves it
Excellent price for such a cute little elephant!.  Used him as a diaper cake centerpiece.  Too cute!
My boys are obsessed with this thing!
Excellent all around!  I got this for my daughter who was posing as Steve Irwin for a school project (even though it is an alligator, not a croc!). Received it the next day and all 3 of my kids love it. They now share it between them and take "Crikey" everywhere. Excellent quality and super fast arrival, coupled with super happy kids and I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase!
Talking Poppy is adorable.  Beautiful Poppy. Love her smile. Talks fun lines.
Grandson loves them  Cute plushies
Great, soft and a good size
granddaughter loved it!  I bought this for my granddaughter who is hooked on elmo. she carries this around all the time,and has to sleep with it. I got a great price too.
If you have Sophia, you need minimus.  cute and huggable.
Must have for Elmo fans!  Very sweet toy, Elmo not only gives hugs but also talks, sings, and goes to sleep. My one year old son got him for Christmas this past year and was so adorable carrying around such a big Elmo.
it's the same as all the other products I have got my son he likes it
Buckle Toy "Buster"  Sent this to my 15 month old granddaugther, who has become obsessed with buckling the belt on her booster seat.  She doesn't live near me, but my daughter says she likes it, and just has to get the idea of matching the colors to buckle.
great buy  Really love this little guy seems to be put together well got it for grandsons birthday and he loves it he is a bit smaller that I had originally thought but otherwise awesome
Awesome.... It's a lot bigger than I thought it would be.
Happy  Happy
Great  My grandson loved it.  He's an Angry Bird fanatic!  Great to be able to find it on Amazon instead of having to trek around stores to find it.
Well made  Very well made plush. My only complaint is that that Treecko doesn't have the suction cup hanger like Mudkip and Torchic does.
"It's not easy being green."  I love this Kermit doll.  I pose it a work and take selfies and pictures of it in different poses.  When we hit our goals at work, the numbers are highlighted in green.  I can tell you that, "It's not easy being green."  I capitalize on this fact and run around with Kermit thanking people for their work.  The material it is made of is very good and  I don't see it peeling from use any time soon if ever.
It's a keeper  My daughter LOVES this doll.  Marie is one of her favorite Disney characters and this stuffed animal has made her very happy.
My friend is in love  I gave this to my Mario addicted 15 year old friend and when he saw he jumped up and ran in for the hug. it was actually hilarious! no complaints and it actually does stand if you get it right. two day shipping with amazon prime-its a good deal if you buy a lot. The Goomba is great for the price. Definitely recommend.
Excellent Product
A Huge Hit With My Dog  Our Norwich Terrier Norman, who usually ignores doggie toys, goes NUTS when we shoot a screaming monkey across the room.  He grabs it, flings it around (setting off more screaming) and never gets bored with it. Sooner or later, he bites through the sound mechanism, silencing the screams... and making it a lot less fun. So we buy them a half dozen at a time.  THIS IS A FUN TOY FOR HUMANS AND DOGS!
They are adorable.  Expressive, soft yet full.
I am sure that my granddaughter is going to LOVE it!  Came quickly and undamaged.  I am sure that my granddaughter is going to LOVE it!!!
gets great reactions!!
Grandchildren love them  Grandchildren love them
Very cute toy.
adorable, and quite a bit larger than it looks on the webpage - but that's a good thing!
My daughter loves it.
Daughter loved it.
My daughter loves this!
Nice to form a collection for fans of this saga, my wife loves ...
So adorable  My daughter is a month shy of turning three and is in love with the Sago Mini characters. When I saw that they had turned the adorable characters into toys, I knew we had to get one for her. Jinja is her favorite, so when she opened the box she was over the moon excited. The toy is just shy of 9 inches tall and is made of a soft, microfiber material. Jinja is very sturdy, but still very soft and huggable. My daughter absolutely adores her and carries her everywhere. So far it has held up incredibly well. The only complaint I have is the price. I happened to buy the toy when it was on sale for Black Friday and found that price a lot more reasonable for this type of toy. As much as she loves them, I wouldn't have purchased it at full price.
Princess Leia, really cute plushy  My daughter loves Angry Birds Star Wars. When she saw this plush she had to have it. Super cute, durable, well-stitched. Great buy!
Cute af  Really cute. My girlfriend loves it.
cute  cute baby loves
Plush bee  This a big bee from the Bee Movie he is big plush toy so cute especially his face he has black hands antennas and feet thanks great price and delivery
AWESOME!  It's bigger than I thought it would be and really cuddly and squishy. It's well made and unlike the picture used on the product description, the colors are movie accurate. I adored the movie and this is a great piece of merchandise.
Belle Turtle is wonderful!  Gave it to 20-months old granddaughter to play with during a 12-hour car ride, and she and her parents loved it!  I love it's bright colors, softness and it's size.  Just bought 2 more Buckle Toys - they are great!
ADORABLE BEYOND WORDS!!!!!  I am IN LOVE with this little fella.  So soft and huggable.  He arrived the next day and when I rescued him from the protective  wrapping...instantly fell head over heals.  I adore what the company built itself upon and am a huge fan for what they stand for.  You cannot go wrong.  AWESOME!!!!!
Very please with the order
excellent toy  this is a fun and lovely toy, it is durable, arrived on time it is educational i recomended it to give at gift
excelente
It's Pooh!  What else do you need to say?  It's such a soft plush Pooh bear!  My grandson adores him.
and is being enjoyed. I would buy again  Arrived on time, and is being enjoyed. I would buy again .
Perfect
little cutie
Super cute!  Bought this and the Sailor Moon plush as a present for my niece and she loves them both. There's a tag that says not for children under 15 due to choking hazard but I can't imagine why since it doesn't really have any small parts and typically that sort of warning is for toddlers, so that's a bit confusing. Maybe they're intended to be more collectables than toys, but my niece has a great time playing with these dolls (she's seven) and pretending to fight monsters. They came exactly as pictured and they're both really adorable. I'd say they make both a great toy and collector's item.
Adorable and nice size and quality.
my grand daughter loves pato and the crew
Anger!  Love this toy!  I wish there was a slightly smaller version that I could put on my rear tow hook
:-)  This little badger stuffed animal is very cute and just what I expected! The package was sturdy and arrived fast. Very happy with my purchase.
He loved it. It's really small  Got this as a present for my boyfriend. He loved it. It's really small, but adorable.
great seller, nice product
Big and cute  Super big and cuddly. It's nice to see a great quality plush that's also large!
Item was as described and the receiver loved it.
m happy with it  Small,but I;m happy with it.
Llama Llama Cuddly!!  My son loves when we read any/all of the Llama Llama books, so when I saw this, I knew he'd be thrilled.  And thrilled he was!  It's adorable!
Exactly as it looks in pic  I bought this for my mom when she was dying to give her comfort.  It looks exactly like her late Bichon.  She really liked it!  Mom is gone now, so I donated the toy.  I hope someone else gets comfort from it.
Happy with purchase  Arrived timely and as described.
AB Plush Leia  My nephew just loves her.  I think they have about every angry bird plush toy there is from all of the angry bird games.
My four year old grandson loved it. I loved it because the sounds are not too loud. And the lights are not overly bright to keep him awake at night.
Very Satisfied With Kyogre Like I Was With The Groudon Plush of this Type!!  Awesome Arrived Way Before The Expected Dated. Well I can Say this I love Hoenn ORAS is currently my favorite games along with Pokemon GSC. Well Anyway Primal Kyogre May Not be my favorite of the three weather trio but he is most definitely not my least favorite. Rayquaza is my least favorite one no offense to the emerald fans but the duo groudon and kyogre was better. Kyogres quality is simular than groudons and yes it does have imperfections like the circle on his head isn't symmetrical but hey what do you expect its a plushie. Its not as big as groudon and i believe out of all 3 kyogre is the smallest doesn't mean it gets treated any less. I refuse to get mega rayquaza mainly because of the bad reviews and how dramatically the priced dropped on it. Its not like i cared i really never wanted a rayquaza plush anyway not a fan of it and never was. I have a simular feeling with Zygarde just a Stupid Idea to add a 3rd. Especially since both are dragon types. There are just too many dragon legends that i lost interest in all dragon type especially since fairy can super effect it lame!! However back to Kyogre its quality isn't as nice as groudon and i most definitely would not have bought Kyogre for $40 as I did for Groudon. But my Kyogre was only $24 and well worth it I wouldn't even give $10 for the raquaza plush. Who'd wanna cuddle a pole lol. Groudon and kyogre definitely has the cuddly shape love them Both and thank you AMAZON!!
Love them in winter
Darling!  Darling!
happy mommy  Nice cat in the hat I love it however, my baby girl 1 year old loves the cat in the hat show but she really didn't take to this plush doll. I gave 5 stars because she's a baby and babies like what they like when they like it. You know how that goes...
My son had to have this to go with raven.
they're adorable  This is one of three Pokmon Center Original Plush Dolls that I ordered as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter (it was on her Amazon Wish List.) She stated It was well-packaged and it's perfect. She also wrote (regarding all three) Thanks so much, they're adorable.
the plushie was great it looked really well made (: my gf loved it
Very cute.  Thank you.
Very pleased with this purchase!  It's very hard to find wailmer merchandise (including plush's, hats, watering cans) and I was surprised to have found this one.  It took less than a week to reach me, which is good because it is going to be made into a present.  It's a decent size, though a little smaller than I had originally wished but it is very soft, arrived in perfect condition, and is as cute as the photo.
he loved it!  This was a gift; he loved it!
Nice quality and very soft.
SOO ADORABLE!!!!!!  Dratini is one of my favorite Pokemon, so it's quite expected that I don't have much to complain about! This plush is truly the most adorable one I've obtained so far, considering most Pokemon toys are made cheaply. I will say that it is a bit small; some might expect the Dratini to be life-sized for its price. But none of that bothered me! The doll is cute and nicely crafted, plus it IS rare, so I don't mind the size at all! I recommend it to anyone who adores Dratini.  Oh, and here is a photo showing Dratini's size proportion as opposed to my FACE!
ALL OK
great for the kids
Great toy for quiet times. It has helped us get through many church services and airplane rides.
Kawaii  Very soft and nice love the size great for a desk ornament!!!
My 12 year old great-grandson loves it!
Love it and so did 3 year old Ava..
Awesome Olaf. He is bigger than I expected and the kids love him!
I love him!!  The Deidara plush is so adorable, I looked at many other Deidara plush dolls but I could not resist this one!! His hair is soft his fingers for the jutsu are well done his cloak is beautiful, his ring is exact like the one in the anime. He has 5 fingers and 5 toes on each foot, he only has 4 fingers with the hand sign but that's understandable. He's just so cute!!! But don't complain because this is a chibi so most his height is his head and hair.
Happy surprise  Bigger than I thought, granddaughter very happy.
Our 9yr old was ecstatic  Small, but good for the price
Great engine right out of the box!  I purchased this engine to replace the worn out 8 hp engine I had on my pull behind tiller. After pricing a direct replacement for the original engine at the tune of over $650, I found this gem to takes it place. For me it was not a direct replacement, but I didn't think it would be when I ordered it either. With a little metal work I was tilling my garden in no time. Just added oil and gas; second pull out of the box it fired right up with no adjustments needed. Has plenty of power to replace the 8hp engine that was on the tiller originally.
My daughter loves her!  My daughter loves Peppa pig!
Baby gift  This is a sweet little bunny. I bought it for a baby gift, and the new mom loved it! I've bought these before as new baby presents, and I was never disappointed.
This little guy is so cute! My son loves it!
love it  my daughter loved this hello kitty beanie baby alot. she has slep with it everynight since we got it. it was a fast shipping thats y i rate it as a 5 star. thanks so much
Just the right size and softness
I love him
Sailor Moon all the Way  Our 9 year old daughter is a huge sailor moon fan after she found my old collection of dvds. THis was well made, slightly larger than hand size which we were aware of.
excellente i'm very happy
The copycat ninja  Its Kakashi raise his hiatai and you can see the sharigan. Pretty cool little plushie.
Extremely realistic and lifelike in appearance  We love this dog! We bought it for our eight-year-old daughter after our little bichon frise passed away. This doggie looks extremely realistic and lifelike. It almost appears to come to life when we pet it. The entire family has enjoyed him. :)
His favorite Paw Patrol  Child loves it . His favorite Paw Patrol .
Best little soft Dora  I have been looking all over the place for a soft little Dora doll for my 13 month old who, much to my dismay, loves DORA.  I found this, it just arrived.  It is PERFECT for her tiny hands.  It is small but still has everything that we have come to expect and love about Dora.  Her hair is made of loose strands of yarn which is much more charming than her true helmet-head on TV.  Backpack does not have a face on her and does not come off, which I really like.  I don't love giving TV characters to my kids  so this one that is toned-down is perfect for me.  It has a sweet face, no music, no lights, no hard plastic body parts, no loud laughing when you tickle it's tummy, and best of all, no yelling (which is all Dora does, right??)  Perfect little lovable doll to satiate a young child who loves Dora.
Great for the Angry Birds Star Wars fan  Got it as a gift for my nephew (he's 4) and he squealed with delight when he opened the gift. He played with them all day on Christmas.
amazing quality great price!  I was surprised by the quality and price of this product! It arrived quickly, about 2 weeks before expected arrival date and it's a quality product. MY son is a huge minecraft fan and will love this gift! it's very soft and has the mojang tag on it, I was concerned that I would be getting a knock off because of the lower price but it isn't. I'm very happy with my purchase.
Great value  Everything came as pictured.  The Elf's hat had to be re-glued after a couple of days but otherwise excellent.
Good  Fox is chubbier than picture looks lol but extremely soft & very cute! It's shorter than a fire extinguisher but not by much if that helps with sizing. Not as orange as in picture but very close and matches the rest of the set great! Not disappointed :)
The Steven Universe Toy was amazing gift for my little brother, it has the gem in the belly!
I know the little boy would love it because it was so soft  It was a gift for an child at xmas time. I know the little boy would love it because it was so soft. The child was off a xmas tree at the Elks club.
My daughter loved it! Really super soft!
Very soft and well put together item, my daughter loves this doll!
Item was as described. My kid loves it.
Great for 3-6 year olds! Any Pokemon lover actually...  Quality toy / collectible which has been sold for prices as high as $100. This seller definitely has the best price!
Super cute! Soft material. Good size. Buy it! 
Rouge the Bat is so cute!  I made my granddaughter a Rouge the Bat costume for Halloween. She'll be very happy to get this stuffed animal to play dress up with. Nice quality and size at a very reasonable price!
Kirito Plush  I'm a huge SAO fan and I love all of the little anime plushes. This is exactly what I expected it to be. Very happy with my purchase!
she loved it.  Bought as Christmas presents for my granddaughter, she loved it.
who doesn't love beatrix potter??  as a child i did & i bought this for my granddaughter.
Amazon does it again!  my grand son loved it!
LOVE! I am a huge fan of Boo on Facebook, and I thought that this little replica dog would be a great addition to my stuffed animal collection. I was completely right! He is super soft and very well made. I have dragged him around to different places, and he has yet to tear. He is stiff enough without being hard, and his little face is adorable! A very well made toy for not that bad of a price.
So cute. Nice Mickey  Very nice product. Big plush. Brand new and authentic
Perfect for my grand-daughter.
Love owls and this one is amazing  Love owls and this one is amazing. So soft and beautiful. I'm in love with this soft plush. Her name is Panchita. Lol. Thank you so much.
Omg love it! Great size  Omg love it! Great size. VERY soft! Purchased as a gift, but I want to buy one to keep for myself.
Kids love it
My daughter loves this doll! We got the matching Elsa doll along with Anna
Kids loved the elf girl.
My son Joshua says it's awesome!!
Niece love it! Great packageing for kids with asthma!  Come in a plastic sealed bag, which was great for my niece who has asthma. When she unwrapped the gift and took it out of his bag he was nice, soft and felt good to the touch. She instantly hugged him and gave him kisses. He is about 12inches tall and the perfect size for a 2 to 3 year old toddler.
LOVED IT!!!  I took this toy with me on the airplane so my baby would be distracted, and it was the best thing that I could have done!! She was so entertained that the 8 hour flight went by in a flash! loved it!!
My boys are really into fishing and they especially love catfish so this was a GREAT find!!
i love it  The product is as I purchased and was in great shape.  It was shipped out quickly and received promptly and just exactly as it was advertised.  highly recommend if a star wars fan.
Well made, stands on its own.  It's purple.  From photo I couldn't tell and thought it was black.
Angry Birds Plush  Bought this along with the Angry Birds Storm Trooper for my nephew at Christmas. A great gift for any child.
belt  It was a little smaller than I thought but Im still very happy with this product.
sorry this is discontinued  I love this moisturizer and am very sorry that it is discontinued. Nothing comes close. Neutrogena should produce and distribute this moisturizer again.
I like it very much  It's so cute, I like it very much. I bought it as a gift for my pet, also a pomeranian dog, I am sure she will like this lovely gift very much.
Ole Elmo arrived quickly, and he was just as he was advertised.  Thank you!
love him so soft and cute :)
Great gift for an injured child.  We bought this for a child who had recently broke her arm. She loved it. It was a very generous size and good quality.
Cute Hello Kitty Plush  I bought this for my wife and she loved it, she is a big hello kitty fan so I thought it would make her smile when she got this and she did smile, it a great brand and any women of hello kitty lover needs to have this in there collection.
Very nice!  This is well-made.  My daughter is very happy with this!
Raikou Doll Review  I bought this exact Raikou doll at Anime Expo 2012 for $35 (if memory serves) so being $31 on amazon I believe it is well worth the price. Raikou is my favorite pokemon so of course I would say that, but the material the doll is made of is very soft and doesn't dirty easily (its been half way around the world and back!), it also stands on its own just fine. Bottom line is if you are totally in love with this doll, you should get it!
Used this for a Peppa pig family costume for halloween and worked perfectly because the pig is big enough to look like a baby  Cute and quite large. Used this for a Peppa pig family costume for halloween and worked perfectly because the pig is big enough to look like a baby.
Love that you get Sebastian and Ciel together  Love that you get Sebastian and Ciel together! They're so cute and I love that Ciel has the contract under the patch!
Well made and fun to play with  This is for my son who LOVES all things minecraft. He's got a room full of these guys and the Ender Dragon is definitely a favorite. It's often seen flying piggy around the house! He also helps cook by lighting the stove with his fire for me. Yeah, my son really loves this guy and I see him a lot lol!  He's probably 24 inches nose time to tail, so he's long rather than big and bulky though I guess for a plush toy he's pretty big. He looks very good, it's hard to get a plush to keep squared lines and they did a good job of keeping this guy squeezable but blocky.
Cute little elephant  This little elephant is so cute and very well made!  I do agree with others about the price though. I had purchased one around eight dollars And then when I went to purchase again they were double in price.
Adorable!  As an animal rescuer, I love the assortment of dogs and cats so I can teach my preschoolers to love all animals.
Great price! Very soft lovey for my son.
Well made.  This is a cute (although pricey) part of the Little Mozarts collection!
Baby's first ray.  Ordered it for a buddies baby during a chuggies for huggies party.  (He's a freshwater stingray keeper as am I)  He and his wife loved it, now baby get's its first ray too!
so cute!
Adorable!  My toddler loves this Poppy doll!  It's about her size and adorable.  Totally worth it.
good product
Pretty cool Pokmon plush for a good price.
SOOO CUTE MY SON LOVES IT  This is perfect to buy with the Elmo bed time story book. I bought both and highly recommend from ages 4 months on up to three years old. The songs are cute, i love the PJ's of fish and little Elmo is so adorable. My son couldn't put it down when we took it out of the box. Fast shipping!
good and durable
This Pikachu is really soft and beautiful, looks exactly like the picture
Excellent quality, bigger than I thought and received it very fast.
son loved it!  got it as a middle school end of school year gift... son loved it!
00 shipping couldn't go wrong works great.  It was only $30.00 plus $5.00 shipping couldn't go wrong works great.
... daughter's 3rd as a birthday gift and she was super happy when she opened it up  I got this for my daughter's 3rd as a birthday gift and she was super happy when she opened it up.
Great toy for a busy toddler!
Well made, kids love  Gave for a 9 years olds present.  She loved it, well made and cute.
Quality as expected  Just like on a picture, not fake one, Hight quality. Wish was bigger, but my daughter is thrilled. Thank you for sending just in time before her birhtday.
Perfect cuddly size
Very adorable. Bought as a gift for a friend
Easy to use!  This is great when you need to angle the ratchet set to however suits your needs without having to use the small right angle power drill/driver.
Awesome!  Thank you so much for this!  It is perfect for my son! he loves mike the best!  he is going to love this!
Nice quality and size  My granddaughter (2 years old) loves Sofia the First and loves this cuddly Clover! She has been sleeping with it every night since she got it! Nice quality and size!
perfect  Amazing and worth the money. It's a good size and supeeeer soft. I love the colors on it as well, very pastel soft colors. It reminds me of plushies for babies. XD
Excellent!  This is really well made, very soft and cuddly, stands up on its own, and is adorable. I gave it as a gift and the recipient was very happy.
not like cheap imitations  This plush is very quality, not like cheap imitations. My son loved it!
Good quality.  Olfa is so cute and cuddly.  Good quality.
This is a really cute plush!  It looks great.  The colors are bright and it is soft to the touch.  My son LOVES it!
4 year old ..loved it  Gave this to a 4 year old for his birthday. He seemed to love it with his big smile and hugs. His mother said he slept with it that night. Seemed to me it was made nicely , colors were bright, pillow was full.
Wife and daughter wanted a Maltese (which I dislike) so they got this.  Totally fooled them when I first presented it, very realistic.
We used this larger tiger to tie the colored balloons to it. They were given to the expectant parents and grandparents to be as souvenirs.
My one year old LOVES Larry (VocabuLarry).
Wonderful size!  Not too big, not too small. It is a beloved part of my daughter's world and has help up well. Best price I found on a tigger, too.
great toy!  great quality, and fantastic customer service
I like it  It is still on my golf club.  I like it
Granddaughter will be very happy with this!
Absolutely adorable! The matching set is super cute  Absolutely adorable! The matching set is super cute. I hang them from my rear view mirror and have a hard time choosing between the two.
Fun hat. Battery was a little hard to find  Fun hat.  Battery was a little hard to find.
... than I expected bought as a gift the person loved it.  So cute bigger than I expected bought as a gift the person loved it.
This was a great addition to my sons pirate themed birthday  This was a great addition to my sons pirate themed birthday. Fit him great (he has a large head for a kid). fits like a s/m fitted ball cap. Music is clear and eyes flashing were pretty neat for the kids.
He is the best Plush toy ever. So soft and very well made
Cute and cuddly.  Mario is always a hit in any costume
I sent this barking dog to my granddaughter in Greenland for her first birthday.  She loves dogs. I wasn't there to see her open it but her Mom said she loves it.
Great Plush! Fast Shipping!  Great product and shipped fast! Only took five days to arrive. She has a lovely appearance and there is no glue showing like there usually is with most dolls I find! Would definitely recommended to other Sailor Moon/ Sailor Jupiter lovers. c:
He's to cute!  Oh my gosh, just to cute!
Shipped fast and my son loved it.  We got it when it said it was to be delivered, and it's precisely what my son (and I) expected.  It's definitely (in my opinion) one of the cuter pokemon.
My grandson thought it was awesome!
An excellent choice!  Our grandson (age 21 months) LOVES Elmo, and this one is perfect in every way!  I love the fact that Elmo is made so that he can sit up alone, and that he is soft, cuddly,  just right for snuggling with.  I am SO glad that I didn't choose a smaller version of Elmo...
It came super fast and packaged nicely! I love it! So adorable!!
Excellent!!! So beautifull, it looks exactly like the picture.
Exactly like the picture  Exactly like the picture, we bought this for my 2 yr old, who recently got into finding nemo! She loves it! Shipping was really fast too!
Great
Toy Story's Woody  Since my son Robert went off to college in 2010 he had an affinity for Woody, since Andy went off to college in the same year.  Bought it for him for Christmas to take back to college and place it on his bed, such a fun item.
Too flippin' cute!
Surprisingly good quality  Originally I ordered this plush as a companion for a chibi Link plush so that the two could be displayed together; I didn't expect to love it as much as I do. The quality is top-notch - the fabric is soft to the touch and perfect for cuddling, and the detailing & stitching are all very nice. I was surprised at how well-made and adorable this plush was; extremely pleased with my purchase.
Stuffed  They're plush Mario and plush Luigi.
Great item  I ordered all 7 Bubble Puppies for my 18 month old granddaughter at Christmas.  She loves them.  She sleeps with all of them every night.  The items look just like they do on TV.  I recommend these for any child who watches Bubble Guppies.
Elmo is a winner again
Great For Any Age  A great toy for young & old. This chicken toy entertains my year old grandson, my girlfriends over tea & is a riot at all my parties.
Amazing!!!!  This particular plush is much larger than the official Nintendo/ Tomy product (By about 3 inches), and super cute. The fabric used is very soft, and it's a great present for younger and older kids. I personally like it because it's not too stiff or floppy, and it's a very huggable plush. My only issue is tiny: the tails aren't sewn together. But that can be fixed easily by stitching them together. Other that that, it's perfect! Also a nice size for the price I paid for it.
Great! it look really nice and fells like a dirty little sloth, my son love it.
I got this for our 18 month old grandaughter and she loves it. She watches the Frozen movie with her older sister and loves having something from the movie. Sturdy enough to last through allot of play from and 18 month old.
Perfect  Love it! Exactly what I was expecting! Arrived on time!
My grandson loved it
she loved it.  Bought this for my 6 year old granddaughter....she loved it...
Dedenne Pokmon Stuffed Animal  Cute & needed for any Pokemon collector! He was fatter & smaller than he expected but still love him. Product arrived on time. Was a Christmas present.

Perfect Hulk doll  So cute and my son really likes it even though he's only 10mos old haha!
6 year old grandson loved it!  My grandson was tickled by this Pokleman plush toy...
Hello Ponyo  She was a little smaller but all in all adorable.  Surprised me more because she's a keychain, so more portability
Easterific  Cute adorable! Purchased for my mother M&M fanatic absolutly loved this one for Easter. Ears are posable and bucket can be filled with a candy bar

A fun gift for someone who loved the original back in time!
Cute gift!  I bought this for my niece as a gift. It's really cute and soft.

Was even better when arrived.
Love it!  Absolutely fun and great for a teether! Stays in great condition after washing.
Exactly as shown in picture, will make a great addition to my Archie/Aogiri cosplay!  Arrived quicker then the expected delivery date. Super soft and cuddle-able. Wonderful quality, can defiantly tell the difference from this, and the knock off ones, that some other sellers here on Amazon are trying to sell. Has the Official Pokemon Center tags on it. Very happy and satisfied with it all :) Would order from this seller again!

Good  Ordered as a gift for a child. I got it fast and it was as described. A I Y A
arrived on time & as described, seems like good quality although he has not played with it yet since it
Short and squat.  It's a small toy, but perfect size for my 3-year-old! He didn't care much for it, which was disappointing because he loved it when he saw the picture!
Great for your Elmo lover!  We purchased this for our toddler for Christmas, and we have had so much with it.  IT was super easy to program on our newer computer w/XP.  I didn't have any problems at all and I am not a computer wizard.  It sounds just like elmo and sings as well!  Don't let others problems discourage you.  If it doesn't work have someone else try it or return for another one.  It works easily and is really fun personalized toy!  Our Elmo fan will love it!
Excellent product!  I bought this for my son's pirate-themed nursery and the product is great!  It is very soft and well-made.  I would definitely recommend to others!
Excellent!  Very nice!  The right size and reasonably priced.  Just keep them away from a tennis ball-loving dog as they will be crushed with one bite.  Shipped quickly, too.
UGLY BUT CUTE  Grandson wanted for his Birthday.  When order was placed not sure what it would look like.  It arrived in really good shape and on time.  It looked ugly, but, when package was opened and saw the vibrant colors.  It's PERFECT!  Would recommend this supplier to anyone.
This is great for fine motor skills  This is great for fine motor skills. Keeps my daughter busy. She really enjoys clicking all the buckles over and over. If your child is obsessed with buckles like mine is, this is the toy for them!
Well made
Unbelievably Kawaii  I love love love my dancing plush hello kitty doll speaker, she was so amazing I had wanted to buy her for weeks before I decided to take the plunge and splurge on purchasing her and she was shipped out so fast I was so excited to have her once I got her I even made a video of her and uploaded it to my youtube channel she was shipped out immediately it wasn't even a week before I received her in hand. I love strapya world best company EVER! In case anyone wants to check out the speaker in action here's the link(...)
Little buddy toy  Bought this for my nephew and he loved it
Perfect  This was perfect of a gift to my pregnant friend. She dd her nursery in lord of the rings.
she has a tail!  Great plush with a cute devil tail. Very fine detail! Ty has outdone themselves with this one. I wish all these hello kitty plushes had the same attention to detail!
Great Quality  My kid loves this little guy!
Great you for our 16 month old daughter  Great you for our 16 month old daughter. She is very curious and wants to know how everything works. This toy holds her attention longer than any other.
My daughter just loves Levi and I was very happy to find an excellent quality plush.
She loves it!
My son love it!!
Wonderful detail
PERFECT ESPURR PLUSH  It is an official Pokemon Center Espurr plush and is ABSOLUTELY NOT a bootleg. He's really soft, huggable, has great detail, and if just a great plush overall!! This is a must have for Espurr and Pokemon fans.
Perfect!  I bought this Dora and the Boots doll of the same size for my 2 year old daughter (who is in love with Dora) she carries them around in her backpack (the Dora backpack) and gives them kisses goodnight. They are the perfect size to travel along with us anywhere we go.. Very cute and affordable.
Mickey  bought this for my 6 month old grandson, he loves Mickey Mouse
Great for a lovey!  This is my 2 year old's favorite lovey. She carries Molly everywhere. It's a good size for small hands, and we have machine washed (and air dried) this several times with no problems.
My girlfriend loves her Charmander plushie
Soft  Nice gift for my granddaughter.
Wonderful  Bought this for my 18 month old for Christmas and it was definitely one of his favorite gifts. Mike makes noise whenever you pull on his arms or legs or poke him in the eye. It doesn't take any force at all, just a light tug and my son loves it.
Super cute baby gift!
MY GRANDSON LOVES lLAMA..  it is so worth it..delivery was quick
Another cool present for my boy(dog). Even the kids are envious.
Love it  Grand daughter will love this Disney Princess. Only problem is that Disney chose to place all their labels stitched into Ariels tail. I am sure they could have found a better place to put them. Otherwise another lovely princess for Grandma's collection.
Perfect  Perfect just as  describe
Nice Bunny Sophia's Friend!  Cute bunny for the child who loves Sophia The First.
Awesome Service and Product!!!  Awesome and on time for Christmas!!!
Adorable!  Hermie was just what I was looking for.  However, mine was not holding the spotted elephant,  he was carrying a book on Dentistry instead.  Very cute!
The best plush out there to buy!  I have seen all kinds of plushies out there for Toothless since the movie came out.  This one is by far the best one that you can buy!  It's got great coloring, and even with the wire in the wings for pose ability it's still very "cuddlie".  Granted, I've seen better ones out there, but those were all ones that someone made themselves and put a LOT of hard work and time into the creation of their plush.  Overall though, if you love that little Night Fury in the movie and want a plush of him, you can't go wrong with this one...very excellent!
Who doesn't love Elmo?? :)  Received this cute little guy today! As always, Elmo is adorable and works well. His lullabies are so cute and my special needs son will be so excited to receive him as a gift. Elmo always makes him smile! :) This was a great deal because I chose to pay a lower price for the one with a damaged box and the box isn't even damaged that bad. I will still wrap this in the original box and everyone including Elmo will be happy on Christmas morning!
He is adorable.  Sven is very well made. He is adorable.
My daughter is expecting. She had this when she was little.
Way better than expected  This is probably the cutest Flareon plush I've seen. Yes it is small. I purchased it with the trick pose sitting Jolteon. Both are excellent in terms of quality and they really look good. I'll be uploading photos of them to the listing as well but here are links to the photos just in case.  https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10421611_10152683433009207_3510776170875088625_n.jpg?oh=dff18174eee1db62c00b21bf635394fa&oe=5480F036&__gda__=1416218656_fdab1f15cf697ebe4f6ebe179fabcc7b  https://scontent-a-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/10653759_10152683431584207_5153648963623297139_n.jpg?oh=741857f8b090f062dd40f23cf55a0114&oe=54612FBF  Really so cute!
Loves it!  My son loves this Dwebble.  He collects Pokmon plushes, and this one was a great addition to his collection.  He waited everyday, asking when the postman came, if his Dwebble arrived.  And once it did, he was thrilled.
Great For Any Age  Bought this because my son asked me to. I had bought the white blood cell for him and he had found it nice to have when learning cell structure in Biology and wanted the red cell also. We do cell's again in Zoology soon so these guys will be used again.
Awesome Alligator!!  I bought this for a pirate-themed birthday party. The kids all loved it and my son got to keep it after which he was thrilled about. Its very good quality, made well, and stood up to about 15 5-year olds throwing it around. The colors are fantastic and the size was perfect.
Great quality, fast shipping!
Looking for something to give warm hugs to? Look no further.  Great cuddly toy for anyone who loves Frozen. My son is almost two and he loves Olaf. This stuffed toy is the perfect size for little ones and is great to give warm hugs to. A must buy!
After the party I gave it to him and he was so happy. He sleeps with this stuff toy at night  I used it to decorate the table for my son's birthday. After the party I gave it to him and he was so happy. He sleeps with this stuff toy at night. Worth the price.
Tigger= Joy and Love! :-)  Perfect first Tigger for my grandson of 5 months. I love Tigger and always give my grandkids one at their first Christmas. This one? Perfect.
Perfect for Whovians!  Purchased this as a gift for my girlfriend for her birthday and she absolutely loves it. It arrived quickly and is perfect for any Doctor Who fan.
My daughter loves it!
Sooooo Soft  I bought this for my 8 year granddaughter and she loved it.  It is really the softest and so cute. She sleeps with it now. The colors are vibrant and what you can't see from the picture is a really cute, fairly long tail that enables the toy to stand upright. Well worth the price.
FLUFFY  It was good and fluffy.
Cornelius  Cornelius is our alternative to "Elf on the Shelf." He is a service elf. He only comes once or twice a week and he brings a piece of our nativity set and he brings a service for us to do. Some things we did this year were making cookies for neighbors, donating good toys we don't use anymore, and buying a gift for the giving tree.
Absolutely love it!  Absolutely love it!!!! Its a good size and the price is unbeatable. A Kirby like this you'd be paying double for at a store.
Super cute, my toddler loves him
It looks just like the original foxy plush I see no difference worth $10 thank you guys :)  Thank you so much I love it
I like it  Plush very well done, with good quality materials and good finish, my son is 4 years old and he loved this monster and his friends
I absolutely love this pikachu plush  I absolutely love this pikachu plush. It's the closest thing to a real sleeping pikachu that I could have. It has actually become my new traveling companion when I go on trips. Overall if you are a fan of pokemon or pikachu and are indecisive on getting it, I say go for it.
Great purchase for the price.
Not just for the under 2 crowd  I bought this for my 21-month-old son to use on a long flight, hoping it would occupy him for more than a few minutes.  He played happily for a little while but wanted it even more when my 5-year-old daughter took a liking to it and used it as a backpack for her baby doll.  One toy, two kids while sitting in coach.  It wasn't pleasant.  I wish I would have bought two.
Very cute- perfect for nursery item.
zim is great gift
I bought this for my nephew (4 year old) and he loves it! He calls it "bad dinosaur". He really likes that the toy has teeth and is more realistic.
Bought this for my Granddaughter. She refused to let go of it. She's too young to press the tummy herself, but loves to cuddle him and is thrilled when an adult presses it for her
My son loves it
better quality than expected!! great detail and sound box very clear. very pleased.
awesome  i got this for my disney collection and they looked brand new i love this anyone who is thinking of buying should buy
All the newborns in my extended family get a Pooh bear from me. This one is excellent even though little Sean doesn't know he has it yet.
Birthday gift suggestion? Anything Pokemon!  My grandson was delighted with his birthday gift.
My son loves it  My 4yr old loves his angry birds he plays with them all the time. Helps develop his imagination and creative side
This thing is adorable! Six year old gift recipient loves it.
my son loves it.
Excellent looking model  Fast shipping. Excellent looking model.
Love this bear!  Love this bear!
We love Minions  Received item quickly.  It is just as described.  Very cute.  Gave as a gift.
Beautiful horse!  Love it! Great plush horse!
This little guy is so cute! My son really loves super man, but he's only two years old so we weren't really ready for smaller action figures. This is something my son can cuddle and play with all the same. The price was great. I'd even buy this as a gift for some of my adult friends that are into superheros.  Very happy with my purchase.
Love it! So cute
My daughter is fascinated with buckles so this is perfect for her  My daughter is fascinated with buckles so this is perfect for her.  There are a couple ones that are smaller and require more coorindation so that both frustrates her and challenges her.  My niece had the turtle one and I think both are great so far.
Tiny but very huggable and well made in every sttich  This was loved by the whole family and is a permanent resident on out family couch as a pillow. Everyone wants to hug it. Its very small for its price, but it is well made.
Amazing!  I absolutely adore this toy! Its very soft and so cute!
BEAUTIFUL!
5 stars
he's my favorite in the movie just wish he was a little bigger
great!!!!  son loves it!!
Very nice. will do for what I need it for  Very nice. will do for what I need it for. I am going to add more buttons that are removable...as only one is removable. But worth the purchase price.
Awesome fixture  This fixture looks great integrated into any tropical dcor. Easy to install as well. My only issue (which actually worked out great) was that it was neither 13" or 16.9" long as stated in the description and title. The overall installed width is actually 15".
UglyDoll Black Ice Bat  I have a bunch of UglyDolls, so while this one was a gift for my girlfriend off her baby registry, I would highly recommend these super-cute (and let's face it, somewhat 'ugly') soft animals.
DJ Lance Rock!  He's been the subject of much discussion and awe among my three little Gabba fans. A great way to round out the set of similar figures that came out last year. His hat is fuzzy, the rest of him is smooth and a similar material to the Toodee figure. If you're interested, Leslie Hall offers a similar Leslie doll on her website, so DJ Lance can have a friend to dance with.
Loved it!
perfect gift for granddaughter who is a fan of Baby First TV
gift  gift
Perfect  Just the right for a girl to and love!
Adorable!  So adorable and life-like. I bought two of these to give to my grandnieces for Easter. Great quality. They didn't disappoint, even though they weren't the traditional Easter givings. My own daughters, who are in their 20's and 30's wanted them, as well as my sister-in-law.
Pokemon black and white series 2 6"...  well made and cute!
Everything A-Okay.
5 Stars!  While it is a little bigger than i thought it would be, it is still very cute and fluffy and that is why a give it a 5 star! p.s I am being alot nicer to him than any other plush because he is my character from Adventure Time!
A very cute and cuddly doll.  I purchased this for my two year old daughter after she received a horrifying "baby alive" for Christmas from a relative. I combed carefully through my options as I am a doll lover myself, although I've stopped colecting personally I'd love to start again with my daughter so I wanted this to be a good start for her collection. I wanted something with realistic features to help ease the transition into having a baby brother soon, but a soft body so she could snuggle it at bedtime.  This doll met and exceeded all my requirements. It has a beautifully hand painted face with delicate features, and is well made down to the stitching. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a doll for similar reasons as i, and might I add that the original kathe Kruse actually began making dolls for similar reasons (she thought the current dolls on the market were hideous!)  My only advice would be that while I opted for the larger size, ultimately I did not fond it was necessary for a young toddler, but I'm sure she will grow into it
Cute and soft.
Daughter loves this!!!!  Cute songs but took forever and a day to receive it.
My daughter loved it. Thank you  Absolutely met my expectations! My daughter loved it. Thank you.
Couldn't ask for more!  This was a steal! Mario stuff can run a bit high and I was a little afraid the quality would supper based on this price but when it arrived all my fears were washed away.  The colors are vibrant and the stitching is perfect!!
Got this for my 16 month old for car rides. He loves it, it'll be awhile before he figures it out but I can already see his mind working.
kids love it
BEAUTIFUL!!!  I bought this chime for my mother's Christmas gift last year.  It is so beautiful to look at as well to listen to.  She loves it!  GREAT PURCHASE!!
Cute frog coin pouch  Was full of fluff so I took out the fluff and now its a great coin purse. :)
My daughter loves this thing, she has it everywhere even sleep.
These are awesome. My daughter loves them.
Adorable, but arms permanently stuck in the 'Up' Position  This little bugger is cute and looks exactly as pictured. Oddly enough, due to the way it is sewn, the arms are permanently stuck in the 'Up' position; All the better for scaring!
This Giraffe is adorable! I was very pleased with this purchase  This Giraffe is adorable! I was very pleased with this purchase. Cute face, soft fur and nice size for decor at my safari baby shower. Londonvoll
Fun toys
Read the measurements. My grand loved it, but be sure you want SMALL  Cute but TINY
Perfect for display, collecting  This doll is definitely not for serious playing. Very delicate hair and dress. But for collecting, displaying... perfect. And just what I was looking for. She's beautiful and a great size.
Darling Godzilla Slippers!  My children like most like to wear character slippers around the house.  So when I received the Godzilla Slippers in the mail they were excited to  try them out.  These slippers are a plush face of Godzilla with an open mouth, sharp looking teeth, and a tongue. There is a thick plush bottom that makes a soft cushion to walk on. There is also a white tail coming out the back that glows in the dark.  You heard me right when I said that these glow in the dark. It is  kids to the glowing in the dark that makes the appeal of these fun for my children to chase each other around the house in the dark acting like a monster.  None of the kids want to see the sharp teeth and its ferocious looking eyes glowing and coming at them in the dark.  What also is nice about these slippers is that they fit a mans foot up to size 12, so it fits all of their feet and my husbands also.  These have become a wonderful additions to our families foot wear and playtime at that.  I received these for my unbiased opinion.  All opinions are my own!
cute and posable!  So so cute.  My daughter (24 yrs. old) totally loved this movie.  (me too)  so for Valentine's day I got her the Dragon holding a small box which held another surprise.  She really loved the dragon.
Great for grandchildren!
This came in super quick and it's just as I saw in the pictures. It's great!
Perfect  My daughter had a giraffe very similar to this one and it got lost. She was so happy when she opened the box to find this one in there. It's super soft and too cute! It's perfect.
Arrived lookin good. Long shipping wait but lookin good.
Really great toy my daughter loves it.
Good Value for your money  This horse is the perfect size for my son to play with his "movie size" woody doll.  It's not the plastic one that makes all the noises but it satisfies his desire to have Bullseye.  Good quality construction like you expect from Disney plushes.
Well made and great price!  Adorable and well made! My daughter loved both mermaids I purchased. I would recommed this product.
My husbands name is Elliot so we bought the book and animal to go along with it!
Well made, adorable!  This is absolutely adorable. High quality plush toy too. The cats love to cuddle with him. Took a LONG time to get here, but I guess that depends on who you buy it from. KYLE!
Little Buddy  Just as advertised!
Don't Let The Rattle Dissuade You!  Yes, there is a "rattle", but it is not loud or annoying. It is more of a light tinkling. I love that it's organic since my son sucks the ears. This is his lovey in his crib and when I put him down for his naps or at night he immediately rolls to his side and hugs his Pooh! It's light enough for a baby to maneuver but solid enought that I'm not worried about leaving it in his crib while he's sleeping. Plus the tinkling is nice to hear over the monitor to let me know he's awake!
Great product. Great Price. Would Buy Again. Worth the wait.
A Good Net  There's a stream that runs through our property, and our daughter has been using this net for the past couple of months catching fish, frogs and salamanders (those she can't catch with her bare hands). She's very satisfied with the net, and so am I. It's strong, and I don't have to tell her to go easy on it. It will last at least two summers, if not more.
she loved  Was a gift, she loved it
Great plush Hello Kitty for little kids  Nice size, well-made, soft, and good value.  Face is stitched/embroidered and not plastic parts, so safer for littler ones.
Came on time and product was as expected.
Loved it!  This was for my Daughter, and she adored this little thing! It was worth it to her, she was happy, so it was worth it. Larger then she thought it would be, and nicely made.
Really cute and a wonderful Christmas gift
Cute!  my niece is obsessed with frozen and loves this doll! it talks too!
My son loves it!!!
She'll love  My 3 year old granddaughters bday next Monday. She'll love it
LOVE THESE!  LOVE THESE!!! Bought during an amazon flash sale and I'm so happy with the purchase!!  Doll was larger then I would have expected for the price, and the quality and sound are great!  These are a must have for your little Inside Out fan!!!
We love Little Giraffe products!  We absolutely LOVE this giraffe! Incredibly soft and just adorable! Little Giraffe brand is awesome for everything, including heir plush animals 
Look great but haven't opened them. Christmas gifts

Great Plush!  I got all of the 5" Angry Bird Star Wars plush as a Christmas gift for my 7 year old and they are going to be a great addition to his collection!!  Very nicely done!
Just what I wanted  Perfect addition to my grand daughter's collection . Will make one little girl very happy for her second birthday .
Great for any Elmo fan
Thank you
great present for any bleach fan-girl  bought this for a friend on her birthday and she just loves the thing to death. would have been better is the visor was removable but what ever.
Love Sulley. I bought it for my son because it is his class' pet. It is very soft and cuddly.
Minecraft plush collectible  My sons love minecraft and got it at for a terrific price !
well made and adorable, will be a hit with any pokemon fan  well made and adorable, this is one of my child's favorite Pokmon and is very pleased, well made and shipped quickly.
Granddaughter loves it. Just as discribed
My own night fury  We enjoy the posable wings, making it easy for our Night Fury to take flight. But he is soft and cuddly too!
This was a present for my 6 year old niece who absolutely adored it. The company was a pleasure to deal with.
So cute  He is adorable and very soft.
Great gift, well made. Thank you!
Adorable!  My granddaughter loved it!  Made Christmas morning extra special.  Pricey, but very cute.  Looks just like the yearly special about Rudolph.
Loved it. Thanks
Good price!
Exactly what we were looking for  My daughter loves Elmo.  We bought this one as a spare.  She does. Not go anywhere without this small Elmo.  Perfect for little hands.
Good material, very fast. My goddaughter exciting
Perfect
Nice toy!  Elmo is popular in my household. So this was a purchase we made as soon as they hit shelves. My son who is 2 enjoys playing with Elmo. Here are some highlights about this toy, 1. Elmo has 4 interactive play modes 2. Interact with Elmo by tickling him, bouncing him, or squeezing his nose 3. Elmo plays "Prince Elmo Says" 4. Elmo counts up to 20 with your little one 5. Elmo plays a sounds-of-the-sea identification game. Worth the price. Nice toy!
Perfect for travel  I got this for our toddler when we go traveling and it was been very useful. She uses it as a pillow if she falls asleep in the car and it was very easy to put into our stroller basket and pull it out and use the blanket when she decided to fall asleep and nap in the stroller. This is a great product because with everything you need to bring on a trip this is a 2 in 1 combo of blanket and/or pillow. The blanket was big enough to use on the hotel bed too so I didn't need to use the rough bedding the hotel provided. I bought another for our baby so each child has their own.
Great seed without filler, crappy dyes, and preservatives!  I went to PetSmart one day to buy bird seed, and I decided to really look at each ingredient in each bag. I was very surprised to find so much food coloring in seed! Even yellow #5 and #6, which have been proven to be unhealthy for humans! Every single brand under $2/LB had these dyes and/or preservatives; even the brands that looked premium. How stupid! Only the ridiculously expensive had great ingredients. This is the limitation of brick-and-mortar stores is that they only usually carry the most popular brands, not necessarily the best or healthiest while remaining affordable. Its all marketing and whoever does the best marketing wins shelf space.  So, I decided to research seed online, and after a few hours, this is the BEST value for basic seed with the least amount of additive garbage for the price. There are no filler pellets, dried fruits, or veggies which are typically dyed. My birds just toss them out of their feeder anyway, they hate the filler garbage that companies add. So, now I have 25lbs of what my birds will eat %100 of, not toss out %20 of it, and they no longer have to ingest unhealthy dyes that companies stupidly add to pet food. My birds don't care about the neon pellets and old dried fruit; they just toss them out!  So, the bottom line after much research is that if you want the most economical and least toxic in one package, this is what I found to be it. As a daily meal for a healthy active bird, this has enough nutrition to keep them healthy. I wouldn't feed this solely to my bird if they were sick; then I would buy some extra loaded seed that has more nutrition and possibly some vitamin supplements for their water too. Just make sure you have room to store so much seed since it will sit for awhile!
Too Cute  I got 3 different wall mounts for my Son's nursery and I must say they are way to cute. I absolutely love them all 
Great buy!!!  It was a great buy. Definately something for a pokemon fan. I bought it for my girlfriend for her birthday and she loved it. The only problem was I think it was a bit overpriced. Everything else about this item was fantastic!
Awesome!  There is not much to be said about the quality of a plush, other than it is well made and doesn't fall apart. The selling point for me is simply that I love the way it looks.  I got it for my girlfriend, who enjoys Legend of Zelda games, and she absolutely adores it. It makes a great gift for adults and children; she is an adult, but the sentimental value combined with the fact that it represents something she is very fond of makes it irreplaceable to her. She misplaced it for a few days and was heartbroken until she found it. It is a good inexpensive gift for anyone who enjoys the Legend of Zelda series..
Great Stuffie  Really soft and the perfect size for snuggling. Very well made stuffie.
Perfect recovery gift  I earned this recently after mine was electively taken.... This is very cute as a gag gift for anyone recovering from surgery... They have lots of other organs too.
This is a favorite of my grandson!
Good quality. As described and fast shipping.
Lovely print  I purchased this for a friend and she seemed very pleased with it.

This is so great for kids to buckle and unbuckle over and over. Love this!
Official Minecraft Overworld 7" Creeper & Enderman  My kid started getting the "baby" minecraft animals from Target/Walmart. I didn't even notice the "baby" or size part, but did look into it when wanting to order these. I was afraid they'd be too small or large to match his store-bought ones.  They were perfect. Mine were also sewn together well and my son loves them along with three others he already owns.  Soft, well assembled, matched perfectly with the baby pig, bat, and baby cow he has.
Love this plush!  I wanted this plush for my great niece and couldn't find it in stores any longer.  I was happy to find it here, It's a good size and very soft.  She loves it!
Adorable!  It's super cute and holds quite a few coins! The stitching is a little off in some places (like the thing stitched to it's chest) but you get what you pay for and it doesn't impact how it's used. I love it!
She loved this one** This is neat -All the muppet itema I got off Amozon very good quality
Cute and cuddly  I got this for my son for his first birthday because he loves the llama llama books. Now he loves his llama llama and little llama. It is nice that the clothes don't come off because we would have lost his pjs by now. A great gift for any llama llama fan.
My son loved this.
Great quality plush!  This plush's quality is perfect for the price!  Miku is extremely detailed and well-made.  Definitely better than smaller anime plush I've owned, as she is fully finished and ready for play.  Overall I think she's great for the money, collectors and fans alike will love her!
Verry fun  It's a fun toy, I love the things you do and the amount of things to learn.  While many spent batteries, so I chose to buy rechargeable 2600 mah and maxing solved (4 AA batteries every 6 days).  still recommended.
and it looks just like the image  very soft, and it looks just like the image. it has great quality and is very cute. my mom bought this for me and i love it. the string is very strong. i recommend this if your child is into plants vs zombies and wants a plush.
Perfect for young children.  This is just adorable. Great quality, and just the right size to take along on an outing. We bought one at Disneyland, but it was lost or left behind on the plane. I was thrilled to find another one on Amazon. My granddaughter was so happy when it arrived in the mail.
Great Quality  I stumbled upon this at around 2AM one night and sleep-deprived me thought it was a good idea to purchase it. Fast forward two days later and he's sitting in front of my monitor while I type this review. He's adorable, soft, and very well made. This plush is well worth the price. Do yourself a favor and buy it while you can.
Super cute. My 8 year old loves it  Super cute.  My 8 year old loves it.
My granddaughter loved it!

Llama Llama series of books  I bought five different Llama  Llama series books for my grandchildren.  Reports from my daughter is that they were well received by mom and kids alike!
Light up a face with Stich the loveable Disney plush toy  This was the hit for our Godson, his face light up when he opened his Christmas present to see his childhood friend Stitch.  Even the cat loves to cuddle with Stitch.
Cutest Pokemon ever  This is an amazing stuffed animal.  It's large (but not too large), cuddly and adorable.  It has a long tail with a plush ball on the end.  It is just so cute!  My son loves Marriland's Pokemon walkthroughs so he will love this!
Great Purchase  Babies and children like Winnie The Pooh and teddy bears.  My nephew really likes this Winnie The Pooh Teddy Bear and glad I bought this for him.  He likes it and it's very nice.
Bolt...LIFESIZE!!! :D  My 23" Bolt is LIFESIZE! He is so CUTE and SOOFFTT! He definitely makes it as one of my top favorite plushies. Stop reading and go buy him! :)
Speedy delivery!  So cute! Great quality doll, speedy delivery. Thanks!
I like listening to him  As with the other characters I purchased, I like listening to him talk
Cute plush for anyone who like pirates or cats  This product was a great quality plush. My girlfriend loves it. He sits up on her bed every day.
BOO!  Boo is a great little toy for toddlers. My niece a little over one year, and she is totally in love with this dog. She keeps on kissing and hugging him. Boo is so love-able.
Super  My kid Loves it! Super soft
My nephew loves it.
Llama  Great! Just as expected! My son loves it! Looks just like the books. If anything it could have been bigger, kids like stuffed animals they can squeeze and love on.
crazy soft and super cute but smaller then i expected; still very pleased.
He is very happy.  Son loves it. He is very happy.
He will love it. I gave him Kris Bryant last year  This was a request by my grandson for a Christmas gift. He will love it. I gave him Kris Bryant last year.
very cute and soft  cute, ordered because it looks like our doodle, grandson loves to cuddle with it!
Finally I got it from Swiss Post this morning. Thank you I love it very much ^_^
... was a gift and I was told it was nice and soft  The bunny was a gift and I was told it was nice and soft.
Adorable! Great quality.  Adorable! Great quality. Perfect size. Used on a dessert table for an elephant themed baby shower. Perfect accent. Then given as a gift for the little one.
My son loved this toy. Soft like velvet.
Basically a perfect fennekin plushie you get what you pay for.  Very Very large and very cute as well...its pretty much the exact size this fox is in the anime and would be in real life. Though foxes in real life don't have heads that big in proportion to its body, well it makes it even cuter. It towers over all my 12 inch plushes of various other pokemon even the I love eevee series which is mostly pretty big...and way over all of my action figures. Its adorable and also very well sown and looks like it will last a long time. Even if not used as a plaything, its gigantic size makes it a perfect figure to place anywhere in your house and look at.  Other then eevee which also got a life size version of itself (its smaller though then fennekin since eevee in the anime and game is pretty tiny though) and the other gen 5 starters which are comparability huge...well there really hasn't been to many other of my favorite pokemon that got like size versions of themselves only 6-12 inch versions. So a huge plushie like this is hard to come by especially one this well done and also true to the anime/game without any defects. If you want the best of the best fennekin plushie well you have to pay a lot of money for one but its worth it if thats what you are looking for.
Great Gift Idea.  My girlfriend is addicted to the Minions.  Purple is her favorite color.  This is a no-brainer.  Win win for me!
mermaids!  my grand  daughter loves it!
Great!
Keeps them busy  I bought one for each of my twins and they are so entertained with this, it's amazing! They will be so focused on buckling everything and I just unbuckle everything and they continue. That process lasts a good while before they get bored. It really helped on the plane ride. I recommend this to any parent with a toddler. My girls are almost 2.
Lady's plush  Very nice furry toy of baby Lady from "Lady and the Tramp", my kid just love it. She has a nice blanket to wrap her in.
nice stuffy.  His tail is on with velcro and a tie so it won't get lost
So cute!
TED RULES!!  It's Rasta TED
excellent  very good, excellent, happy child, I recommend to all funny furry angry bird, you can use the ball, child is happy
1.5 yr old loves  Yes
My kids love it.  I bought this as a gag gift - my son (age 7), however, has latched on to it, and carries it with him around the house.  It has survived a fair amount of abuse, and isn't bald yet, so I'm impressed.  Does cause children to growl at each other.
he loved it.  I bought it for my nephew, he loved it.
V-TECH CORA THE SMART CUB PLUSH TOY, PINK  TOO, TOO CUTE! YOU WILL WANT THIS FOR A SWEET HEART OF A CHILD IN YOUR WORLD. IT HAS A NICE AMOUNT OF FEATURES TO KEEP THAT LITTLE ONE BUSY FOR QUITE SOME TIME. WITH V-TECH THERE ARE NO REGRETS.
My daughter loves it!  I love this product, my daughter has recently become fascinated with buckles and this is the perfect toy to satisfy that curiosity! I was unable to find anything remotely close to it in any stores near me. Thank you for the great product!
MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW COLLECTS TINKER BELLS AND SHE JUST LOVED IT.

plush girl elf  This brought more joy to my granddaughter that anything she received for christmas.  It was special then and still is.  She had the only girl elf.
kids love it
Great Idea  I bought this for my 5 year old and she just loves it. It seems to be pretty durable. She put two stuffed animals and a few other small things in it and there was still room for one more thing. Great product!
great toys for young children
So cute, plush and cuddly.
My son loves it and looks great in his minecraft bedroom  My son loves it and looks great in his minecraft bedroom! Soft and plush and exactly 12 inches tall. Packaged well and shipped fast. Would recommend .
this is a birthday gift so I know she'll love it
It is the official XY Tomy plush. It has the tag, and does not appear to be a bootleg.
So cute  I bought this at Walmart andJoy looks adorable. The 5 emotions look cute in traditional animation. I've been using stickers on messenger and thought of getting Joy.
Singin' Unicorn Pony  Very cute... a little smaller than I pictured, but it walks and sings a fun little song (is a gift for my niece, not sure how I'd feel about hearing the song over and over if it was at my house, ha ha, but you can always take the batteries out.)
Moose Head hit  This was a "joke" gift for a hunter friend in the Upper Peninsula in Michigan. He loved it!
Perfect size and looks like the picture. Well made.
She loved it.

Great toy for those who love toy story  I got this for my 6 year old and she loves it.  Its really big and plush.  The slinky part is soft too.  Great toy for those who love toy story!
Extremely soft and cuddly  Ghasts are my favourite mobs in Minecraft and these plushes are large and very fluffy. I especially adore the simplistic yet quintessential design.
Gift for Grandson  Grandson spotted the Chewbacca Back Buddy at Disneyland during a recent visit and really liked it but it was expense. I went on line and found this item on Amazon for $15 cheaper. It always pays to search for better prices and free shipping is always a bonus if I can find it (most of the time on Amazon).
very cuties will buy more
Daughter loves him  This was adorable unlike all the Sophia dolls which look creepy. Well made and cute. My daughter sleeps with him every night and loves him!
My Grandson loves it.
Cute animated stuffed animal!  This was the cutest animated stuffed animal!

good doing business with you  Thank you... good doing business with you! Fast shipping!
works as expected  didn't have a problem out nof this product, my daughter loves it
great!  better than expected  fast delivery
Q*bert!!!!!  I love this. It received a few negative reviews because it has a suction cup and string. I have wanted a plush Q*Bert since the game first came out many moons ago and for less than $10, I figured I would take the risk. He was far, far better than I was expecting. He's adorable and well made. I cut off the string because I'm not hanging him in a window to fade. He was also a good deal larger than I thought he might be. Very pleased!
Completely Satisfied.  It is just as we expected. Love this little guy.
I love it
daughter loves her1
Very nice
Yo Gabba Gabba 13"plush Brobee, Muno, and Foofa  Fash shipping I bought it for my 2 yrs old son he like yo gabba gabba his favorite one is brobee. They look great i gave foofa to my niece and she plays with it everyday.

The softest!  My first graders love Rocket, especially when they hear his books read aloud.  He is a great "reading buddy" in class.  VERY soft and looks just like the illustrations.

My son loves this plush toy
Very pretty wind spinner, well packaged, delivered on time, thanks so much!
very cute
Kinda needs better support for the head, but super adorable  Its neck does not support the head very well, but other than that, it's super adorable.
adorable!
1/4 inch hex adapter to 3/8 inch 24 chuck  this worked great for the chuck that i recently purchased for taking larger taps. assembled in seconds. goes right into drill
He is my squishie and no one else's  as an avid fan of the Kingdom Hearts series, i just had to get one of my favorite heartless ^_^ and so i did....he was actually delivered before the estimate delivery which impressed me and he is just sooo cute ^_^....what is not mentioned....unless they changed it...is that his eyes actually GLOW!!!! when i was going to bed the first night with my shadow heartless....the glowing suprised me and made me think for a split second "OYFG!!!! they sent me a real heartless... o_o" ....after i turned my lights on and off for a couple of minutes i concluded that his eyes just glowed ^_^'........yea, half asleep when trying to figure this out......anyways, the only thing that just slightly annoy's me is the antennas....they contain wire for form and if not careful they can sink into the shadow's head and be quite difficult to pull back into the antenna...when they sink they leave the cloth used for the antenna limp and in the way...thats the only problem...and if you have furry animals, don't let them get near, hair does show up on it....overall, it's a good plushie ^_^
So cute!
really cute and I love the fabric  This item is exactly what you see, really cute and I love the fabric. My baby will lover her elephant bear.
Wonderful soft doll!  I book this for my niece along with the book.  It was a big hit and she sleeps with this doll every night.
Cute Pilliw  Very cute. Small in size.
Excellent
So amazing  They feel like the expensive ones. Usually for the 6inch its like 20 dollars in stores. I love them.   
This soft, sweet little guy was purchased for our brand new great grandson.
My granddaughters loved them!
Great Furby  Has some features that are obviously different than the original ones, but my daughter enjoys it when she wants to. She uses it also with the older ones and they talk and are all weird lol. Got it for a great price, couldn't pass up.
An adorable stocking stuffer.
nice  Nice large Pokemon toy my son loves it and plays with it all the time, good purchase I would recommend for a child who loves pokemon toys
Best Fluffy Cow  Adorable and super soft cow! My son loves cows and I thought this one was one of the best "fluffy cows" out there. Very realistic, nice color, perfect face and totally hug-able. His hair almost matches my sons wild auburn hair too. I think he will be a nice new sleeping companion for my 3y old.
Nice quality  My son collects Pokemon plush and this is a nice addition to his collection.  The toy is high quality and seems durable.  The shipping was surprisingly fast too!
Perfect  It's a very soft stuffed animal,met expectations, got there on time. Recommended!! :D  anybody who needs a gift for a special someone here it is
It was adorable.  Baby loved it!
so cute, soft and cuddly!  this was a purchase for a friend of mine who is having a baby in feb so it was part of her shower gift as her theme being monsters inc! the user shipped it in great time and packaged well. sully is a very soft and cuddly stuffed animal. it was great for the price, i didn't want to spend a lot as i got mike as well and some other things for her. he is so cute and she also absolutely loved him i would definitely recommend this whether its for you or just a gift it would be great for someone of any age who likes monsters inc or loves stuffed animals!
I bought this for my granddaughter's birthday and will give it to her on her birthday I loved this doll and I am sure she is going to love it as well.
Big kid at heart  Love my Tweetybirds.  I have bought two and keep them on my bed with a big Sylvester the cat.
Just perfect!  Got this for my 3 year old granddaughter while she waits for her "real" mini schnauzer to arrive in a few weeks. Very soft and just the perfect size to cuddle!
Cute
Little kids LOVE it.  My 2 and 5 year olds love everything about this. He's soft (with a fabric covered plastic bottom so he can sit up), he sings the whole song, and he is adorably ugly. 5 stars, would definitely buy again.
Good buy  Although this isn't the "hit" toy of the bunch, my daughter does like it. It'll hold her focus and shell attempt the buckles. I'm glad I bought this still. And see this being something bmy daughter will like more as she develops.
Great for the price
My kid will love this! I still have my popple!
Super Cute!!!!!!!!  I absolutely love my new Princess Serenity Plush!!!! It shipped quickly and was packaged well! The plush is very true to the picture and is superrrrr soft!!!!
very cute and soft
Very cute...  These little animals are just darling. They are so soft and perfect size. Great for customizing or just keeping the way they are. Definately reccomend!
Cute
Awesome deal on popular item.  Awesome stuffed toy, very cute.
The Webkinz are fun! There's a huge variety and the online world is fun too!
My daughter slipped this little guy into my shopping cart and I "accidentally" bought it but she loves him so much that it was well worth it.
So cute.  My daughter was Boo for Halloween and carried him around as part of her costume!
This was a great gift for my 6 & 10 yr old sons!  Good quality and just as described. My boys have all of the plushies now and make YouTube videos of the dolls interacting!
we love mynus!!!!!!  ready for a touching story? when my son was 12 months old, we got him a mynus doll at PDX on our way to a cousin's wedding. he reached for it in the gift shop and got snot on it so we paid like 18 bucks for it. luckily, he loved it and played with it a lot.  fast forward 8 months, we took mynus with us to france on a family vacation because my guy had to have him in his crib every night. welllllll, somewhere between amsterdam and portland we lost mynus on the way back and no calls to delta or PDX could get him back to my guy, who was devastated. this mama was SO SAD for her buddy.... until, six months later, mynus showed up on my "recommended for you" portion on amazon, and he was $2. TWO DOLLARS. i bought him instantly and when he arrived in the mail, my son was so happy he could barely even handle it. my guy is now four and still needs his mynus in his bed with him every night.
Really nice quality product  Edit: My 10 month old is now an 18 month old who WILL NOT PUT THIS TOY DOWN! Seriously, this is the most loved toy. I'm ready to buy a different one to keep us entertained on our first cross country trip. It hasn't shown a bit of wear despite constant use.  Really nice quality product. Purchased for my 10 month old who loves to eat all manner of buckles. Can't wait for him to get older so he can use the toy as intended. Confident it will last.
Love it!  Great quality, I will only buy from this company because the plushes that I bought from here are the best ones.
Can barely survive without him.  This stuffed bear became my baby girl's most favorite companion when she was just five or six months old.  She would soothe herself by wriggling the bee's crinkly wings.  Now, six months later, the crinkle is so worn out it is just about non-existent, and the bee has come apart from Winnie's left paw, but the toy is still Lexi's absolute favorite friend.  He's been thru the wash machine and dryer twice and the squeak still works, which catches Lexi's attention immediately every time.  To stock up in case of loss, I purchased another Winnie, a Tigger, and an Eeyore.  Winnie is still Lexi's favorite, with Eeyore in second place.  I wish Disney kept making these so more people could have them.
Great idea.  My grand daughter is going to wear this out, loves the CD that came with it.  Great idea.
Thanks
cute and soft  Cute, cuddly and well made
This has surpassed the Teddy Bear as my kid's favorite snuggle toy  We love the Pete the Cat series and found the idea of the Pete the Cat puppet charming. His outfit payshomage to 2 of the books, I love my white shoes and Pete the Cat and his four groovy buttons. The puppet is soft, sturdy and well-made, brightly colored and loyal to the colors in the books.
Absolutely Great :)  Omg my son absolutely loves this toy! He makes sure he has it with him before he takes a nap :) he loves Dispicable Me!
Cuddly little guy to pull together my little mans nursery.
2nd Funniest Toy in the World!!  This is by far the 2nd funniest toy (closely behind tickle me elmo in 1st place!)my nipper now owns. Recommended for adults & kids alike, a real classic!!!
Favorite paw patrol  Favorite paw patrol for my grandson. He loves it.
Son loved it for his birthday!  Son loved it
I love it amazing
So adorable!!!  So cute!!! My daughter is going to be so happy in her birthday!!!
Very sturdy  Small but not tiny All very sturdy..i made a sponge bob tree In able to find in stores
I looked in stores to find a second one, and was not successful.  This was exactly what I was looking for.
Giant bone cell  I gave this to my friend who has a bone infection in her toe. I think it cheered her up. That's what I was going for. It is a cute little fuzzy soft stuffed thing. What's not to love?
Simba  So soft & cute 
Fantastc Product  I have used this now for about 2 months, after 23 years of cycling through many red hair color conditioning products, and this is by far the most effective. It does not deposit color, but it greatly helps preserve the intensity of the color and slows fading. (It is also important to use a color-depositing shampoo for red hair in conjunction.) It has made my hair very glossy, shiny and healthier looking, and it detangles effectively. It seems to thicken each hair strand. Amazing stuff!
So soft and a great size and quality!
Cute!!!!!!  Cute !!!!!!
and she loved it!  Got it for my niece, and she loved it!!!!! Some reviews said that the plush had stains, BUT those are not stains,,, ajajaj it's part of the decoration!!!!
Highly recommended .  Easy to install. Directions clear and concise.
Great toy for toddlers  This is my sons favorite toy! We got it for his second birthday two weeks ago and he wants to take it everywhere with him.
Great toy. Getting another  Buckles seem to fascinate toddlers. Good small motor skill practice.
Highly recommend
I highly recommend this piggie cause it's spotted that makes it unique  Very cute and soft. I highly recommend this piggie cause it's spotted that makes it unique.
Giant Microbes are as pointless as they are awesome! Either a toy snake or deadly disease  Giant Microbes are as pointless as they are awesome! Either a toy snake or deadly disease, they are neato. High quality stitching and darn cute. The entire line reminds me of the Beanie Baby craze. Each one is marked with a sewn on tag and removable paper tag.
Thank you!!!!  My grandson loved 'em. Definitely worth the money!
I love this stuffed animal  I love this stuffed animal. Every year I buy my 5 kids a stuffed animal for Christmas! They always look forward to seeing what kind of stuffed animal I've picked out! This one is adorable! My daughter is gonna love it! The picture doesn't do it justice. I ordered it in September, the expected delivery date was  in the beginning of October. It got it 3 days after I ordered it! I will definitely be ordering of this shops other cute animals!
Bought for gift.
Bought it for my girlfriend's daughter and she loved it. Perfect.
Good quality toy  Everybody loves Sulley! This guy takes a lot of abuse, but he just keeps smiling.
He Loved It!  This was a present for My Grandson's Birthday, He Loved It!!!
Baby loves it!
Kids loved it.
loveable  Sweet  soft  love the baby
They're the best and hold up very well  What can I say about Dixie plates especially the Ultra. They're the best and hold up very well. Would highly recommend. Seller was great.
Its awesome! It does not look like the picture but it looks better and this is a 10 year old writing this. AWESOME FOR CHARIZARD LOVERS.
Good quality  Nice quality plushie. Looked just like the picture. Made of high quality minky
item was as described. can't wait for my kids to open it on christmas day.
Wonderful!
It will make your toddler happy  My 3 year old loves it. It is a good size, not a tiny little plush. Looks just like George.
Great toy!  This is an awesome toy. It satisfies my toddler's need to buckle and unbuckle things. The buckles are easy enough that she can unbuckle them but not so easy that they just slip open. It's really perfect and worth the money!
very cute does not hold a lot of change though.
A Christmas to remember  I bought it as a present for my daughter so I can't say too much about it except it is more adorable than the picture.  I was very happy and I'm sure she will be too.
Possibly the best frozen dolls around. Well made, detailed, large. Envy of the neighborhood.
Vegeta  Great product any Vegeta fan would approve
Yea!  I received exactly what I needed for my classroom.  The Beanie Babies are in perfect condition,
My child loves this to play with the other Mario plush.
Worth it   This was so adorable I got this for my brother and he loves it 100 percent but agin
Good size !!! Good for kids
And this Elmo is so soft and cuddly!
Everyone loved it!
Perfect gift for my wife!  Perfect gift for my wife!
Very cute
loved it so soft  and cute !
Mary Meyer is great!  Mary Meyer products have been consistently good. This one is as it appears : a delightful, female fox wearing a dress  with a bow on her head. It is a great toy for  toddler girls, and it is very soft as well. It has been a joy to see how much the recipient has loved the item already. I have not purchased any Jellycat items, but I hear they are very good and quite soft ,too. I would buy Meyer Meyer items again. We are big fans here.
Great product.  Daughter loved it.  You can stick in the washer to wash and still in one piece.  Would recommend this product.
Quality Product  I got this for Christmas for my brother and we were pleased with the product.  Definitely get these for family/friends who are fans of Pokemon, more specifically Eevee evolutions.  Pros: -quality material -nothing was dirty, torn, or lost -looks like the Pokemon -came quickly (just in time for Christmas!)  Cons: -nothing comes to mind at the moment (brother has not complained about product either)
my son loves his elmo
So cute and soft!  Bought this elephant and the Bedtime Originals Monkey to decorate the beverage table at a baby shower and then gave them as gifts to the Grandparents to be for their nursery. Both the monkey and giraffe are so soft and cuddly - and so well-made! Would much rather decorate with something that can be used for a long time, rather than paper decorations that often only have one use. Will definitely buy again!
Leprechaun  Best leprechaun
great product
my grandchild loved it
FABULOUS  Amazing! SO soft and fluffy. I love that they added his gem! Only complaint is the star on his shirt was a little scratched. Other than that, perfection!
my like it great
Great quality! Love this toy! When my kid gets tired of it I will keep it for myself!
I love Fuli she is fun and soft and if you notice she has a hart on her for head and exactly what her picture saids
LOVE IT  I love Sailor Moon and I am a big Tuxedo Mask fan. This little guy is super cute. He is a perfect size, and there is a lot of detail on him. Perfect item for any Sailor Moon/Tuxedo Mask fan!

Durable  Daughter loves these things. Wont let go of them. Pretty durable for ikea stuff
LOVE
This guys have adorable eyes!  I love this guy! It is so cute and a perfect size - not too big so that it doesn't take up a significant space on my bed - I am on college double bed - but again so cute and big enough that I don't lose it under my pillow or in between my blankets.
Cute monkey
Really Cute!
So cute and they hold hands!!  My daughter loved these. They are really cute. Please check the size though because they aresmall. A little bigger than Beanie Babies. My daughter loves that their hands are magnetic so that they hold hands.

Very nice and well made plushy!  Extremely satisfied with this purchase!

Awesome  My son was thrilled with this for Christmas and I thought the quality was great. It is holding up well so far and he plays with it all the time so I think we will continue to be pleased.
Starting School  I used this stuffed toy while presenting Llama Llama Misses Mama for the first day of school.  Even though he is not a puppet, the children watch him while I read the story.  Many of them can relate to his anxiety; being new to the school experience.
good price good quality
Nice stuffy for the price  I was surprised at the quality, as good as a plush Freddy I ordered costing 3x as much.
how can you NOT think the Rabbids are cute?
Adorable!  My husband and I bought this for our nephew's first birthday as well as the books.  My husband farms and we were looking for a plush red tractor to give him.  We came across this by accident, never have heard of the books before.  It is the perfect size and the story is adorable.
Just what she wanted  My daughter was so happy on Christmas morning to find her little blue seahorse it is small and the perfect size!
Super cute!  Arrived in clean package, brand new. Super cute!
Good Mario plush  Well made, and came in on time
Great Liitle Toy  I bought this for my little chihuahua to play with. It's not a dog toy but can be used with supervision. He loves it, especially when it pants and starts to walk.
my niece loves it  great for small kids who are into sailor moons because they can take it anywhere with them, and sleep with it. my 4 year old niece loved it
Kids loved it  Kids loved it
My boys loved these!  As a surprise I ordered these for my sons. They were a really great price and shipped quickly. They were a little smaller than I expected but good quality. The boys keep saying how soft the are.
Mario Lover!  My son absolutely loves anything Mario. This was a nice size and quality. Cheaper than at B&N.
love it!  Arrived just as grumpy as expected...love it!
Ok  Ok
My Grandson has "Gary" at home and sleeps with him. Grandma had to have one also, now nap times are more fun
My friend uses it as a guard dog and her cats love it!  It's such a great plushie and well made.
Kids loved it. The pup was decent in size and is still sitting in their room watching over them.

LOVE THIS!
2nd generatiom  my daughter loved it when she ws young.  her son loves it now.
Good product, very satisfied
A beloved toy already! Even went thru washer.
My son's loved!!
Love the Kirby plush!  Sure, this little guy is quite small, but my nephew loved it. This little buddy Kirby plush is what he wanted for his birthday, along with the meta knight, and I couldn't be more satisfied when it came in. What really mattered was that my nephew appreciated the smaller things, and I was glad to have got him this gift. It's so cute!
Great stuffy  Almost as good as he one at the Disney store ... And the price is right! The fingernails and toenails are the only thing that are flimsy. Stitching is great and this thing will last forever.
Nice to have the girl Mario characters represented.
Yesss  Very cute and creepy bear. My daughter loved it. It is expensive but worth the price for "golden" Freddy.
My daughter loves her new dolls!  My daughter loved these! She's been watching the Strawberry Shortcake shows on Netflix and she loves making her dolls act out the episodes. It would have been cool, though, if they smelled like fruit!
My Granddaughter loves it!  The baby carries it with her everywhere and plays with it all the time. That's good enough for her grandparents!
The Raichu is a very nice size, not too big or too small  The Raichu is a very nice size, not too big or too small.  It is very soft and very squishy which is nice considering most pokemon plush are very firm and not very hug-able.  The material is very soft.  The only concern might be that if you are ordering this for a small child who rough plays with toys the little curls on Raichu's ears could be damaged or ripped off.  For snuggling and cuddling there should be no issues though.  The tail in the back curls around which is very cute and correct to the anime and games.  I am very pleased with this purchase, even though the price was quite high.
Love this pot ! Cooks good, non stick Handles Nicely  This completed our T fall set in the Matisse.  WE have been extremely happy with this set.  It is very pretty and stylish, a good weight. Not too heavy but also not too light.  The handle curve makes the easy to move around.  This is non stick and it lives up to that.  There has been no peeling of the non stick and never has with any of the T Fal we have used.  Very please with this pot.
Just cute
great toy for kids  Son loves it but said not suppose to have a cape on him (on Kirby's back)
Great
good product  Necessary for LP mic lugs. You use the 'z-rod' with the LP mic lugs and you have a complete conga microphone system.
Beautiful doll. My granddaughter loved it
Deep, Full Bass  While doing the usual research for an item like this, I came across an unusual amount of silence - it seems subwoofers aren't discussed much on the web outside of a few forum favorites.  I contacted Klipsch directly and debated the merits of a few of their different models, and it came down to two - this one and the 12" SW-112. I am sure the SW-112 wouldn't have been a bad choice, but the XW-500d is simply amazing. Deep lows that aren't boomy, but are naturally room filling - a great match to my Acoustic Research speakers with built-in 8" subs. The 21 Hz vs 26 and five year warranty vs the two year for the SW-112 helped seal the deal.  I couldn't be any happier - music sounds a bit fuller (when compared to my 8" AR sub this replaced) but movies make the room vibrate. I literally had to walk around the room fixing closet doors that rattled...
Really cute and soft.
they are nice
Cute  Much bigger than I thought it would be. But it is also much cuter in person.
So Cute  Good price and very cute, Using for my son's 1st birthday monster party! It is also a good size doll.
Love it so much I ordered two!
gift  This was a gift for my future neice who loves dragons and loves the movie How to train your dragon so this set was a big hit
Fantastic seller!!! Highly recommend.
My 18mo old niece LOVED this toy!
Rocket plush toy  I was very pleasantly surprised to have Rocket be so soft & fuzzy. This is unusual in a small stuffed toy animal. His features are such that he looks just like the Rocket character in the books.
This was for my grandson who so enjoys the Ugly Doll you tube videos.
Amazing!
Bought these as prizes/give-aways for our Chinese New Year Celebration for work (Year of the Sheep).  They were small, but REALLY cute.  I wanted to take one home for myself!
great for the grandsons  Bought these for our young grandsons who are very much into Stars Wars. Great for them to carry around and toss to each other
Perfect stocking stuffers.
So cute  My granddaughter loves the movie Tangled so I decided to purchase Pascal for her. This toy is so soft and so adorable I'm tempted to purchase one for myself.  The seller shipped promptly and packed it well.
So cuteee!! and soft!
Amazing plush my daughter loved it so much.
super cute and soft! love it!
Its cute!  osum plush!  Its cute! osum plush!
CUTE....just read review so you can know what her hair looks like from the back  Why don't they show the 360 view of the Sailor moon plushies because I wanted to know what Jupiter looked like from the back.  BUT ANYWAY.... She has a big PLUSH ponytail and her hair bobbles are two flat round circles. NOT super creative..I DO wish that they made them 3 dimensional liker her actual hair (which I love by the way) Its nice and wavy. It would have been 10 times cuter if the bobbles were round balls though....  I also wish they didn't stick some of the sailors in poses. Her arm is stuck at her hip. Other than that...Her laces are nice and set in place so it isn't easy to untie and her color is vibrant!  I have no SERIOUS complaints..like the quality or anything...I love her... and she isn't even one of my favorite characters... but it is a well made plush and I couldn't give her less than a 5.  Also for parents who may want this for a small child...the tag says not for 15 and below on all Sailor Moon plushies.(what about 13-14 year old teenagers? are they going to swallow small parts?! ) That's a little extreme...but I just take that as...don't give it to young children. I think they really intended these plushies to be for collectors..maybe that's why they say it.
these things are adorable.  As always, these things are adorable.
Love dies that come with stamps  So cute! Love dies that come with stamps! Used with my cuttlebug
South Park Kenny Doll  My granddaughter loves the Kenny Doll, but wishes I had bought the larger doll.
son loves it. high quality and very soft
Well made, cute as can be, can't help but love it  I ordered this for my grandson for Christmas and he loved it.  He's 10 months old and it's bigger than him.  As all 10 month olds are prone to do he grabbed it and gave it a taste first thing :)  The giraffe is well made, well put together and a great stuffed animal for kids of any age.  The movable neck bends easily and stays in place.  The legs can be moved to keep the toy stable on the floor. You just can't not love this stuffed giraffe.
great price and such beautiful music
Perfect!
Entertaining and Lovable - Tons of Fun for Our Boys  We received Elmo for early review from Playskool (via Bzzagent). What a treat!  I have three boys (ages 6 years, 3 1/2 years, and 9 months) and while this toy was intended for the 3 1/2 year old, all my boys have been enjoying it.  Packaging...  Cardboard and plastic carton (mostly recyclable!) and those nifty little raffia-type ties that are pretty easy to untie or snip. It just took a couple of minutes to get Elmo out of the box.  First Impressions...  My 3 1/2 year old is definitely part of the target audience for this toy. He loved the look of him, his moving mouth, his voice. Big hit right from the get-go. My only frustration (and only con thus far) was that it took me several minutes to find the switch to turn Elmo from "Try Me" mode to "On". While the instructions clearly show that the toy is packaged in Try Me mode, they don't show where the panel is, and it is cleverly disguised. THE CONTROL PANEL IS ON THE BOTTOM OF ELMO :) There are well hidden velcro pieces attaching the fabric there (we call it Elmo's "underwear"), and the panel is underneath. Switch it to "On" and you're good to go.  Size and feel...  My son is exactly average size for his age (50th percentile 3 1/2 year old), and Elmo fits his arms perfectly. The plush is soft, and while he has a big block of mechanics inside, he still manages to feel much like a stuffed animal. My son has taken naps with him (albeit carefully). He is easy to carry around, and he sits on the edge of a shelf/dresser very easily for storage. I love that!  Playtime...  We love the hats. Most little kids like the ability to change things or dress them up, and my son is no exception. He switches hats constantly. It was no trouble for him to figure out the mechanics of changing hats, as he is on the older end of the age range, but they can get a little stuck coming off. My son's favorite hat is the captain's hat. He loves Elmo's song and will take the hat off and on to hear the song over and over. I like how the sound recognition game (captain hat) gets more complex the longer you play. My 6 year old has been caught playing it, though he's really too old for it. My 9 month old is fascinated by Elmo talking and has tried to squeeze his nose during counting game shenanigans (cowboy hat).  I can see this toy getting used for years to come.  It's still too early to make a call on battery life, but I'll update this review if it is notable. Toys with an off switch tend to do pretty well around here, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed for infrequent chances.  Any questions about Elmo, just leave a comment on this review! I think he would make a great gift for the 2-4 set this Christmas. Girl or boy. We're not usually big on character toys, but there's just something about Elmo. He's enduring.
As advertised
Cute  What can I say? It's a cute plush stuffed animal. :) Good quality. I gave it as a birthday present and the child loved it.
... this as a gift for my friend and he loved it! Its so soft and plush  Got this as a gift for my friend and he loved it! Its so soft and plush!
... was even more than I expected and my granddaughter love it so much  This item was even more than I expected and my granddaughter love it so much, thank you, this was worth it
Get It!  Will Not Disappoint!!  Gorgeous Plush!!! Ninetales is and has been my favorite pokemon since Gen. 1 and have always kept my eye out for a good quality plushie or figurine and this product does not disappoint!!!
Beautiful doll  I have purchased many plush toys for my daughter and all have been a misrepresentation of what the seller shows on the images of thr item that is beeing sold, than what you actually get whenever you get your dilivery. This is the first plush toy/ stuffed toy that I've purchased online, that looks as good delivered as it does on the picture. I'm very happy with my purchase, it is very soft and shows a high level of craftsmanship detail. Addittionally, all around a cute doll to give to my 3 year old daughter .I don't like barbies and I'm always looking for dolls that my little one can play with that is fit for her age and mind.
Very Happy!  Excellent doll with great detail. Looks the same as the picture and very soft. The grey part around the neck is movable and has to be adjusted frequently but generally stays in the proper position, but could be removed completely without much work as it is not stitched to the doll. Other then that, very happy with purchase and would recommend to any pokemon fan!
Great plush toy, very durable.  Great plush toy -- my niece loved it, and it brought back great nostalgia for her father (my brother) as well! Keep it up with the great products and I'll be looking forward to more interesting characters to surprise my niece with ;)
Soo cute and cuddly
Love our new teal Furby!  We received our teal furby boom for Christmas. My 7 year old son is in love with it! Although he held down its tongue and the voice changed to a really goofy "male" voice I was able to reset our Furby back to the factory settings. Using him with the app is so much fun my 9 year old wants one as well. They interact with each other which I thought is a clever bonus. There is no on our off button but putting him to sleep is simple and he stays asleep if you don't pull his tail. I would recommend this to anyone who's child likes to give and show affection.  Feeding, showering, taking him to the bathroom, laying eggs that hatch into furblings to care for is a blast (on the app). His reaction to foods he doesn't like is hilarious. They learn new words and do different things as you form their personality based on how you treat your Furby. 5 stars! Takes 4aa batteries.
America Plushie  I've been a fan of the Hetalia anime for a very long time now, so when I found out about the plush versions of the characters, I knew I had to have one! My America plush is an exact copy of the way the anime character looks, from his clothing to his facial expression. It is an adorable little toy-doesn't take up too much space, and is so darn cute! Fast delivery and was shipped to me in a top-notch condition.  I Absolutely love my plush, and is recommended for any die-hard fan or anyone who loves to collect plushies, as I do.
Great...
I love it!  Soft, cute and it was bigger than I expected! Great design, im tempted to buy some of the other ones.
My 5 yr old son loved it!
OMG, I found it.  This is a Christmas present.  It is exactly what I was looking for. I'm sure she'll be surprised. Many thanks, Fastest shipping ever.
Adorable, Snazzy Rin Plushie! Love him so much!   I previously purchased the Rei "Free!" plush on Amazon, and was very pleased with him. Then I found my second favourite character, Rin, at my local f.y.e. store, much to my delight. I don't watch anime, but I love collecting anime plushies of boy hero characters. Anyone can enjoy these excellently-made plush toys. Rin is so cute! I absolutely love this plushie of him! He's so snazzy with his cool and unique black outfit, and slick grayish magenta hair, with all its intricate swoops and spikes. I love the mischievous smirk on his face (just like he looks on the tag), and his bright, bubbly magenta eyes. The quality of the plush is top-notch, and it is very detailed, which is to be expected from all Great Eastern plushies. I was happy to be able to select this Rin plushie on my own to pick out the best one with the nicest shape and softest stuffing, rather than order one online from a random seller and take a chance that the plush might be slightly misshapen or too firmly stuffed.  This Rin plush is nice and squishy-soft, great for cuddling and hugging. I was surprised at how soft he was, especially in the tummy -- I've been hugging and squishing him since I got him. I just love the squishy softness! (In comparison, my Rei plush was so firmly stuffed for some reason that I thought all of the "Free!" GE Animation plushies were made this way.) Rin's head is stuffed a bit firmer than his body and it is rather large and sort of chibi-ish, but it is perfectly round in shape, and is not oddly elongated or misshapen; so the stitch on his chin is not obvious at all.  Anyhow, I'm VERY pleased with this Rin plushie! Definitely one of my new favourites, and he goes well with my Rei. So snazzy, well-made, and cute! :)
Funny looking Bing bong. Love it
A great buy!  Large and adorable.  It has the yellow tag from the movie on it.
Big Plankton  Just to be clear, this Plankton is 10.5 inches. Get out a ruler, he's big, for Plankton.
Little sister loves it  My little sister is a big Naruto fan and uses this as her actual wallet she's had It since January and still uses
Madeline Doll  The doll was a Christmas gift for a small child (girl) and I'm  sure she will like it. The soft body should make it easy to play with.
Great  Shipped fast and absolultey as expected. Great deal
Photo not accurate.  It looks a little different from the photo but its pretty nice.
Really, really cute. What else could you want?
Just as we hoped  This skully is the perfect size. Soft and cute.
9 year old daughter and my niece 18 months love this so much  My 9 months, 9 year old daughter and my niece 18 months love this so much.  I ordered 3, only wish to have more design for girls.  It feels super soft and cuddling.
Soft and Cuddly  This snowman is perfect for a lovie for a baby. My 9 month old son loves to just hold him while he goes on a car or stroller ride. I haven't had to put him in the washer machine yet, but he seems really durable. And he is REALLY soft!
awesome  my girlfriend love this doll and she uses it to sleep with. She added it to her other plushy collection.
So very cute  I always saw this cute dog in my facebook account, I didn't know that I could buy the plush toy but I couldn't resist when I saw it here. It's so cute that I'm thinking in buying one more.
It is small but the kids love playing super Mario with it  I got this for only $1.99 ! It is small but the kids love playing super Mario with it!
Great!
Huge  This thing is huge. It is very soft. It is made very well. They did not use cheap material. My daughter loves it
small maltese  My puppy really loves this.....
Love it  My son loved it!!! It is bigger than we imagine it. Very fluffy and good material. I use one on my car and my son had one on hanging on his backpack.
bunnelby plush toy  All expectations were met
Kids love these!  Loved these! We bought them to hand out on Halloween. We were a big hit! Super cute too.
cute
Soft and cuddly elephant  Cute size another soft cuddly toy for my grandson.  He is lately loving elephants.
Adorable doll  My 2 year old son steals his baby sister's cabbage patch doll so I wanted to get him something of his own. There aren't many options for "boy" looking dolls. This one looked like it would work for him. It's cute, it is just the right size for a toddler to carry and being completely plush I don't have to worry about him hitting someone with it. He will probably get bored with it in a year or two so the low price makes it even better. He likes it and gave it a hug when he opened it on his birthday.
Poppy  Bought this for my 2 year old and she loves it and all it's cute sayings!
very cute  I was surprised at how big they are. The color is vivid. Very cute.
i love it great plush  great batman plush :) i ordered it to do dirty things too :) in my bathroom , bent over wearing cat ears, up de ass yes and in the shower,,,yum ()()
Angry Birds Star Wars 8" Plush - Luke  This item was for my grandson who collects Angry Birds. He loves the Star Wars birds and really enjoyed getting this particular one. I highly recommend it for any child that loves Angry Birds
REALLY COOL!  So, Ive been working on a fnaf plush series and this will be in there, so I will take a pic when it arrives
so I decided to get her Molly as well since it's her favorite character from the show  I got this for my toddler as a gift and she loves it! She's a huge Bubble Guppies fan and already has a Bubble Puppy plush that my sister got her, so I decided to get her Molly as well since it's her favorite character from the show. She loves this little plush and sleeps with it every night. She also plays with it during the day and has a blast. Very cute and fun little plush for toddlers.
The photos do not do this dashing hero justice...  Superior Quality!!  Even better than expected.  I ordered Eugene and the 19" Rapunzel for our 19 month old daughter for Christmas.  She loves "Punzel" and watches "Tangles"  at least once a day.  She is too young to play with the Barbie style dolls.  These plush dolls are super soft and perfect for little bodies to snuggle and cuddle.  Plus, there are no tiny accessories to pose a choking hazard.  I am very pleased with the purchase and can't wait for our daughter to see these Christmas morning!
love it
I wish it was a real dog.  Tim Burton, anything else to say?
Cute & cuddly  Girlfriend loved it and it fit with the theme of her shop. She love alligators-they are her spirit animal-sit on her display case
Kid was stoked to get it  Fairly large, but definitely cute. It doesn't really do anything though. Has little handles on it's hands and feet for your kit to put theirs in and stretch it out.
This little guy is adorable. Authentic Trolls item with tag  This little guy is adorable.  Authentic Trolls item with tag.  My grandson loves him.  He arrived much cuter than I thought he would.  Highly recommend for children that loves Trolls.
... said he was going to be but still a good item just be more informative about the correct  A little bit smaller than it said he was going to be but still a good item just be more informative about the correct sizing
Lovable doll!  Love this doll! Very very cute! Can't wait for my daughter to open her up for Christmas!  Seems very well made.  Very soft and lovable.
Very small but cute
Saving for Christmas!  Bought this to give to my grandson for Christmas. Can't wait till he sees it, he'll love it. Was a nice size and well made.
Exactly as described  Amazing exactly as shown it shows its greyish in the picture and it's grayish in real life too!
Singing Barney  I was very please to find this singing Barney for my little 3 year old granddaughter. She was so excited when she opened this Christmas gift. Barney and Friends is her favorite show. She hugged Barney and hugged me too.
Awesome!  Bought this for a friends child along with Elmo and he loves them both.  I would definitely recommend this toy.
Tiiiiiingle!  Arrived on time, in perfect condition. I've been needing Tingle for my Legend of Zelda collection. I love him. Would definitely buy again.
Second one I bought for my son. He loves it!
In Running for "Toy of the Year"!  The second I plucked this little Elmo from the Amazon box, I knew he was something special. Not only is he ridiculously adorable, but the animatronics only enhance his charm. His "fur" is super soft and will withstand some very gentle spot-cleaning (we tried just a whisper of Woolite on a damp cloth ... there was no bleeding, but we were SUPER careful). Now, at first I was dismayed by his very hard, coffee-can like torso ... it is such a massive contrast to the rest of his tactile self. But, I can see why it might be necessary, so it was quickly forgotten (well, pretty much).  Each hat has its own mode ... and "no hat" will still activate play.  Now, I find obnoxiously loud toys abhorrent (and have committed all sorts of acts of sabotage to make them quieter ... ask me about the glory that is Super Glue). (LeapFrog toys are a huge offender! They make me nuts!) Though Elmo is "loud," for some reason I have yet to find him grating. And, it goes without saying that I located the on/off area before relinquishing him to tiny hands. (Potential loss of sanity averted!!)  Really young ones will love, love, love this adorable guy. (Like others, I can envision this becoming the "big" Christmas toy for this year).
Adorable & feels great  Adorable and Feels great. I know my grandchild will love it and want to pet it.
Excellent very pleased
Came fast no problems
Musical Barney  Wow! This is just great. It is hard to find these toys anymore. This was a great experience all around. This toy gets a 5 star rating from me. It is wonderful and again, my niece is going to enjoy it alot.
more beautiful and fluffy than pictured  this papillon almost looks like a real one. i love this lil guy, even tho i was very pleased at the actual size of it. much bigger than i was expecting. i thought it was the size of a webkinz or a beanie babie but its almost twice that. i was very pleased.
loved it
Great for a Mario Kart lover  These were a hit at Christmas. Great for a Mario Kart lover.
plush  My son has been collecting minecraft plush with his holiday and birthday money. I love how soft these are. This one is one of my personal favorites lol. He carries his collection everywhere. We received it in a timely manner as well.
Adorable!

A treasure  This one I really, really wanted and I'm very happy to have this.  This is my most favorite Muppet.
Exactly what I was looking for!
and he loved it. He plays very rough with it  I gave my 6 year old son the koopa troopa for christmas, and he loved it.  He plays very rough with it, and it has held up very well after almost 4 months.  I've put it in the washer, and it's still in great shape.
Perfect!
This is the best birthday present ever.  I love Cleffa because she's very soft and cuddly.
Soft and cuddly, my baby neice loves it.
Great quality work  My son absolutely loves his beagle!  Great quality work, durable and so soft.
Loveable and impressive  I received this product in order to write a review using my honest opinions.  My youngest daughter is 19m and adores stuffed animals and baby dolls.  Cora is cute and cuddly, but still has many features to help my daughter learn.  I have been truly impress with just how much Cora the Smart Cub knows!  We have had similar products, but Cora has so many more advanced features.  After setting her up she not only calls my daughter by name, but also plays her favorite songs and knew that Halloween was coming up!  She amazes me with her phrases and keeps my toddler engaged!  My four year old is also impressed with Cora and loves to play with her.
He loved it!
just adorable ^w^
Good quality dinosaur snuggler.  Cute Brachiosaurus. Good quality. Perfect for a little dinosaur lover.
<33  Smaller than expected, but its the perfect size. He's soft and easy to store.
Great  Cute plush toy. Great service
These were great quality. My kids thought they were the actual elves from the Santa video this year. AMAZING quality for the price!
If you love Courage, you gotta have this!
Great product for dry skin  I love this stuff because my skin is dry.  It is hard to find it in retail stores so was happy to find it on Amazon.  It is just like a conditioner for your hair but for your skin instead.
Very cute!
My son likes playing with is doll.
My daughter loves it
" I really like the pokemon that my grandma gave me  My granddaughter, Maddie, says,  " I really like the pokemon that my grandma gave me.  I like the pockets.  I can put coins in them.  She is very mobile.  I like to put her on the floor and roll her around.  She is the favorite pokemon that I have."
Great!
Just wonderful little toy dog. Thanks ks
Awesome
Have used this product for many years  This is a great moisturizer, which has been part of my daily routine for many many years...at least 7-8.  In the morning, I wash my face, then use this moisturizer.  It goes on pretty cleanly, doesn't feel greasy, easy to use pump, not overly expensive, spf 15.  Does the job well.
Engaging Toy  A hit straight out of the bag! Two-year-old nephew loves this toy, and so does his sister who is two years older. Perfect to tote in the car and while sitting in a shopping basket, too!
cute toy.
Don't take his brain!  :D  So cute! I bought this for my mom, who loves zombies. It's perfect for occupational therapy, too! A fun exercise for the hands and arms.
Love love love it  Love love love it, Fennekin is my favorite starter and being able to add this to my small colection was awesome.
Fun tou
Bed buddy  I don't care if 17 is too old to buy plushies but ever since my friend gave me Pokemon white and I obtained Blitzle (Zeus) I fell in love with the pokemon. When I saw this I HAD to have it. I keep him on my bed with my Umbreon! It's so soft and I love the feel of it's lether-like stripes and hooves. You get exactly what's in the picture.
good
My 3yr old loves it
Perfect fit!  I had an old wooden cradle that was my granddads, my dads, then mine and now for the new baby. I needed a new waterproof mattress for it and this fit perfectly! Great product.
She loves it!  Best girl friend is opsesed with him she now has 2 one for each arm very well made and looks just like the caritor the pic does not do justice!
Our two year old grandchild loves them  This was a great buy. The dolls were just the right size for a 2 1/2 year old to play with. They don't have doll hair but instead have cloth hair, so there is no hair for a preschooler to mess up. She loves them.
My niece received it for Christmas.  My niece loves her furby, she takes it with her every where she goes, it is like a friend. It was delivered as promised and looks Great.
So soft!  My boy loves his "Melmo"!
soft and cute  The stuffed Skitty is very soft and cute. My 5 year old son loved receiving this as a gift. Very cute.
Very pleased with this as a gift for a friend, she was ecstatic about it! :)
Good for presentations about Lyme Disease  Used this for presentation on Lyme Disease. Served its purpose.
GREAT ITEM GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND FAST SHIPPING MY SON ENJOYS PLAYING WITH THIS ITEM :)  GREAT ITEM GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND FAST SHIPPING MY SON ENJOYS PLAYING WITH THIS ITEM :)
just what was wanted!
It's Blooper  It's smaller than I expected, honestly.  My kid loves it though.  Soft, plush and perfect for a Super Mario collector.
I bought this for my 1 year old granddaughter who loves buckles. She loves the toy and keeps it close by in her toy area.
perfection  It arrived 2 weeks early. It is the cutest and softest and fluffiest and cuddliest thing I have ever seen, felt, cuddled. I love it. I bought it for my friend but I want one for myself now. It's a little over a foot big, super soft, nice quality.
Very cute and just the right size
my son like it 
Perfect first Elmo for a 20-month old who loves Elmo  Perfect size plush without any stiff/plastic parts, and great for the price.  I have passed over so many options in the stores because the price was too high or the Elmo included hard plastic eyes.
Very cute and nice quality.
So adorable and very soft! Very nice quality.
great buy.  Well made, great buy.
Great item!!  Awsome! Kid loves it! Very happy!
Bought it for an 18 mo old I babysit and she absolutely loves it!! Takes it everywhere with her and hugs it just randomly!! She loves to swap up the colors too!
Love it! My little boy has one  Love it! My little boy has one, and this is what I get for birthday presents for 1 and 2 year olds. My son started taking interest in buckles at 18 months. Love this toy!
My nephew got this for Christmas and loved it!
Great for kids or dogs  Even though I am not much of a Plants VS Zombies fan, I love this bundle. My pit bull loves to play with stuffed animals. I ordered this lot for her. Almost all of the stuffed animals don't have hard eyes and noses. They make great dogs toys! I love seeing my dog so happy! I received the stuffed animals in exchange for my honest review.
wife loves it.
So. . . .so CUTE!!  My two year old grandson is CRAZY for "neigh neighs" (horses). . . .and he LOVES watching Toy Story. . . .so this was a must have purchase.  He takes it to bed EVERY night!!  Quality material/construction . . . I think it will last for quite awhile.
Great toy for my grandaughter.  Keeps her active and she loves it!
This stuffed animal was everything I expected it to be and more .  My grandson loves it.
Student loved it.
Perfect  Great size fo a toddler. I mashine wash it in a delicates bag.
Soft sturdy fabric!  Got this for my grandson.  He loved the movie.  So cute!
Good shipment  It seems to be made well, and won't break so easily. Fast shipment. Everything went smooth
It is so cute!
Pete the cat with buttons  Perfect gift for our grandchildren!  A great size to read with.  It is so cute and snuggly too!  They love it!
My son is turning 4 and obsessed with Rudolph so thought this would be the perfect gift! I was worried as the reviews said some people received the music note on the foot and some received a version that said "my first Christmas". I called the manufacturer and they said the music note version should be the one sold because the sku #s matched up - they were right. We got the music note one - so excited to give to my son!
Wonderful toy  Amazingly soft, cuddly toy for a 4-year old girl who is fascinated by unicorns.  My grandaughter loves it to sleep with.
Replaced a similar doll my granddaughter had and she loved it!
Very cute!
Really nice, great for cons or dorms...  OK, so the color is totally off, but the thing is adorable - well, as adorable as a chest-burster can be. There's even another set of "teeth" deep in the mouth. There's a wire "spine" in about 2/3rds of the plushie so you can pose or wrap around your neck....
Absolutely adorable.  I did not open the plastic bag as this was purchased for a charity, so I hope there were no flaws.  Arrived nice and fluffy, not flattened.
So cute! Very one of a kind.
A definite winner with our kids  This lovable fellow was a must have for our Super Mario Bros plushy collection; This particular plushy was a favorite as it complemented Toad; It was interesting to see how plushies = 'male action figures'. I was seeking plushies that were not menacing looking and were adequately sized, and this definitely was a winner in our home. With twins, we find that that these lovable dolls help the imagination grow..!
Great price. Worth the wait. Be patient.  It took a long time to arrive but it was the exact product and in great shape. Thank you.

ADORABLE and loved by the kids!  Cloud is a-freaking-dorable! I am a therapist and he has helped my little clients talk about their feelings. He is well loved by boys as well as girls. I imagine Cloud would be equally at home with play therapy or CBT, as well as other modalities, as he can be very useful in facilitating psychoed about feelings, feeling identification, labeling, communication, etc. Kids immediately gravitate towards him with his unusual but cute and cuddly looks, and start putting feelings in his pouch. I have Bug too, which, with his folding wings, is great to talk about anxiety and bravery, but kids tend to gravitate towards Cloud more, with his neutral looks, his rotating head, and happy/sad faces. If you work with kids and are trying to pick a Kimochi to try first, I would start with Cloud.  In terms of his "personality", his rotating head and story make him the more "moody one", whose mood can change in a heartbeat, but you can really customize that to the situation at hand. A well loved buddy, both by the young ones and myself. I can't wait to get all the other Kimochis and feeling sets! The only catch is one of my clients did write on a custom feeling, but I haven't tried washing it off yet so I don't know how reusable those are. However, the pen did make a mess when it was used.  UPDATE 4/6/16: Over 5 years later, Cloud is doing great. He still looks great and quite clean, despite having helped many children by now. I am very glad I got Cloud. I imagine he will be a part of my work for many years to come.
She loved it!  She loved it!
My son loved this!
Excellent
Good
Great toy, just not for cuddling.  Looks stunning and well made. Good attention to the details and is instantly recognizable as the character from the books.  Due note that it's not the most cuddly toy as it has cardboard stiffeners in it to help it hold its shape.
very cute and perfect
Seems well made and makes my kid happy.  Can't beat it. Plushie Ender Dragon to rule all the other Minecraft critters in my kid's room. Seems well made and makes my kid happy.
A Must Buy!  Beautiful and very detailed its a  must have for any naruto fan.
this is a good buy. I look forward to buying more.
Our 3 year old wanted a "GIANT" Elmo for her bday. I wanted to go bigger...but felt this was big enough to call GIANT (and didn't want to pay $100 for a stuffed animal). This is a manageable enough size that we don't need an extra car seat for it for when it travels.
Our grandson loves it:)
Awesome received on time for Christmas great job my grandchild loves it
looks just like picture-great quality-good size and delivered fast
Just adorable and delivered on time!!
Prince Elmo has arrived!  We tend to be all about Disney in our household so I was excited for my 2 year old daughter to receive a toy that's not Disney. When we opened the box she was immediately excited. She's familiar with Elmo, but doesn't watch Sesame Street all the time so I was amazed when she yelled "ELMO! HI, ELMO!!". That really goes to show what an impact the show makes even with a child who maybe watches sesame street 2-3 times a month. Ok, back to the toy. Once I figured out how to take it out of demo mode, we started having a blast. With her just turning 2, i do have to help her switch the hats because they are kind of hard to lock into place but nothing a kid 6 months older would have trouble with. We loved playing all the games and listening to Elmo. Her favorite(despite my best efforts to get her to change it up) is Prince Elmo. At first it was just chaos making Elmo talk, but now she actually sits and listens to what Elmo is asking her to do. She's learning to follow instructions and listen closely. We love this toy and would highly recommend it to other families. We can't wait to have her cousins over to play!  We received Let's Imagine Elmo free from Playskool to Review through BzzAgent
My daughter's favorite!  My 13-month-old daughter received loads of stuffed animals before and during her first year, and though we tried, she took no interest in any of them. Then, we took away her pacifier at 13 months, snuck this guy, along with three other stuffed animals, into her crib, and she immediately gravitated toward this adorable wolf, whom we call Wolfie. The two are now inseparable. She'll frequently take Wolfie for rides in her stroller, her toddler car and her carseat, and she loves to grab onto his crunchy legs or tail.  I thought this was really adorable when we received it as a gift, but now, I know it's much more than that. It's a happy little part of our daughter's life (and ours).
I love the size of this calendar  I love the size of this calendar.  I have room to write daily planning activities.  Includes nice space in back for phone #'s, etc.  Have been using for many years now.

My daughter loved  Cute! My daughter loved it
Perfect! my 3 year old loved it.
Good quality, super cute and comfortable, love the big ears!
Exactly what I was looking for.  This scale is easy to clean, use, store and was relatively inexpensive. I am on Weight Watchers and this scale has made the annoying task of measuring everything I eat relatively painless. I am very happy with my purchase.
My Little Ulqui  I love this doll.  The details are amazing as is the amount of time it took to ship.  This is a great piece to add to anyone's Ulquiorra collection.
cute  My baby loves it!
Adorable!  ADORABLE!  So cute, gosh that cookie monster why is he so cute and funny!  My Grandson loved it.
need a laugh?  These work!
It arrived in perfect condition too  I bought these for my son's party last week, they're Incredible!  I just wanted to keep all of them! You should sell bags filled with the same emoji... that way everyone gets the same... It arrived in perfect condition too.
Beautiful Boo  Boo looks great!  So soft, yet nice and sturdy body. It was packaged well.  This was a gift that was a big hit.
Awesome  So awesome it took 4 days to arive and was so cool this will be great for my cosplay

... Poo and Piglet from Santa but I know my Great grandson loved him  Tigger was added to Poo and Piglet from Santa but I know my Great grandson loved him.
Endless entertainment  Bought this to keep my 20-mo old busy on an 8+ hour flight since she has taken a recent interest to buckles. This was a huge hit and provided endless entertainment through the entire vacation. We now keep it in the car for a distraction. Love it.
nehpew loved it
Nice toy  Thank you, in time. good quality as all little thinkers. Nice character -  now it is easy to explain to children why this theory is utopian today
GET THEM  They are a good size, SO SOFT, and high quality. This is am amazing deal.
why hello kitty!  super cute and mint, daughter loves it! would buy from seller again
Very nice product.
We bought three of it to stock up  My 21 month old baby boy LOVES it!! I bought one for him when he was about 5-6 month old (when he already knows how to turn his head and body over. ), and he loves it since... I put this lullaby toy next to him, the lullaby and the glow light helps my boy falls asleep within five minutes! I don't know if it works this well on every baby, but I believe this lullaby toy can soothe babies...at least, make babies feel they are not alone in the cribs.  The only thing I want to complain is the glow light function is down after about one year of use. My boy doesn't really care if it lights up now if he is tired, but maybe some babies will love the light everytime when they sleep.  We bought 2 more for backup (actually my boy is using three of them...)
Granddaughter loves this doll.
very nice product, as advertised  Can't complaint....very nice product, as advertised... I would buy again  without hesitation A++++
small but adorable!  Love these little Boos! We have Birthday Boo and Bumblebee Boo. My 2 year old just loves them. They are very small but perfect for little hands. I think the small size is part of the reason my daughter loves them so much. I'm sure we will end up with more of these!
This was exactly how they discribed it and it arrived on time.
Good item for the price
Great for soup and a sandwich!  LOVE these paper plates. They're larger, and oval. They're the perfect size for a bowl of soup and a sandwich! So, great for this time of year. They hold wet food wonderfully and hold up in a microwave. We use these at work, where we can't use real dishes. So, they're wonderful!
Good seller and product.
This is adorable. I really like it  This is adorable. I really like it. Came as it looked. I'd recommend it. However I don't see the circle thing but it did come with the stuffed toy and card. Nothing is broken or fell a part. I give it a 5.
Item as described and arrived early.
Pretty fabulous!  I love my plush, it's a little smaller then when I order the Applejack one but it's still cute
Best Moogle plush I've seen yet  This thing is fantastic.  It's absolutely adorable and made with high quality materials.  It's a really good size, too.  It's very huggable without being excessively bulky and taking up a ton of space.  I got this for a friend of mine and she absolutely loves it.  I'm definitely getting one for myself.
Really nice quality and made of incredibly soft plush fur  Such a cute plush! Really nice quality and made of incredibly soft plush fur. I've wanted one of these for years and now I finally have my own little luck dragon! :D

he gets very happy and is so proud of his accomplishment  My 17 month old spends time daily trying to figure this out and every time he gets a buckle in place, he gets very happy and is so proud of his accomplishment. A great toy!
The paw patrol plush pals are great. My 4 year old grand daughter loves them.

Bing Bong is the favorite for my granddaughter  My granddaughter loves snuggling with Bing Bong! It is a very cute stuffed animal and looks just like him!
This "Hot potato plush chicken" has been so much fun with all the age groups in our extended family  This "Hot potato plush chicken" has been so much fun with all the age groups in our extended family. Simple rules that even the three year olds can join in and have fun. Our children, their spouses,grandchildren, and friends, have had a lot of fun playing. The only down side is that the battery case is sensitive and when bumped will turn off but we have learned to adjust, press the chicken's foot and continue.
Her parents don't love the noise though  Bought this for my 2.5 year old goddaughter. She loves this toy so much! Her parents don't love the noise though.
Mickey Mouse  My son loves this Mickey.  He is 6 years old and sleeps with it every night.  The Mickey comes up to about his chest level if standing it on the ground.  From the top of the ear to the bottom of the foot is about 27" tall.  My son said it feels like he is sleeping with someone (which helps him feel safe because the Mickey is the size of a small child.
So ugly, they are cute!  My boys love these dolls.  Even though they are called "Ugly," they are really soft, cute and cuddly!  I would recommend these to anyone, especially boys!
No complaints  My 15 month old is obsessed with buckles (car seat, high chair, stroller, etc).  He loves this you.  My 4 year old likes it as well, though he likes anything of interest to my little one.
awesome grreat size
Awesome cheap and durable
So cute!
Loved it!
Awesome toy  My 2 year old loved this when I gave it to her. Keeps her busy and she buckles the toy over and over again. Happy with my purchase!
This product was perfect just what I expected when it arrived  This product was perfect just what I expected when it arrived. The only thing was that I was suppose to get free shipping with my order but was charged any way. Thank You.
My granddaughter loved it. for Christmas.
Wow
Awesome toy!  My 2 year old loves buckles. She would spend so much time buckling my 2 month olds car seat & monkey bouncer. I got her this buckle toy & she loves it. The buckles are really easy to buckle & unbuckle. They are great for little hands. Also very colorful & educational because of the colors & numbers. Great toy. So happy I found it.
Great learning toy  Great learning toy! My 1 1/2 year old loves this. It not only teaches him how to snap different buckles but also how to match ones colors! Great toy keeps him busy for a little while which is good for him!
Great job

Woody take note!  Sounds just like the real one in my backyard.
Worth it  The quality of this plush doll is really good, it was a gift for a friend and she loves it.
So Cute  I bought this for my husband for the anniversary of 6 years of being together. He loves Domo, and he loved this one. I love how cheap it was and how quickly it shipped!
Cute and cuddly!  Very well constructed and detailed, my favorite parts are his little ears and his grumpy face! He is large enough for lots of rhino adventures with kids and seems very well made. If you are a rhino lover like me you will love this plush!
Wrestling stuffed toy and sleeping buddie.  My grandson loved it and slept with it for a long time.
great  Christmas present for my son.  He loves it
A Super Toy!  I bought this for my son's 2nd birthday because he loves all things Superman.  It's about a foot tall, and comfy to sleep with (he takes it to bed with him every night) and also machine-washable, just make sure to air dry!  The only complaint about durability is that the painted-on hair is easily chewed off... but that's only a problem if your kid eats everything like mine does! lol  A great toy!
my daughter uses him and Sulley to guard her door at night from the bad monsters. Worth every penny  Quality is very high; my daughter uses him and Sulley to guard her door at night from the bad monsters.  Worth every penny!
Nice gift for someone  So cute! This fawn is small but very soft. A sweet gift for a little one.
Soft and cuddly mike!  We love mike wozowski!
As Advertised  This toy is one of the best toothless toys on the market. It is plush and the wings function as described. Great for toothless fans!
Exactly what i expected!
My Son Loves Elmo!!!!  I don't know where all the negative reviews are coming from, but my son is in love with ELMO KNOWS YOUR NAME! I am so excited. I even told my co-worker and supervisor and they both got one! All of us agree that this toy is a must for any family, whether you like Pooh or Elmo. My son's face lights up when Elmo says his name, and sings the Alphabet, etc. He looks at my mouth because he thinks I must be saying all of these things. When I sing along, he realizes its ELMO!!!! What a great new toy to enjoy for generations. This will be a classic, like the Cabbage Patch Kids!
Super cute
BB8  Cute and cuddly
Cute.  My daughter had this same doll and lost it months ago. I was very happy to have found the same cute, well made, TY doll to put in her stocking.
As Expected  Came in as Discribed and fits well witht the other Mario plush figure. Will be excalent for my girl to keep up with my boy.
My 2 year old great grandson really loves it-thanks for making his Christmas special  My 2 year old great grandson really loves it-thanks for making his Christmas special.   Hes playing with it right now!  
MY WIFE LOVED IT
An adorable little plush toy, that makes me smile whenever I see it!
so i was pretty bummed out  I got this plush and after i bought i realized that in the picture of the plush, it showed the hair sown on backward. so i was pretty bummed out, but when i got it, its hair was the right way and it was well worth the money spent!
Great Quality  This product came very fast, in 2 days to be exact, the same time as an Amazon prime shipment that I ordered on the same day.  The quality is great, Kirito's outfit is made of good material and the sword is actually rubber near the handle which was a nice surprise.  Overall, a  great buy for any SAO lover, haters stay away.  I would recommend buying him with the Asuna plush that they also sell as the two arrive in the same packaging if you do, so you save on shipping.
Nice plush for the kids  Cute toy and very soft. My son loves it. It doesn't talk, but makes video game sounds. The hands are stitched to the body, so you'll have to cut a few threads if you want the arms to be movable. That's not a big deal though.
looks good this was a gift
Hallmark is amazing!  Want to start off by saying Hallmark  customer service is amazing. I didn't receive mines from Usps. And Hallmark fed ex me another one ASAP. Im so happy thank you so much and its the cutest thing.!!!
The faces look a little off but our 3 year old still loves them just the same
simple nice little toy for my son, he loves it, is exactly the one on the picture.
its beautifull!!!
quiet time  This toy is wonderful for quiet play when you may not be able to interact with your little one. i.e. doctors office, church
Fun gift for someone with a sense of humor  I bought this for my Mother-in-Law who I'd currently battling breast cancer. It's a great size and seems to be well made. It's a nice light-hearted gift for someone with a great sense of humor and positive outlook. She loved it.
Perfect for 4 year old granddaughter  My 4 year old granddaughter loves this so it is a hit!
Soul  ok this plushie was a gift for my wife she's the best i know alot about collectibles so i got her a soul plushie because she likes anime i have a great eye for noticing stuff im usually pickey about things when i get them but this plushie was well made stitched & got here in amazing condition great work amazingly soft fabric & cuddly to boot the only down side is that the face wasn't embroidered on it was........i guess u can say painted on but non the less for you anime fans a great buy.
Such a cute plush doll.  My 1 year old loves it, I think it has to do with her big eyes :)
love  bought for christmas..love it

Love the Vamplets products
ziggy  Ziggy is just too cute
Granddaughter loved this item
Hetalia Plush - England  My anime freak LOVES this plush doll!  Wish there was more of a selection of these plushes in the USA.  Anime is Japanese based cartoons and some of them have language/actions that would not be appropriate for younger children.  Be proactive and know what your child is watching on the internet--this is how we were introduced to Hetalia. These are a bit pricey, but worth it for your child who understands the anime characters and love them.  We have all three plushes that are available in the Hetalia series.  They are well constructed and have not come apart at the seams.  Perfect size--not too big or small.  Would recommend for older kids.
Great Quality  Just as pictured and the real thing! Thanks!
Got this for my son for Christmas.  He loves it.  Seems to be holding up well.
Dear Ugly Deer  Dear Deer is a large, 14-inch classic Ugly Doll with open arms and adorable fingers. Exceptional for hugging whether you want to give hugs or grab some hugs for yourself.
Stuffed animal  This is a very awesome plush doll! We had it for 2 years and no rips or stains the tags where also very easy to cut of f
Sylveon is adorable.
Doctor Zomboss  Son uses it for a movie prop.

Nice plush  Big and high quality. This is pretty well made. It had no strange odor when it arrived. It's lovely.
My youngest son loves it!!!!  It's bigger than he is, but he absolutely loves his HUGE Bubble Puppy!!! :) Awesome shipping! And awesome price! I'm fully satisfied with this order!

A+
Wonderful doll  This is a super sweet doll.  We bought it for our 6 month old as her first doll.  We did not pay what these dolls retail for usually.  We found this doll in the Amazon Warehouse for a steal.  If I paid the original retail price, I would definitely want to gift this to an older child.
Pooh-yah  Our grandson loved it at first sight!
LOVE THE LORAX!  If only he was bigger! So so cute! My granddaughter loves him! I will buy the other characters of these Dr Zuess stuffed toys!
My son loved it!
