Got it for my Grandson and he loves it!!
Was a birthday gift
Granddaughter Loved it!  This little doll is so soft and sweet and nothing can come off of it.  My granddaughter is just 15 months old and she loved her doll. I also love that she can just go in the washer and dryer, with babies they want to kiss on everything they have and after awhile the toys need a good cleaning so this works out great.  I would recommend this to anyone with a small child who needs something really cute and soft to love.
geat toy  We love this toy. I wish you could buy them right as you come out of the movie. What is wrong with you Disney?
Just what the recipient wanted!  Just what the recipient wanted!  Got this as a gift for a relative and they love it.  It is more substantive and slightly larger than expected, which was nice.
Just as described  My four year old son loves it!  One of the only things he wanted for Christmas and he was quite happy with it :)
Pretty sure Dorothy is her new bestfriend  Just got delivered about 20 minutes ago and my daughters face lit up when she saw it. Pretty sure Dorothy is her new bestfriend. Thank you!!!!
Whale of a tail  Great toys for toddlers who love to buckle their highchairs, strollers ext.

Exactly what I expected.  My grandson loves it!
High Quality & Very Adorable!  This little Charmander plushie is very adorable! He looks exactly like he does in the picture, and the quality is just amazing! Great buy in my opinion (:
Purchased the toy for my great-granddaughter.  She was thrilled with it.
kids love them. Perfect size  Cute, kids love them. Perfect size .
Super Barney!!!  Loved by all.  My granddaughter loves him and carries him everywhere.  Just the right size and she loves the fact that he sings just to her.
very realistic our dog attacked and claimed as it's own
First friend  Perfect size for my 14 month old grand child and sooo soft. He takes it everywhere and snuggles with Elmo every night.  Elmo is his first friend.
Perfect for a 2 year old.  Just the right size to carry around.
:)
Chibi Soul  Cute, and Adorable. Fun to have, great gift a recommend buy.
Love it.  Would deff reccommend to those mommys of bubble guppie lovers like my daughter. she was so excited when she got bubble puppie that i just had to get molly , and whats molly without gill? ;) love it. do wish it was a bit bigger though since you can almost get them the same thing but cheaper at walmart. but i cant really complain. my little girl loves it. so , i do too!  On a side note , deena and una should NOT be that expensive , how am i suppose to have the whole set if deena is $50 alone.. not gonna happen.
Great for Zelda fans  Looks exactly as pictured.
This is a much loved stuffed animal in our home  Very cute and durable pig with sewn eyes.  No need to worry about a dog or baby choking on them.  This is a much loved stuffed animal in our home.
Awesome
Good conversation starter!  It's a little red doughnut!  This is a great office mascot for my desk as we look for blood on items, and the reaction to indicate the presence of blood is catalyzed by red blood cells.
Excellent!  Purchased this for a contest giveaway, but it was a big hit with my own kids and their friends.  I'll have to get at least one more!
Troll Buddy  My daughter absolutely loved this gift for Christmas.  She sleeps with it every night and carries it around everywhere.  I recommend this to ever child that loves trolls.
Not for too young but perfect for kids  Got this little guy for my little brother. I got the light blue T. rex and I couldn't be happier with it. Great quality and perfect for young kids. Has beans in the bottom so he sits upright so watch out for young kids chewing on his feet, the beads could be bad.
Quality, organic and affordable!  Gorgeous toy, as most products from Apple Park are <3
This is a wonderful stuff animal.  I am very please with it.
Great toy!  This thing is awesome! The wires in the front legs and neck are such a great idea. We can bend him to do whatever, share snacks, watch his movie, etc. I've read about them not straightening out exactly straight again- ours does a pretty good job. It's like bending a coat hanger.. It's not going to be perfect but at the end of the day it's a kid's toy. And he doesn't notice. He's happy, I'm happy.
Cute and Fuzzy Moogle  Super cute and soft. Came with official tags and no damage. The pom pom doesn't really hold up on its own even though it is reinforced a little by a rubbery/plastic tube but it is not flimsy, the ball is just heavy.  If you are thinking of getting this for a child I would not recommend it; I do not think it would hold up well to regular play, but it can handle light playing, hugs or a tumble off the shelf and be fine. The warnings on the tag say it is not machine washable and also suggest you not "lick or bite the product, as this may cause the colours to fade." The light pink patches on the cheeks and ears appear to be lightly painted/air brushed on and will likely fade if it gets wet so you cannot smooch it too much. The wings are a more leathery material and are not fuzzy like the rest of the Moogle and have traditional bat-like ribbing.  It makes a great addition to a Final Fantasy collection and is great for anyone familiar with the games. I hope my additional details can get another Moogle adopted today!
Great product
Love this toy, my granddaughter 6mos  but Elmo still gets her attention
Great value. My daughter loves this Poliwhirl  Great value.  My daughter loves this Poliwhirl.
My Daughter Thinks it is Great!!!!
It was 100% perfect!!  This was the very last item to complete a costume.  It was 100% perfect!!
My Favorite Star Wars Toy  I was very pleasantly surprised when I opened the box--this C-3PO is really beautiful to behold. One of the nicest Star Wars toys I have seen. I am so glad I got it for my little nephew who is now discovering Star Wars just like his father did when he was a young boy. Super Speedy Delivery too. I just ordered my 2nd one from this vendor.
Great little buddy!  This was purchased for my 4 year old Grandson to be pal for Sully that had been purchased earlier from another retailer.  He is very soft and just the right size to be Sully's little buddy.
it is so cute and cool at the same time.
Super cute!  This stuffed animal is super cute and super well made! Very nice cuddle size too, especially for a little kid. Still nice for adult me though.
hours of fun....
5 stars  Perfect & great price! My 2 year old is going to be so excited on Christmas!!
Cute and well made a bit pricey but worth it to see the smiles!
Adorable ballerina mouse  Adorable ballerina mouse. My 4 yo daughter loves it!  She has named it "Bubble", which is just perfect for this little mouse.
This is awesome!  My granddaughter saw this doll and that was all she talked about. I am saving it for a christmas present. I know she will be thrilled when she sees it.
My daughter loves it.  Its soft and cute.  She sleeps with him Every night
This movie gets a lot of hate, but I loved it  This movie gets a lot of hate, but I loved it, and this plush is adorable. Bought it as kind of an inside joke/house warming gift. Wish I could have found a bigger one, but this was kind of cute, being so small.
Bubble Guppies Nonny  The bubble guppies were impossible to buy in stores and was so happy to find them on amazon.  They are a great size and are made extremely well.  I bought this two years ago along with three others and it still looks just as good as it did when it was given as a gift.  They are a perfect size.
good stuff.
Looks nice in the window  This suncatcher hangs in my kitchen window with another Joan Baker Design.  Very happy with it.
