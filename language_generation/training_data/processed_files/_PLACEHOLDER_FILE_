This directory should contain the JSON-files with all reviews for each of the five categories:
 - laptops.json
 - cell_phones.json
 - mens_running_shoes.json
 - vacuums.json
 - plush_figures.json

Each file has to contain a list of dictionaries where each dict is a review and has an attribute "text" containing the reviews text content.
