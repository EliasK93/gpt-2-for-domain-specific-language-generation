Wouldnt buy it again. I did research and read reviews. But, doesnt do well on hardwood floors. Stays wet, and leaves streaks.
I bought this one and it worked great for a few months  Everyone told me to get a Dyson.  I bought this one and it worked great for a few months.  Now it is broken....  Apparently they are not as reliable as people say they are.  I tried to see if I could return it through Amazon and since its been over 30 days I cant return it.
Do not buy . I WANT MY MONEY BACK  Do not buy this product . Was not double boxed . Also does not work . It fakes like it is sucking up dust .. But all the dust just releases in the back .. Into a pile on the floor . This is my 2nd time using it ... I purchase it and used it 3 weeks after !! Bad product I want my money back
Very disappointed  I have been a loyal Hoover customer for a long time. I bought this because I have a lot of attachments that I like. I found out that none of them fit this one. Why isn't there an adapter for the difference?  The hose that this has won't stay together. It doesn't do edges. I would be happier if i could buy a super long hose like i had for my tempo. You have lost me as a Hoover customer.
4 months old and I am getting shock really hard in the handle....I want this replaced.
Broken filter. Poor quality  When we tried to clean the dust first time, we saw that the filter is broken.
Sorry but I hate my Dyson  So I know there are a lot of you Dyson lovers out there but to tell the truth, I wish I had spent $500 getting my 20 year old Miracle MAte refurbished. Here are my complaints. I have the DC Animal canister with turbine head, I HATE the turbine head, what a stupid idea. It works when it feels like working, if you suck up anything bigger that a little scrap of paper it jams, and if the canister  (I'll get to that) is even 1/2 full the turbine head doesn't work. Hair will NOT just suck up but it twists around the turbine head an dyou MUST pull it apart almost every time you use it. The Canister is WAY too small. I have to clean it out everytime I vacuum and it is REALLY hard to clean. It's very narrow, and you can't even get your hand in with a paper towel to clean it out. And it must get cleaned out or it gets goopy and gross. The canister is full of grooves on the outside and is always covered in dust and crap. As for being for animal hair, yes, it sucks it up BUT at ball joint on the turbine head, the hair can escape and the joint on the outside is always covered in dog hair so you have to vacuum the VACUUM!!!! I am a regular person with dogs and kids in and out of my house all day. This particular vacuum creates more work for me.
Died WAY too soon!!!! :( :( :(  Bought in December 2016 and it has already lost 80 percent of its suction. I am highly dissapointed in a 4 month lifespan. I only have one dog and cat (neither are extreme shedding breeds) and I've cleaned the vacuum after each use. There is no way this should be happening. $100 down the drain unless the seller decides to help after reading this rating. That's my last hope. :(
I rarely write reviews, but this vacuum cleaner is simply the worst household appliance I've ever owned and I feel an obligation to warn others. I thought it was a pretty safe bet when I ordered it (I mistakenly thought that there was a certain baseline level of quality for Kenmore products and vacuum cleaners in general), but I have had it for several years and it has performed poorly and been frustrating to use and maintain from the start. It's strangely awkward and poorly designed. Very little about it is intuitive so I have to look things up frequently to figure out the simplest tasks. The suction is poor and I have to hold it at a certain angle just to clean the one rug I own - a flat kilim. Amazingly, I've had several parts simply fall off of it during the most basic usage and I can't figure out how to reattach them or what they were for in the first place. When I open the main compartment to change the bag, the hinge does not close easily and I have to ask my more mechanically inclined spouse for help. When I try to buy new bags or filters, it's confusing what parts to buy because buying directly from Kenmore is incredibly over-priced compared to Amazon. I'll just be making do with it for a few more years until I can justify buying a new vacuum cleaner.
ELECTROLUX in "NAME ONLY"  VERY Disappointed with performance which was understandable after finding out that this has the Electrolux name BUT IS NOT a true Electrolux vacuum.  The original Electrolux products now are under the name AERUS so don't be fooled with this product.  The price was great - BUT - we got what we paid for.  Performance was bad - could barely get it pushed across a large rug/carpet.  Thought it picked up a lot of dirt because the bagless cannister was full BUT found out otherwise after vacuuming with an original Electrolux upright.  Also found that after emptying cannister there is not a convenient way to get all the fine dust out of the bagless cannister.  We ended up getting rid of it within one month and got the real Electrolux - LUX GUARDIAN by AERUS. So please don't make the same mistake we did and waste money on this -&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Electrolux-Nimble-EL8602A-Upright-Vacuum-Cleaner/dp/B0058OIGUY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Electrolux Nimble EL8602A Upright Vacuum Cleaner</a>.
Take "Pet" Out of the Title!  I have two cats in a small apartment.  The litter box is in my ceramic tile bathroom, and I have dark cherry hardwood floors.  I thought this vacuum would be perfect for my needs.  It is not great at all.  It blows the cat litter back at your feet, and spins fur balls in the air like a tornado without ever grabbing them.  It works on my rug, and that is it!  The attachments don't have much suction, and the "pet paw" attachment stops rotating when you use it on upholstery.  It is not at all what I expected.  Because shipping stuff back is a hastle, and I threw the box away I am stuck with it for awhile.  I suppose you get what you pay for.  Spend more, and get something else.
It's ineffective on grout  If you are looking for a machine to clean grout, this is not the one for you. I purchased the Hoover Floor Mate Deluxe especially to clean grout and it was very ineffective. Secondly it didn't clean the tile floor any better than a mop with vinegar and water, or a Mr. Clean mixture. Unfortunately, I will be returning the machine to Amazon.
Vacuum update 1 yr later: Stopped working  I've only had this vacuum for a couple of days. The price is right and shipping was free. It was easy to assemble and I tested it right away. The suction is very good, but I think it's a little loud. It's not that heavy, but it does have mostly plastic parts. The suction tube in particular is very cheaply made. I have a small apartment, so this should be fine for my space. I purchased the 3-year floor care protection plan just in case...it was only $4.99 for items below $50. NOTE: Exactly 1 year later and the vacuum no longer works. Good thing I bought the Square Trade protection plan. I will get a full refund.
DEFECTIVE product  This main rug cacuuming part of this product stopped working about a month after I purchased it. This is a faulty product. I was pretty much robbed.
Extendable wand Does not stay in place... Not happy  Not so great/ The wand that is adjustable DOES NOT STAY WHERE YOU PUT IT. So it just makes me mad every time I use it. Not happy but it is in Panama the country and to expensive to send back. Not happy at all.
Wasted Money  The only good thing about this machine is that is does pick up dirt nicely. However, it must have been made of the cheapest materials and labor. All of the switches are difficult to use, the foot prop to disengage the push handle from the floor part  takes two or three taps of the foot before it finally disengage,  and  the switch at the top for turning the self-propelled mechanism will not work without a struggle. I have to jiggle the handle to get it to move. The self propelled system is so jerky that i feel like I'm walking a rowdy dog. The switches on the bottom for carpet/floor are extremely hard to adjust.  I should have known when it arrived it with a big hole in the side as though someone had taken a bat and ran it through, that it was going to be a dud. If it weren't for the large amount of money to ship this thing back, I would have sent it back the first day. Its just a painful experience to use the thing. Think twice or three times about buying this item.
Way to HEAVY  I purchased this unit after reading the great reviews even though some did mention how heavy this unit was. After trying it out I realized there was no way I could push this around without damaging all of my base boards in my house. I sent it back. Thanks Amazon for your great return process.
I would love to get my money back on it  A very disappointing product. I would love to get my money back on it. As other 2 star commenters, the bristles barely touch the tile and certainly do not get into the grout lines. The machine did pick up loose dirt after the floor was mopped with a Swiffer, but dirt can be plainly seen where a rug had been placed over the floor. I would not recommend this product for floor cleaning, especially in heavy traffic areas.
Are you kidding me?  SO I always wanted a Dyson because of the hype of course. Never in a million years did I ever EVER expect this vacuum cleaner would be a cheap piece of crap. It is flimsy and crackles when it turns. I swear to god I expect it to break within a month. Nothing is going to last that is made this shotty. I imagine at one time perhaps Dysons were built better probably when they were building their brand but this thing basically looks goes together,empties and vacuums like the $50 Hoover it replaced. I just can not believe this company has the GAUL to have this priced at $500. Now I got a couple hundred off for Cyber Monday however, Even at $300 I still feel ripped off. I can not express enough the creakiness and what I would expect Dyson would claim is its lightweight characteristic, is really just a use of a bunch of cheap thin light weight plastic. I will fill out the warranty card because f you don't I have heard Dyson will not honor the warranty. And I know I JUST know I will end up making a warranty claim. REDICULOUS and beyond hype. It is brainwashing because even with all this I Still give it two stars. SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME!!!!  Don't be a total queen like me and think your going to be grand. Se I figured that out. RICH PEOPLE don't show off their vacuums to each other. So chances are your not going to get to inspect it a your high faluting neighbors house. Had I seen one in person NO WAY I WOULD HAVE WASTED $300, $500 I woulda jumped off the roof by now.
Short Life  I have had two of these units die on me within six months. The first - original - purchase within 4 months of purchase and the second within two months of being replaced by Hoover.  They both died the same way. Put them away and when i attempted to reuse therm the next week, pushed the switch and the unit popped, motor didn't come on,  and smelled burnt electric. I think the pump froze while the unit sat in the closet and the motor shorted when it could not turn the vacuum pump. This is a shame because I love how well this machine picked up dirt off my -all hard floor - house. It's like a lover that  you fell for head over heels and then found out that  'lover' just could not stay up after you have developed a fetish for the way it sucks dirt.
It was great but the motor finally died  I had an earlier version for about 30 years.  It was great but the motor finally died.  This newer version stinks.  The hose is terrible.  EVERY TIME I use it, the hose bends so that it won't work and makes a horribly annoying noise at the same time.  I spend more time un-bending the hose than vacuuming.  Also, it's supposed to be portable but if you remove one of the attachments that sits inside the handle, the handle is too hot to hold.  It makes me wonder if anyone ever tested this product before putting it on the market. Very frustrating. Why fix something if it's not broken? --> The older version was fine just as it was.
Used for a year, went to clean it, completely broken.  Okay, do NOT attempt to try and take the bottom off to clean it. I just did it and it literally breaks the entire vacuum. Im kind of OCD about keepin vacuums clean and there is noooo way to access the bottom of this vacuum other than one tiny access hole on the back. Whoopsies!  Other than that, its been a great vacuum for the past year that Ive owned it.
Unhappy with this purchase  I was very unhappy with this purchase.  The product arrived in poor condition.  It was not factory packed.  It was partially assembled , appeared to have been a returned product and then resold to me.  there was an item missing from the box. The first time I tried using the item, It would not disperse the water.  Very dissappointing purchase.  I returned the item and did receive a full credit in a very timely manner.  I will repurchase from a local store and try again.  Will not order from amazon.
Not as promised  I've had this for nearly 1 year and I cannot recommend it. Difficult to fully empty dirt cup, clogs easily  (I've had to unclog it several times). My carpets didn't seem clean, well they weren't.  Although I vacuum regularly and it did pull a lot of pet hair from the carpet I vacuumed then shampooed and the carpet shampooed pulled a significant amount of hair out. The pet hair upholstery cleaner jams up too.  I'm going to give this one away and get something better
DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME  Don't waste your time or money on this product. The motor died after a month and a half of me having it. I used it a total of 4 TIMES! Now I gotta invest in ANOTHER Vacuum cleaner.
Not as good as my last Bissell,disappointed.
Piece of junk!  Piece of junk! The old AS1000 was the best model. This one does not have suction and the belt does not spin the brush!
Soo bad...
This is JUNK - you have been warned.  Junk.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  I purchased it in November 2017 because of a leak I experienced in my first floor living room ceiling.  After the clean up was handled by an external company, life intruded and I wasn't able to use the product until this weekend.  It puts down water, scrubs, but doesn't suck up the water.  I had to get paper towels to mop up the dirty water on my kitchen floor.  I am soo glad I did not try it on my hardwood floors first. Not worth the money.
this vacuum sucks!  I have had it with this vacuum!! I have had it for a year and every time I vacuum I have to take it a part and remove clogs from it and this morning while I was vacuuming the darn thig got cloged again and while removing the clog from the hose the darn hose riped right off the part that connects it to the base. It over it's going to the dump tonight. And now I have to buy a new vacuum and wait two weeks for it to be delivered.
DON'T BUY DYSON -- THEY DON'T STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS  Don't buy Dyson.  The vacuum never worked.  Dyson has given me the run-around for 6 months to get it fixed, and it is still broken.  Dyson does not stand behind its products.  DO NOT BUY DYSON.  THE WORST SERVICE OF ANY COMPANY.
Always breaking.  I have had this vacuum for less than 6 months and have already had it break two times. The cordless feature is great but it is no use to me if it doesn't work. Spend your money elsewhere.  UPDATE: We're now on our SECOND replacement vacuum (third vacuum) due to how unreliable the hoover air is. The vacuum just stops working. We've tried replacement batteries and double check the entire unit. Poorly made!
This vacuum will eventually lose suction, too.  UPDATE: 6 months later, I had to replace this vacuum too.  It lost all suction. It's a shame because it worked so well at first as you can see from my previous review below.  PREVIOUS REVIEW: For some reason I have to purchase new vacuums just about every year due to them losing their suction.  Perhaps it's because I vacuum everyday.  It really doesn't matter how much I spend on a vacuum or whether it has the "new cyclone technology" or not, but I was searching and reading reviews and I came across this one.  For the price, and the pretty good reviews, I took a chance and purchased this item.....I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!  People weren't kidding when they said that this vacuum really sucks! LOL  I love that it's bagless with a Hepa Filter (which is great for getting microbes out of the air as well).  It's light weight, also, which is great because I'm 8 months prego :) WHAT A WONDERFUL LITTLE VACUUM CLEANER.  I just hope this one lasts a little more than a year...we'll see.  GOOD LUCK!
EXPENSIVE, LABORIOUS & UNDERWHELMING FLOOR CLEANER  There was a review on here I really should have listened to. The review mentioned that it takes repeated passes to get a simple spot clean. I didn't realize how any passes it would take. I had regular milk and juice spots (small round spots) on our tile floor. This machine took at least 7-8 passes to remove it. A mop would have taken 1-2 max. This left me wondering "if it take 7-8 passes to clean a milk spot, how do I know it's cleaning the rest ok?"  It was such a long and laborious process to clean with this machine that I simply packed it up and returned it. Something must have been wrong with my machine (and that other reviewers).  And yes, all instructions were read and followed carefully.  One more thing, the grout wasn't getting cleaned with the Tile and Grout bottle they sell separately. Grout wasn't impacted in any way.
short in the wiring  this is my 3rd one over the years and probably my last being the roller brush has a short in the wiring or something because it just stops off and on during a 10 min vac job, and i'm sure down the road the short hose connected to the roller unit will split like the other 2. I took the box it was shipped in to the trash already otherwise this unit would have went right back the next afternoon
Defective Product, but Good Customer Service  I was so tired of disposable vacuums, I decided to purchase a commercial grade.  From all of the reviews this one looked to be the best in cost comparison. I wanted a bag vacuum because it is easier to change than the bag-less for me. However after putting the vacuum together, the motor would not spin the brush. My husband is very mechanically inclined and checked every piece/ part and still could not get it to spin. Thank the lord we saved the box. We returned without any issues. The customer service was very prompt/ excellent. I would recommend the company but not the product.
Do not buy. It is over rated big time. How it got so many positive results is beyond me. One wheel broke off in transportation. DO NOT BUY!
Herky jerky when vacuuming
It was too heavy for me.
Five Stars  great product if u have a dog but to bad  that it broke after 3 months !!!!! and the return is until 30 days !! so is not worth it
This is one of the worst purchases I've made in years  This is one of the worst purchases I've made in years. It broke within the first few uses, and after getting it fixed, broke again, and now, only after a little over a year of owning it, broke again for a third time (each break has been a different problem). I feel duped after having spent so much on a defective appliance.
2nd shark that didn't last  Stopped working within 6 months
... an older Featherlight Dirt Devil Vacuum that is much better than the one I just bought  I have an older Featherlight Dirt Devil Vacuum that is much better than the one I just bought. The suction isn't as good as the older one. They are making these much cheaper. Buy a better vacuum cleaner than this one.
Maybe a lemon, you tell me  I have had my F7425-900 for a year+ and have had the rotor replaced because it rusted, the spin brushes replaced because the plastic pin snapped, the detachable handle on the dispenser detached when it wasn't supposed to, now I need a new dispenser since it hit the basement floor and cracked.  Now that I have fixed most of those items the water spray will not stop spraying!  I have not been rough with this machine. I am thoroughly dissapointed with the craftsmanship of this machine. So much so, that I am afraid to buy another Hoover.
Worked good first few times now it doesn't  Worked good first few times now it doesn't. It spreads the hairs all over the floor and spits dirt out and woll only work with the wand out don't waste your money
Like the canister setup  This vacuum breaks down after 2/3months. I now have had 2 replacements. Like the canister setup. But the circuit  boards no good. Company will replace it no refunds back or up grade. Also warranty is not upgraded for new one.
First 60 days were great but..........  Bought it in May 2003 to use on hardwood floors and on occasion, oriental rugs.  Worked great out of the box.  Its lightweight, adjustable, and convenient. Two weeks ago, the on/off switch started to not consistently work.  This week, dead...I couldn't recommend buying this product based on my experience unless you want to gamble...  It is a great design, but very poorly executed.
FAILED Before A Year Was Up!  Wouldn't even last a year! When it worked, I LOVED it, but the attachments have not worked for over a month and now the vacuum part is starting to fail too! It is too bad because I loved this one so much more than any of the other brands and types I've owned!
Only good for hard surfaces  This item is only good for hard floors. Would not even roll on my rugs, a little and pick anything up
This is the worst vacuum I have ever used  I bought this vacuum as a Christmas gift to myself to replace a small vacuum I used to clean my car.  This vacuum has zero suction and did not even pick up even noticeable particles on my carpet.  The brush head did not move and I had to drag it around to make the brush rotate.  I might have just gotten a defective one but at $200 on clearance I am not very happy.  I now have to pay for shipping to return the darn thing.
