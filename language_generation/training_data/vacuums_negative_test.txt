Wouldnt buy it again. I did research and read reviews. But, doesnt do well on hardwood floors. Stays wet, and leaves streaks.
I bought this one and it worked great for a few months  Everyone told me to get a Dyson.  I bought this one and it worked great for a few months.  Now it is broken....  Apparently they are not as reliable as people say they are.  I tried to see if I could return it through Amazon and since its been over 30 days I cant return it.
Do not buy . I WANT MY MONEY BACK  Do not buy this product . Was not double boxed . Also does not work . It fakes like it is sucking up dust .. But all the dust just releases in the back .. Into a pile on the floor . This is my 2nd time using it ... I purchase it and used it 3 weeks after !! Bad product I want my money back
Very disappointed  I have been a loyal Hoover customer for a long time. I bought this because I have a lot of attachments that I like. I found out that none of them fit this one. Why isn't there an adapter for the difference?  The hose that this has won't stay together. It doesn't do edges. I would be happier if i could buy a super long hose like i had for my tempo. You have lost me as a Hoover customer.
4 months old and I am getting shock really hard in the handle....I want this replaced.
Broken filter. Poor quality  When we tried to clean the dust first time, we saw that the filter is broken.
Sorry but I hate my Dyson  So I know there are a lot of you Dyson lovers out there but to tell the truth, I wish I had spent $500 getting my 20 year old Miracle MAte refurbished. Here are my complaints. I have the DC Animal canister with turbine head, I HATE the turbine head, what a stupid idea. It works when it feels like working, if you suck up anything bigger that a little scrap of paper it jams, and if the canister  (I'll get to that) is even 1/2 full the turbine head doesn't work. Hair will NOT just suck up but it twists around the turbine head an dyou MUST pull it apart almost every time you use it. The Canister is WAY too small. I have to clean it out everytime I vacuum and it is REALLY hard to clean. It's very narrow, and you can't even get your hand in with a paper towel to clean it out. And it must get cleaned out or it gets goopy and gross. The canister is full of grooves on the outside and is always covered in dust and crap. As for being for animal hair, yes, it sucks it up BUT at ball joint on the turbine head, the hair can escape and the joint on the outside is always covered in dog hair so you have to vacuum the VACUUM!!!! I am a regular person with dogs and kids in and out of my house all day. This particular vacuum creates more work for me.
Died WAY too soon!!!! :( :( :(  Bought in December 2016 and it has already lost 80 percent of its suction. I am highly dissapointed in a 4 month lifespan. I only have one dog and cat (neither are extreme shedding breeds) and I've cleaned the vacuum after each use. There is no way this should be happening. $100 down the drain unless the seller decides to help after reading this rating. That's my last hope. :(
I rarely write reviews, but this vacuum cleaner is simply the worst household appliance I've ever owned and I feel an obligation to warn others. I thought it was a pretty safe bet when I ordered it (I mistakenly thought that there was a certain baseline level of quality for Kenmore products and vacuum cleaners in general), but I have had it for several years and it has performed poorly and been frustrating to use and maintain from the start. It's strangely awkward and poorly designed. Very little about it is intuitive so I have to look things up frequently to figure out the simplest tasks. The suction is poor and I have to hold it at a certain angle just to clean the one rug I own - a flat kilim. Amazingly, I've had several parts simply fall off of it during the most basic usage and I can't figure out how to reattach them or what they were for in the first place. When I open the main compartment to change the bag, the hinge does not close easily and I have to ask my more mechanically inclined spouse for help. When I try to buy new bags or filters, it's confusing what parts to buy because buying directly from Kenmore is incredibly over-priced compared to Amazon. I'll just be making do with it for a few more years until I can justify buying a new vacuum cleaner.
ELECTROLUX in "NAME ONLY"  VERY Disappointed with performance which was understandable after finding out that this has the Electrolux name BUT IS NOT a true Electrolux vacuum.  The original Electrolux products now are under the name AERUS so don't be fooled with this product.  The price was great - BUT - we got what we paid for.  Performance was bad - could barely get it pushed across a large rug/carpet.  Thought it picked up a lot of dirt because the bagless cannister was full BUT found out otherwise after vacuuming with an original Electrolux upright.  Also found that after emptying cannister there is not a convenient way to get all the fine dust out of the bagless cannister.  We ended up getting rid of it within one month and got the real Electrolux - LUX GUARDIAN by AERUS. So please don't make the same mistake we did and waste money on this -&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Electrolux-Nimble-EL8602A-Upright-Vacuum-Cleaner/dp/B0058OIGUY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Electrolux Nimble EL8602A Upright Vacuum Cleaner</a>.
Take "Pet" Out of the Title!  I have two cats in a small apartment.  The litter box is in my ceramic tile bathroom, and I have dark cherry hardwood floors.  I thought this vacuum would be perfect for my needs.  It is not great at all.  It blows the cat litter back at your feet, and spins fur balls in the air like a tornado without ever grabbing them.  It works on my rug, and that is it!  The attachments don't have much suction, and the "pet paw" attachment stops rotating when you use it on upholstery.  It is not at all what I expected.  Because shipping stuff back is a hastle, and I threw the box away I am stuck with it for awhile.  I suppose you get what you pay for.  Spend more, and get something else.
It's ineffective on grout  If you are looking for a machine to clean grout, this is not the one for you. I purchased the Hoover Floor Mate Deluxe especially to clean grout and it was very ineffective. Secondly it didn't clean the tile floor any better than a mop with vinegar and water, or a Mr. Clean mixture. Unfortunately, I will be returning the machine to Amazon.
Vacuum update 1 yr later: Stopped working  I've only had this vacuum for a couple of days. The price is right and shipping was free. It was easy to assemble and I tested it right away. The suction is very good, but I think it's a little loud. It's not that heavy, but it does have mostly plastic parts. The suction tube in particular is very cheaply made. I have a small apartment, so this should be fine for my space. I purchased the 3-year floor care protection plan just in case...it was only $4.99 for items below $50. NOTE: Exactly 1 year later and the vacuum no longer works. Good thing I bought the Square Trade protection plan. I will get a full refund.
DEFECTIVE product  This main rug cacuuming part of this product stopped working about a month after I purchased it. This is a faulty product. I was pretty much robbed.
Extendable wand Does not stay in place... Not happy  Not so great/ The wand that is adjustable DOES NOT STAY WHERE YOU PUT IT. So it just makes me mad every time I use it. Not happy but it is in Panama the country and to expensive to send back. Not happy at all.
Wasted Money  The only good thing about this machine is that is does pick up dirt nicely. However, it must have been made of the cheapest materials and labor. All of the switches are difficult to use, the foot prop to disengage the push handle from the floor part  takes two or three taps of the foot before it finally disengage,  and  the switch at the top for turning the self-propelled mechanism will not work without a struggle. I have to jiggle the handle to get it to move. The self propelled system is so jerky that i feel like I'm walking a rowdy dog. The switches on the bottom for carpet/floor are extremely hard to adjust.  I should have known when it arrived it with a big hole in the side as though someone had taken a bat and ran it through, that it was going to be a dud. If it weren't for the large amount of money to ship this thing back, I would have sent it back the first day. Its just a painful experience to use the thing. Think twice or three times about buying this item.
Way to HEAVY  I purchased this unit after reading the great reviews even though some did mention how heavy this unit was. After trying it out I realized there was no way I could push this around without damaging all of my base boards in my house. I sent it back. Thanks Amazon for your great return process.
I would love to get my money back on it  A very disappointing product. I would love to get my money back on it. As other 2 star commenters, the bristles barely touch the tile and certainly do not get into the grout lines. The machine did pick up loose dirt after the floor was mopped with a Swiffer, but dirt can be plainly seen where a rug had been placed over the floor. I would not recommend this product for floor cleaning, especially in heavy traffic areas.
Are you kidding me?  SO I always wanted a Dyson because of the hype of course. Never in a million years did I ever EVER expect this vacuum cleaner would be a cheap piece of crap. It is flimsy and crackles when it turns. I swear to god I expect it to break within a month. Nothing is going to last that is made this shotty. I imagine at one time perhaps Dysons were built better probably when they were building their brand but this thing basically looks goes together,empties and vacuums like the $50 Hoover it replaced. I just can not believe this company has the GAUL to have this priced at $500. Now I got a couple hundred off for Cyber Monday however, Even at $300 I still feel ripped off. I can not express enough the creakiness and what I would expect Dyson would claim is its lightweight characteristic, is really just a use of a bunch of cheap thin light weight plastic. I will fill out the warranty card because f you don't I have heard Dyson will not honor the warranty. And I know I JUST know I will end up making a warranty claim. REDICULOUS and beyond hype. It is brainwashing because even with all this I Still give it two stars. SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME!!!!  Don't be a total queen like me and think your going to be grand. Se I figured that out. RICH PEOPLE don't show off their vacuums to each other. So chances are your not going to get to inspect it a your high faluting neighbors house. Had I seen one in person NO WAY I WOULD HAVE WASTED $300, $500 I woulda jumped off the roof by now.
Short Life  I have had two of these units die on me within six months. The first - original - purchase within 4 months of purchase and the second within two months of being replaced by Hoover.  They both died the same way. Put them away and when i attempted to reuse therm the next week, pushed the switch and the unit popped, motor didn't come on,  and smelled burnt electric. I think the pump froze while the unit sat in the closet and the motor shorted when it could not turn the vacuum pump. This is a shame because I love how well this machine picked up dirt off my -all hard floor - house. It's like a lover that  you fell for head over heels and then found out that  'lover' just could not stay up after you have developed a fetish for the way it sucks dirt.
It was great but the motor finally died  I had an earlier version for about 30 years.  It was great but the motor finally died.  This newer version stinks.  The hose is terrible.  EVERY TIME I use it, the hose bends so that it won't work and makes a horribly annoying noise at the same time.  I spend more time un-bending the hose than vacuuming.  Also, it's supposed to be portable but if you remove one of the attachments that sits inside the handle, the handle is too hot to hold.  It makes me wonder if anyone ever tested this product before putting it on the market. Very frustrating. Why fix something if it's not broken? --> The older version was fine just as it was.
Used for a year, went to clean it, completely broken.  Okay, do NOT attempt to try and take the bottom off to clean it. I just did it and it literally breaks the entire vacuum. Im kind of OCD about keepin vacuums clean and there is noooo way to access the bottom of this vacuum other than one tiny access hole on the back. Whoopsies!  Other than that, its been a great vacuum for the past year that Ive owned it.
Unhappy with this purchase  I was very unhappy with this purchase.  The product arrived in poor condition.  It was not factory packed.  It was partially assembled , appeared to have been a returned product and then resold to me.  there was an item missing from the box. The first time I tried using the item, It would not disperse the water.  Very dissappointing purchase.  I returned the item and did receive a full credit in a very timely manner.  I will repurchase from a local store and try again.  Will not order from amazon.
Not as promised  I've had this for nearly 1 year and I cannot recommend it. Difficult to fully empty dirt cup, clogs easily  (I've had to unclog it several times). My carpets didn't seem clean, well they weren't.  Although I vacuum regularly and it did pull a lot of pet hair from the carpet I vacuumed then shampooed and the carpet shampooed pulled a significant amount of hair out. The pet hair upholstery cleaner jams up too.  I'm going to give this one away and get something better
DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME  Don't waste your time or money on this product. The motor died after a month and a half of me having it. I used it a total of 4 TIMES! Now I gotta invest in ANOTHER Vacuum cleaner.
Not as good as my last Bissell,disappointed.
Piece of junk!  Piece of junk! The old AS1000 was the best model. This one does not have suction and the belt does not spin the brush!
Soo bad...
This is JUNK - you have been warned.  Junk.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  I purchased it in November 2017 because of a leak I experienced in my first floor living room ceiling.  After the clean up was handled by an external company, life intruded and I wasn't able to use the product until this weekend.  It puts down water, scrubs, but doesn't suck up the water.  I had to get paper towels to mop up the dirty water on my kitchen floor.  I am soo glad I did not try it on my hardwood floors first. Not worth the money.
this vacuum sucks!  I have had it with this vacuum!! I have had it for a year and every time I vacuum I have to take it a part and remove clogs from it and this morning while I was vacuuming the darn thig got cloged again and while removing the clog from the hose the darn hose riped right off the part that connects it to the base. It over it's going to the dump tonight. And now I have to buy a new vacuum and wait two weeks for it to be delivered.
DON'T BUY DYSON -- THEY DON'T STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS  Don't buy Dyson.  The vacuum never worked.  Dyson has given me the run-around for 6 months to get it fixed, and it is still broken.  Dyson does not stand behind its products.  DO NOT BUY DYSON.  THE WORST SERVICE OF ANY COMPANY.
Always breaking.  I have had this vacuum for less than 6 months and have already had it break two times. The cordless feature is great but it is no use to me if it doesn't work. Spend your money elsewhere.  UPDATE: We're now on our SECOND replacement vacuum (third vacuum) due to how unreliable the hoover air is. The vacuum just stops working. We've tried replacement batteries and double check the entire unit. Poorly made!
This vacuum will eventually lose suction, too.  UPDATE: 6 months later, I had to replace this vacuum too.  It lost all suction. It's a shame because it worked so well at first as you can see from my previous review below.  PREVIOUS REVIEW: For some reason I have to purchase new vacuums just about every year due to them losing their suction.  Perhaps it's because I vacuum everyday.  It really doesn't matter how much I spend on a vacuum or whether it has the "new cyclone technology" or not, but I was searching and reading reviews and I came across this one.  For the price, and the pretty good reviews, I took a chance and purchased this item.....I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!  People weren't kidding when they said that this vacuum really sucks! LOL  I love that it's bagless with a Hepa Filter (which is great for getting microbes out of the air as well).  It's light weight, also, which is great because I'm 8 months prego :) WHAT A WONDERFUL LITTLE VACUUM CLEANER.  I just hope this one lasts a little more than a year...we'll see.  GOOD LUCK!
EXPENSIVE, LABORIOUS & UNDERWHELMING FLOOR CLEANER  There was a review on here I really should have listened to. The review mentioned that it takes repeated passes to get a simple spot clean. I didn't realize how any passes it would take. I had regular milk and juice spots (small round spots) on our tile floor. This machine took at least 7-8 passes to remove it. A mop would have taken 1-2 max. This left me wondering "if it take 7-8 passes to clean a milk spot, how do I know it's cleaning the rest ok?"  It was such a long and laborious process to clean with this machine that I simply packed it up and returned it. Something must have been wrong with my machine (and that other reviewers).  And yes, all instructions were read and followed carefully.  One more thing, the grout wasn't getting cleaned with the Tile and Grout bottle they sell separately. Grout wasn't impacted in any way.
short in the wiring  this is my 3rd one over the years and probably my last being the roller brush has a short in the wiring or something because it just stops off and on during a 10 min vac job, and i'm sure down the road the short hose connected to the roller unit will split like the other 2. I took the box it was shipped in to the trash already otherwise this unit would have went right back the next afternoon
Defective Product, but Good Customer Service  I was so tired of disposable vacuums, I decided to purchase a commercial grade.  From all of the reviews this one looked to be the best in cost comparison. I wanted a bag vacuum because it is easier to change than the bag-less for me. However after putting the vacuum together, the motor would not spin the brush. My husband is very mechanically inclined and checked every piece/ part and still could not get it to spin. Thank the lord we saved the box. We returned without any issues. The customer service was very prompt/ excellent. I would recommend the company but not the product.
Do not buy. It is over rated big time. How it got so many positive results is beyond me. One wheel broke off in transportation. DO NOT BUY!
Herky jerky when vacuuming
It was too heavy for me.
Five Stars  great product if u have a dog but to bad  that it broke after 3 months !!!!! and the return is until 30 days !! so is not worth it
This is one of the worst purchases I've made in years  This is one of the worst purchases I've made in years. It broke within the first few uses, and after getting it fixed, broke again, and now, only after a little over a year of owning it, broke again for a third time (each break has been a different problem). I feel duped after having spent so much on a defective appliance.
2nd shark that didn't last  Stopped working within 6 months
... an older Featherlight Dirt Devil Vacuum that is much better than the one I just bought  I have an older Featherlight Dirt Devil Vacuum that is much better than the one I just bought. The suction isn't as good as the older one. They are making these much cheaper. Buy a better vacuum cleaner than this one.
Maybe a lemon, you tell me  I have had my F7425-900 for a year+ and have had the rotor replaced because it rusted, the spin brushes replaced because the plastic pin snapped, the detachable handle on the dispenser detached when it wasn't supposed to, now I need a new dispenser since it hit the basement floor and cracked.  Now that I have fixed most of those items the water spray will not stop spraying!  I have not been rough with this machine. I am thoroughly dissapointed with the craftsmanship of this machine. So much so, that I am afraid to buy another Hoover.
Worked good first few times now it doesn't  Worked good first few times now it doesn't. It spreads the hairs all over the floor and spits dirt out and woll only work with the wand out don't waste your money
Like the canister setup  This vacuum breaks down after 2/3months. I now have had 2 replacements. Like the canister setup. But the circuit  boards no good. Company will replace it no refunds back or up grade. Also warranty is not upgraded for new one.
First 60 days were great but..........  Bought it in May 2003 to use on hardwood floors and on occasion, oriental rugs.  Worked great out of the box.  Its lightweight, adjustable, and convenient. Two weeks ago, the on/off switch started to not consistently work.  This week, dead...I couldn't recommend buying this product based on my experience unless you want to gamble...  It is a great design, but very poorly executed.
FAILED Before A Year Was Up!  Wouldn't even last a year! When it worked, I LOVED it, but the attachments have not worked for over a month and now the vacuum part is starting to fail too! It is too bad because I loved this one so much more than any of the other brands and types I've owned!
Only good for hard surfaces  This item is only good for hard floors. Would not even roll on my rugs, a little and pick anything up
This is the worst vacuum I have ever used  I bought this vacuum as a Christmas gift to myself to replace a small vacuum I used to clean my car.  This vacuum has zero suction and did not even pick up even noticeable particles on my carpet.  The brush head did not move and I had to drag it around to make the brush rotate.  I might have just gotten a defective one but at $200 on clearance I am not very happy.  I now have to pay for shipping to return the darn thing.
It no longer sucks up.  It started out okay. It no longer sucks up...a loud sound started too. We've tried everything. i have to go thru ProConnect to help, and it's been over 30 days, so they can't help. Kenmore gives a 1-year warranty, ProConnect doesn't. Wish i would have paid attention. I've had this for 6 months, and i'm disappointed.
Be careful depending on your carpet...  I tried the Dyson Ball multi-floor and sent it back after just a few days.  It does have strong suction, so much so that on my short Karistan patterned/carpet it is a workout just to vacuum one room, much less the second story and stairs of my house.  It did do well on hardwood and the oriental rugs on the first floor.  Having no pets nor kids in the house I realized it didn't warrant dreading every time I had to vacuum the carpet  My experience with service started great  A young lady named Chevonne was very helpful and arranged for return with no charges what so ever.  I was told the small ball might be better but they are both $299 right now and paying the same for a less powerful "lower level" vacuum does not appeal to me.  They also mentioned opening up the head to remove a seal to increase air flow but once done it is permanent and was afraid about voiding the warranty  I decided to just return it but unfortunately the gave me 2 return numbers for UPS one for vacuum and one for tools.  The tools number did not work and it took two days and two calls to Dyson while at the UPS store to enable the return.  One last small complaint..the Vacuum itself was originally back ordered and I was told charges would not hit my AMEX until shipped.  My cc showed the charge 8 days before the unit was shipped and I am being told it may take 14 days to credit my CC.  Just a mild irritation but thought I would mention it
Don't Bother  I got this as a Christmas present and specifically asked for a pet friendly vacuum. My dog has short needle fur and I have long hair. Since having the vacuum here has what I've noticed:  - Power paw stopped spinning after the first several uses. Despite thorough cleaning, I have never been able to get it to work again. - Hose constantly pops out when vacuuming along with power paw and other attachments - Brush roll is constantly clogged - Debris gets caught around the filter - On hardwood, the vacuum seems to spread debris everywhere so then I have to vacuum it up with the hose. It barely seems to pick up anything.  The positive is that it is very light - my old vacuum was heavy as lead.
Not what I expected  Does not handle pet hair like it states. My shop vac works better. Guess I should have gotten a bigger one.
Didn't do the job  We were dissatisfied with how it didn't clean the floor very well, and didn't get into the tile grout at all. Also it was cumbersum and didn't fit into small places in the bathroom. we will probably be returning it.
My second Bissell product and my last!  Bissell does not stand by their products!
Arrived non usable, handle release functionality wasn't tested.  Seems like a great vacuum. It assembled easily without tools. The previous design issues I had read about - the wand and the power switch placement - were addressed in a redesign, because the switch is now on the floor deck. There is also a decent wand included.  The only issue is, the handle does not release so that I can use it. I called the number on the back for assistance, but it is closed on Sunday. I looked to see if it's something I can fix, and I can see the problem - there is a plastic clip on each side, but one is on the wrong side of what it's supposed to be, so this thing is locked in upright position.  I have disassembled it to see if I can reposition it properly, but after 5 screws, I can't see any more to take out, to disassemble it further. So I'm stuck. But it seems like a nice vacuum. I'll change my rating if I get assistance, eventually.  Update: got through to the number on the back of the machine that it says to call for assistance.  My call got disconnected on the first couple attempts, so I recommend giving them your number immediately, for a callback.  They said they want to issue a "Call Tag" for the item, so now I have to look for an email, print out a label, put the screws back but also disassemble it to pack up the vacuum securely (they mentioned that I was responsible for any damage that might occur during shipping), write a description of the problem to include with the unit, and drive it to a Fed Ex drop off location.  They said they would take a look at it and ship me out another one in approximately 7-14 days.  I said "that's a lot of trouble, for a $50 vacuum". They said I could take it up with Amazon, if I wanted to go a different route. I guess I'll just do what they said, and hopefully I'll have a working one in a couple of weeks.
Just pray it never breaks.  Shortly after moving into our home we bought this vacuum, 6 months later, it was almost like the motor just died. Nothing that customer service suggested worked, so they replaced it. A few months later the same exact thing happened. I called and they could do nothing for me. Even though it was still in warranty. I will never buy hoover again because of terrible customer service.
Junk  this has got to be the worse vacuum I've ever bought!  I bought mine a little less than a yr ago, it has already been in the shop three times.  Would NEVER buy another Miele!!  The switch to turn on the beater bar just quits working and it has been repaired, just got it back used it 1 time for a very small room, went to use it the next day won't turn on so it's back to the shop.  think twice before you spend a lot of money on the Miele Vacuum. I have a Dyson that is 8 yrs old and has NEVER had to be repaired!
DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT  Purchased this product 4/22/2012 and quit working 8/25/2012 and unfortunately not able to give it no stars in the rating.  Beater bar power brush no longer turns and light has failed.  Followed trouble shooting intructions in manual; nothing works. Called Hoover at the toll free number listed in packing materials.  Obnoxious customer service person and refused to transfer me to a supervisor when requested. I requested warranty service which he refused to authorize. Repeatedly read me the instructions on how to take the beater bar power brush apart and informed me that their products could fail the same day they were purchased.  Why would I want to purchase a product expected to fail the day of purchase? Please learn from my experience and run away from this product.  By the way, the product was not improperly used and was used to vacuum carpeting and tile flooring in a one person, one small dog household.
terrible vacuum!  this vacuum was great for the first week. After that, the problems began. sometimes it would turn off after 2 minutes of vacuuming, (no, not a dirty filter) sometimes it would not turn off at all (we would have to unplug it to shut it off!) and the attachment wand broke almost immediately. Hoover was also terrible with the customer service (sent me a generic response telling me to clean the filter or take it to a vacuum repair shop!!) so now we are back in the market for a new vacuum barely a year after buying this one. very disappointing!
Handle won't stay clicked in  I really do love this vacuum except now after only owning for a few months the handle (that comes off for tube cleaning, etc) will not stay snapped in. Cant use it, pull it back once and the handle comes off!
Don't bother.....  This really doesn't work very well.  Save your money and buy a better vacuum or buy a broom, it will work better!
Vacuum power only good thing about this machine  This vacuum has excellent power for cleaning. However, the cord winder broke in less then a year and the nub on the hard floor brush that is used to connect it to the wand broke shortly after that.
Great Vac, but get ready to replace the hose in a few months  I purchased this vac on-line in Jan 2009.  It works great!  Good suction, and the pet-hair attachment is a wonderful accessory.  The hose that attaches to the vacuum, however, is a very cheap all-plastic hose and will break down from being bent while vacuuming.  I had to replace the hose six months into the purchase.  Eureka replaced it under warranty, but I am sure I will have to do this again in another few months and will have to pay for the hose this time.  We own an upright Eureka vac cleaner as well.  The hose on that has a steel spiral built into it and will outlast the vac cleaner itself.  But this one has a very cheaply made hose and will cost you money in the long run.
DO NOT BUY THIS!!  This is the worst vacuum ever.  A complete waste of money. Hoover was not helpful at all and I will never buy their products again.  This worked for about 2 weeks before clogging and then breaking completely.  I do not even have high vacuuming needs.  My $260 went out with the trash.  An expensive lesson.
Yet Another Bad Review  I would give this product zero stars, if that were possible.  Like a lot of others who gave this product a review, I would have given it five stars when I first bought it.  I owned an older Hoover cleaner for over 12 years and had no problems with it whatsoever. With two kids and 5 dogs, I used the cleaner to death, was not particularly kind and gentle with it and just loved it. So, when the Dual V came out, I got one. I have had this cleaner for about 3 years and have used it maybe six times.  The first time I used it the clean water tank popped off and went flying. That resulted in a broken handle so that the tank could not be snapped onto the machine. Being a cheap human being, I used a bungee cord to hold it on. I blamed myself for being clumsy and went on with the cleaning.  Fast forward to yesterday. I get out the cleaner, fill it and start cleaning. While refilling the clean water tank, I notice the valve is leaking all over the place. I snap it into place anyway and turn on the machine. It starts up and then stops, never to go again for all I know. I think the motor may be blown. Hoping that the motor is just overheated (I am an incurable optimist) I turn my attention to the water tank, hoping I can stop the hemorrhaging going on there while I wait for the machine to cool down. I check the bottom of the tank and notice the plastic is cracked.  So, now both tanks are history and the machine will not run. According to the Hoover website, the closest repair shop is 30 miles away. Guess what? Time to buy a Bissell Proheat. It has been given much better reviews and it sure can't be worse than the Hoover cleaner!  I don't think that I have ever been this disappointed in a product. I guess I was lucky; my cleaner ran fine for about six uses which, from the sound of it, is pretty good.  I want to say thanks to everybody who took the time to share their experiences and write a review. You really helped me to make up my mind to go with the Bissell. I thought that my experiences with the Hoover cleaner were unusual. Turns out they were not. It's too bad, too, since the Hoover does a great job cleaning.
Vary hard to push.
Worthless  Every time we use this vacuum it clogs and we have to take it apart to get it to "work" again. Not to mention even when it is functioning it misses a lot. We have one short haired dog, don't wear our shoes in the house, so it isn't like we are asking much. I wouldn't waste the money again. We were so excited to get this product, and yet it barely even functions. You'd be better off going and getting a $50 Bissell.
Dont do it !!  Constant problems, waste of money.
Do not buy this or any other hoover vaccum  I've never written a review for any product I purchased before but felt compelled to do so after my experience with this vaccum. I purchased this vaccum first in February of this year and had a positive opinion of Hoover at that time. After using the vaccum only a handful of times, the vaccum stopped working. While trying to figure out what was wrong with it I realized it was an electrical problem with the cord. When you jiggled the cord in a certain direction you could get it to turn on for a few seconds. Despite the fact that the period of time alloted to return this vaccum had passed, Amazon took the vaccum back and I reordered the same vaccum. When I went to use the second vaccum, the metal handle that goes into the carpet sweeper attachement was apparently missing a knob that held the handle into the sweeper and the handle would not stay attached to the sweeper. I again returned the product to Amazon and stupidly gave Hoover another chance and reordered the same vaccum again thinking lightining couldn't strike three times. Well it did. After using the third vaccum for only three months, the metal handle going into the sweeper will not release from the sweeper and is stuck on the sweeper. If one person could get three defective vaccums I can only imagine on a national level how many defective vaccums are being sold. After checking my account on Amazon I saw that the time period for returning the vaccum had gone by and I didn't think Amazon would make another exception so I called Hoover directly. I cannot tell you how disappointed I was with their response. The first customer service rep. I spoke with told me that the best they could do for me would be to fix the machine since I did not buy it directly from them. I told them I didn't want it fixed that I wanted to return it altogether and that I had lost all faith in Hoover after my experience with this product. They then transferred me to another level of customer service where I waited another 15 minutes on hold and had to go through the whole story again. Hoover then told me that if I could get documentation from Amazon of the previously returned vaccums they would see what they could do for me. I then called customer service at Amazon and I can't say enough positive things about Amazon, their customer service and their policies. They immediately told me that despite the fact that it was past the return time frame they would gladly take the product back at no cost to me. Thank you Amazon. Needless to say, I will never buy another Hoover vaccum again and hope others who read this review will feel the same.
DOESNT WORK  DONT WORK
DON'T BUY THIS - AVOID - AVOID - AVOID  11/30/11 Using this vacuum less than one year - now in shop for repair.  On board tools flimsy, bases cracked in two months because they slip off hose end.  There is an "air hole" on tube that when hand tools are placed on, they do not cover this hole, as a result some things vacuumed come shooting out in your face.  After much use, pushing the power head forward is OK but when pulling back the handle disconnects electronically and the vacuum shuts down or keeps running and all handle controls are useless and you have to unplug to turn off.  The powerhead lost its ability to "flex" meaning when I pushed forward, the head came off the floor instead of flexing to stay level to the floor.  There is a piece rattling in that area.  As far a bagless - NEVER AGAIN.  The dirt cup fills up too fast - about one fourth of a bagged vacuum and emptying is a disgusting dirt storm.  I empty in the gargae over a large leaf bag.  Then there is the filter to clean - forever brushing and tapping to clear it of all the dust.  The only plus is that this vacuum does have good suction and my carpets are really clean - I have four cats and lots of fur and endured a flea infestation that this vacuum helped clear. 1/1/12 I have downgraded this item.  Still in shop for repair.  Have been without a vacuum one month.  Called repair shop - Hoover cannot fix this - they are replacing it with a new (I hope new and not remanufactured) one.  Don't know if new one comes with any warranty.  After talking with repair shop they don't even recommend this model saying it is too electronic and it burns out easily.  DON'T BUY THIS ITEM AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!! 4/25/15 - Finally got replacement in March of 2012 - as of October 2014 - vacuum started same problem - getting worse as of this date - can't wait for it to finally "die" and I will buy a new vacuum - NOT THIS BRAND
Don't Waste Your Money  Terrible product.  The suction quit working after 2 weeks.  It was also very noisy, which is something I can deal with, but not when it fails in efficiency.  I should have known better than to buy a cheap vacuum.  It wasn't worth the return policy price so I trashed it.
Unusable due to missing screws. Can I get replacement screws?  The screws that hold the handle in place are missing from the box.
Nozzle accessory not supplied as shown.  This is my second Kenmore canister vac. Reviews were favorable and, yes, goes after dog shed which was heavy. But...but still missing in key areas. Notably plastic clips and latches at key stress points, like their wheels that break off. Also Sears kills you on parts. HEPA filter and others along with agitator and belt replacement will be a pocketbook buster. Moreover, the carpet nozzle shown in the manual is NOT even included. Has to be a trip to Sears parts or store to buy separately. A failed business model. If Sears goes out of business who knows what youll be stuck with for repairs? Something to contemplate. Already have filed complaints with Better Business Bureau for service contract shortcomings with Kenmore water heater.
Hose breaks  Liked the vaccum, broke way too early and no support from GV, would not recommend
Defective Re-conditioned  I just received my dyson dc14 low reach r/c model. I was so excited to vacuum.  But it was broken.  The beater bar would not operate so all it wanted to do was act like I was sweeping on un-carpeted floors.  No beating action.  Amazon has been very good at saying they will send me a replacement, but now I have to wait more and take the vacuum back and it has been a real inconvenience.  I hope that the second one works and works longer than 5 minutes.
Leaks water all over the floor after about 10 minutes  This is a great idea in theory, but it leaks water all over the floor after about 10 minutes of use. It does leak a bit (or rather doesn't suck back up the water) from the beginning, but eventually it just starts leaving the water on the floor causing a serious hazard. It also is super wide so doesn't get into a lot of the places that i'd actually like it to get into... not that I can fault them for that because i knew the dimensions before I purchased it, just a heads up.
Not good on tile  I really wanted to like this vac mop but it didn't work well on my tile floors. I have the porcelain wood look tile and it leaves dirty patches of residue on my floors. Returning immediately. 2 stars for the concept and the vac is good on my floors. I think it would have done better on non tile flooring.
junk, keep shopping.  Hoover makes pure junk,  keep shopping. Maybe Dyson will come up with a solid working cleaner that will last more than one year.  This leaks badly.
ive had it a month and it stopped working
Don't waste your money  Probably my fault for not paying closer attention. No wheels, no slides. You literally have to carry it with a strap. Collection bag smaller than a sandwich bag! Really? On the plus, Amazon is fantastic with returns!
So disappointed.  I ordered this 4 months ago. The first two times I used this on my low pile area rugs and hardwood floors it was great. And that's it.no suction, nothing. I've cleared everything several times and it just doesn't work anymore. Would never recommend this to anyone. Waste of money.
Overheats  Horrible. Used literally 3 times and it continues to overheat and shut down. Was left in package until 3 weeks ago as we were displaced due to a house fire, doesn't work, would never recommend
Do not buy! Mine broke after 40 days. See review.  Really disappointed! Update 8-20.17. Zero stars should be. Now throwing unit away. Stopped working!! Also very much a pain to clean. Ridiculous all the parts you must take off. Plus you can't clean or get too some parts of machine.
Total POS  Great for pet hair but brush rotator motor broke after 2nd room.  Got string caught in it & bit the dust.  Could not find a reset button for motor like almost every other machine has.  Returned after first incomplete use.
Awful Vacuum  I help my dad clean his house and use his vacuum. This is the most annoying, horrible vacuum I have ever used. Nearly every vaccuming causes it to get clogged. I have to spend a very patient 15 minutes each time trying to figure out where the clog is coming from. I also couldn't believe how much dirt was in the carpet each time since there isn't much dirt outside. After reading the other reviews, I realized it's not dirt, but carpet fibers being shredded. The roller brush often jams and it smells like it's burning because the rubber stoppers at the ends are melting along with the hose.
Where are the vacuum lines?!?  I don't get what all the fuss is about. This product works like well ... A basic vacuum. It's lightweight but at the same time the lack of weight also leaves a lack of cleaning power. It leaves no vacuum lines in the carpet so I don't feel like the brushes are really gripping the dirt off the surface.  I'm sending it back. Just didn't live up to the hype.
Disappointing performance  Contrary to the indication that this vacuum removed pet hair - it performed poorly.  We expected more from Kenmore and are uncertain as to why this one failed to live up to its reputation. Also, this seller did NOT stand behind its product and gave us only excuses instead of providing a product that worked as advertised. We will not purchase another Kenmore vacuum or do business with Musichunters2 again.
Poor quality. Handle broke soon after purchase. Customer service is poor.
Leiftheit sweeper  Product was easy to assemble and packaged well.  That've about it.  It does not donna good job  even picking up lint on carpets.  I would have returned it except I did notnkeepnthe box.
You're better off if the thing DOES break.  The vacuum worked okay for a couple of years and then just decided to stop working one day.  Even though we rarely used the self driving feature, it broke.  But even though we weren't using the self drive feature at the time and would have happily used the vacuum without it, it won't budge at all, even with the self drive turned to off.  It just freezes the entire machine like putting breaks on.  So we went out to buy a new vac and this time ended up with the low end Dyson vac thinking that we'd just get the Hoover fixed under warranty.  Forget the Hoover!  I went over the same piece of carpet that the Hoover died on and pulled up a full canister worth of dirt that the Hoover left behind.  No point in getting warranty work on something that obviously wasn't doing the job in the first place.  I've owned Hoover vacs for over 30 years, but they just lost a customer.  I've got far more into my carpet than their vacuum is worth.
major design flaw  I bought this vacuum b/c of the size and weight. We have hardwood floors and a BIG dog, so the need to vacuum is a daily occurance. Initially I liked this vac, because it was light and fairly easy to use.  A few minor details-the cord is too short, and the filter gets full quickly, requiring you to remove it and bang it against the side of the trashcan to get the gunk out of the folds. This usually causes a pretty big dust cloud.  These things are a little annoying, but not "deal busters". The MAJOR design flaw is that the exhaust comes out the front of the vacuum, right above the head. This results in any dust bunnies, dog hair or other lightweight stuff becoming airborn in a cloud ahead of you, and the larger stuff, acting like tumbleweed and rolling ahead of you.  You can really tell on a sunny day with the sun coming through the window. Basically you end  up stirring up and breathing all that stuff in. Yuck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Bottom line-great idea, poor execution!
I thought it was us at first but the only thing the vacuum is good for is to use on hardwood floors  We have had this vacuum for over a year.  There are issues with the height settings and you are unable to push the vacuum forward unless you set to 5-7.  I thought it was us at first but the only thing the vacuum is good for is to use on hardwood floors. I wish we never bought and I am now looking at other brands.  Save your money.
Terrible quality  I bought it from Amazon in 2012. It literally burst in flames after 1 month of being used for 20 minutes twice a week. Amazon replaced it immediately - no problems. The plastic connector from the head to the hose of the second identical Oreck Little Hero cracked in in two months. I put tape around it and kept vacuuming once a week. The motor broke after three months (5 months of usage in general). I gave up on this particular vacuum cleaner and Oreck in general. Very sad.
Horrible thing!  Doesn't pik up well at all---hard to clean  and not worth the money !!  I threw it away !  " (
Stopped working after 10mn!!!!  I was so happy to received it! After 10mn using it, it stopped working completely! I have to finish washing my floor with my good old mop! Will send it back!
Broke after less than a year  I live in a small apartment with no pet and I have had this vacuum for less than a year and the motor has blown out already. And when it did work, it was not very powerful, I would have to run it over an area several times so it would pick up small scraps on the carpet. And the brush roll gets clogged easily. I would not recommend this unless you are needing something temporary
Complete piece of crap and waste of money  This vacuum never worked. It was on sale at Target and I bought it for the cheap price, and got what I paid for. The "power paw" upholstery attachment doesn't work by design. The duster just moves dust around without picking it up. The hose works but is a royal pain to use and has no reach. The brush just throws things back out behind the vacuum cleaner, and it just won't pick anything up. It does a great job of putting a lot of dust in the air and all over itself while it's running, though. Complete crap. Don't even touch it. I'll say "Eureka!" when I see a Eureka that picks up debris off the floor.
This vacuum ... and not in a good way.  I have this model and it is the bane of my existence. It's true it is relatively quiet, but that's because it doesn't work. It has the power of an asthmatic mouse. Hoover is a great brand, and one that can be trusted. but this vacuum is wretched. I just think that this is their Edsel.
Complete waste of money  I ordered this as a replacement for an Electrolux Green Machine that was stolen. I thought this would be similar, but would also work on carpets since it has a beater bar. Turns out, it doesn't work well on carpets OR bare floors. This now sits in my closet since I purchased a Shark Lift-a-way that I absolutely love.
Disappointed in vacuum and Company  Thought it was a great vacuum at first, until the 1st time I used it the belt of the powerhead came off.  Given the vacuum the benefit of doubt I thought it might have come loose in shipping....so I put it back on. Then the next week I went to vacuum it came off again...getting really aggrivated  I took the machine into my office and called customer assistance (which come to find out that beings we purchased it to use at church our warranty is void) After answering a lot of questions ...they didn't offer any solutions, made note of it and said in not so many words...can't help you but we will send a new complimentary belt. Have a nice day! Don't waste your money .Linda
V curve in the front very annoying  I bought this several years ago and tried to get used to it for about 6 months.  I would have much preferred a straight vacuum head than this V.  It was very annoying and I finally donated it.
There is a weird toxic/foul smell that comes from the exhaust when it is running.
You get what you pay for?  We barely had this out of the box before we realized we should return it. The retractable cord didn't retract, for one thing, even  after trying all the tricks in the book for that problem.  In general though, we knew it was a cheap vacuum, but we didn't epect the parts and attachments to really seem *this* cheap.  It seemed more like a toy vacuum than something really serviceable.
Do not buy  Do not buy this vacuum. It is a piece of garbage.  Hoover advises to bring in for service.  It has been serviced three times already.  Now it is collecting dust and dirt in crevice by roller bar. Bought a Shark rotator and there is so much dirt and hair on the carpet that was picked up by the Shark
The worst vacuum I've ever owned  The worst vacuum I've ever owned. In fact, I cannot think of a single thing that's tolerable. Completely disappointed. I've had other Dysons and cannot believe this is made by the same company. Total garbage.
Might destroy your floors  My number one complaint about this vacuum is that the spinning brush on the bottom of the vacuum cannot be turned off. That means that when you're using the wand, it's just sitting there, spinning, slowly grinding away at whatever the vacuum is sitting on. This always bothered me in theory, but today it actually ground through the surface of the linoleum floor in the laundry room as I used the wand to vacuum up kitty litter (see photo in the customer photos section).  If you're trying to vacuum the stairs, be careful when you move the vacuum because I wouldn't like to find out what happens when that spinning brush grinds through your toes.  The vacuum comes with (too) many tools. The pet-hair-specific tools sound good in theory, but they really don't seem to work any better than the standard tools. I never use them and find that the upholstery brush works best for getting pet hair off of chairs and small spaces.  That said, the vacuum does do a good job of vacuuming. It has pretty strong suction and it does do a good job getting the cat hair out of the carpet, although I'm not really convinced that it works better than any other new vacuum. The bin that collects the dirt is pretty easy to empty and the filter is pretty easy to change. Overall, build quality seems sufficient, but some parts don't exactly inspire confidence.  Summary (+/-): + Good suction + Brush on bottom of vacuum does a good job on the carpets - Brush won't stop spinning - Brush may eat through your floors - Constantly spinning brush seems dangerous, although I've managed to avoid getting body parts sucked up into it so far - Heavy - Pet-hair-specific tools are basically useless, add to weight, and aren't really attached to the vacuum too well so they fall off the vacuum body all the time (I don't know why I keep putting them back on) - Hose quickly loses elasticity (not a lot, but enough) so it won't really stay where its supposed to. This isn't really a huge problem, but it's sort of annoying and messy. - The end of the hose plugs back into the base in order to route suction to the bottom of the vacuum. If the hose gets unplugged, then you lose suction at the bottom. My old Eureka had a switch to go between base and hose suction. I think the switch is a much better design. (This is also how the Eureka determined it was time to turn off the spinning brush.)
Wife hates it. Has the feeling of a toy.
This vacuum is the absolute worst vacuum I have ever owned  This vacuum is the absolute worst vacuum I have ever owned! After reading all the positive reviews I had to tell my story! My husband purchased this vacuum from Sears as one of my Christmas presents (I know I'm one lucky girl (:!  For the ten years prior I have been the proud owner of a dyson animal vacuum . The only reason I wanted a new DYSON vacuum is mine was a older model with the brush bar activated by a clutch belt system. I had Dudon replace the clutch assembly twice in the last 3 years and figured I deserved a upgrade. We have a small beach at our house, 2 kids with a lot of friends and 2 dogs. During the summer I vacuumed at least every other day and I'm talking major amounts of dirt and dog hair. So Christmas Day I got this Samsung futuristic looking vacuum with this wonderful hand held wand for stair cleaning and the salesman said its the same thing as a DYSON. Well let me just say there is no substitute for DYSON animal vacuums. The Samsung never had much suction and the handheld vacuum had zero suction from day one. I troubleshot it through the company and you tube videos but never found the problem by September of this year the vacuum won't even turn off or on and the thing has barely been used! Yes I still vacuumed a lot but not with this worthless vacuum; I borrowed my friends DYSON animal ball vacuum and only used the Samsung if I had to. I'm going to be calling Samsung this week and will update this review with the outcome as the vacuum comes with a 5 year warranty I would love to have the money refunded so I can put it towards a new DYSON However . I am willing to have accept a new vacuum and see if it's any better then the lemon I was stuck with STAY TUNED if you have a high traffic household this is not the vacuum for you! I only gave it 1 star because the system made me!!
Not good for really getting your floors clean all the way to the baseboards  it cleans the middle of the floor nicely terrible around the edges   it simply doesnt reach under things or even get close to corners you have to do a lot of hand wiping along the baseboards  Also, you have a real mess to clean up it says you simply flush it down the toilet but thats not true but here in the water get mixed up some of the hair gets stuck on the top so you have to rinse it all out and get your hands in there anyway and hope it doesnt go down the sink this is gross
HATE WASTING MY TIME!  I bought this because I was trying to stay away from 'work one year eurekas.'  In that aspect it was a success.  It lasted for two.  It is heavy, too heavy to do stairs with, and looks substantial but a Dyson it is NOT!  It couldn't live up to the challenge of pet hair and was cumbersome to maneuver.  It finally died after two years, and my DH is one that takes them apart and rescusitates them for a bit longer.  Not bad since eurekas tend to die after a year.  We finally did get that dyson and boy did we see the difference.  Amazing for heavy duty spring cleaning.  For the downstairs every day use, I HIGHLY recommend a Bissell Helix I think is the name.  Amazing suction on pet hair.  If I have to replace that every year, I'll do so gladly because it cleans really well
Would not recommend this product just becasue of this  Thsi product broke literally 7 days after the 30 day warranty Amazon provides expired. Would not recommend this product just becasue of this.
Wished I could use mine---Tank leaked from the beginning!!  I bought this a few months ago and from the beginning the tank that you put the water & cleaner in leaked constantly.  I could never leave cleaner in it to use the next day for example, it always leaked out into the floor.  And now plastic piece that releases the water to clean the floor that's inside that tank has broken into several pieces so it's totally useless now....  My friend has one and has never had any problems with hers - she can leave cleaner in her tank and never has any leaks.... I was disappointed and wish I could receive a tank that didn't leak.  I see the cleaning ability of my friend's unit and know that it would be a great product if I didn't receive a Lemon Version!! Guess that's what happens when you buy one of the "Deal of the Day" items :(
Do not buy this product  Vacuum is way too heavy.  Works reasonably well but button/etc are a bit flimsy and don't seem to respond well.  Retractable power cord broke the 3rd day I used it.  I would never buy this machine again.  Also, for the most part, I recommend a cannister over the upright.
I don't think so.  Pretty disappointing. I bought this for my kitchen ceramic tile floor. I was looking for something that would spray the cleaning fluid or water or whatever and scrub the floor and vacuum it up all in one step. This machine does just that. However, I don't believe the brushes are doing anything at all. I think the water is just being sprayed on the floor and the vacuumed up. The water became slightly dirty, so a film of dirt was being sucked up, but the machine was unable to remove any spots on the floor, however small. I noticed that when the water was sprayed on the floor, and I put the brushes down over it, it hardly changed the pattern of the water on the floor. In other words, the brushes were ineffective. I still had to hand wipe any spots on the floor. Maybe if you wanted to sponge mop the floor and then vacuum up the water afterwards with this machine it might be useful. But it's pretty heavy and pretty loud you may as well use a smaller wet dry vac. I am going to search for another brand that might be better. Good news is, the return is free and easy. So nothing lost. I still love shopping on Amazon. They are the greatest!
Look elsewhere  Horrible.  The way it's designed it has to be taken apart every time I vacuum and the tubes snaked out with a wire.  Now the belt is shot, and looking at this review here: https://www.amazon.com/review/R3BLTOSAMROAQ4/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015OIZE8&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=1055398&store=home-garden  and looking at the way the thing is designed, the belt is designed to break constantly.  Don't listen to the good reviews, I've only actually used this thing like 20 times and the belt is already broken.
Had to return it  Too small to clean a whole house. Plastic attachments are cheap and flimsy.
Don't buy this  Over heats after 10 minutes of use. This was the 2nd one the first one dies before 30 days
Terrible designed canister vacuum  I have had Oreck vacuums for over 25 years. This is the worst designed canister vacuum I have ever seen. I am only 5'2" and yet I have to bend down to vacuum the floors. The canister is a terrible design.  This product has definitely convinced me never to get an Oreck product again.
wish we had gone to a store to try it out  :) Good suction. Retractable cord! Ranked high on Consumer Reports  :( heavy, clunky started making high-pitched whine sporadically after 2 weeks of use in our small 950 sq ft NYC apartment not looking forward to changing out the container...  It's hard to see what a vacuum will be like unless you go to a brick-n-mortar store to try it out. that's what I wish we had done.  ------  UPDATE 18 months later:  My wife and I hate this thing. It's too heavy, it OVERHEATS and stops working after three or four minutes, it doesn't clean our carpets very well. It's also a pain in the butt to empty the dust canister. We really regret not sending it back after the first horrible week of using it.  ------  Update 2.5 years later: splurged on a Dyson DC40 (mothers day sale, 20% off) and now I LOVE TO VACUUM AGAIN. (Its very calming and "zen".) Wish we had just done that in the becinning (we suffered for three years with two unlovable vacuums before we took the risk... so glad that we did.)
Good price, bad product.  Didn't last 10 minutes before the belt broke.
Not happy  I have hardwood floors everywhere in my house.  I am disappointed that this vacuum does not pick up dust bunnies without me picking up the vacuum and setting it down on top of the dust or having to pull the handheld piece out.  I feel that I have to sweep my floor and then vacuum up the fine dust.  I also do not like that there is not much flexibility in the handheld part.  It is long and hard to maneuver in small areas.  Do not think it is worth the money.
A lemon  My vacuum cleaner worked well the first time I used it, then the power cut on and off repeatedly every time I used it on carpet. It would only work on tile and hardwood. I took it to a Hoover authorized dealer for repair and just got home with it. Still not fixed. I called the Hoover Response Center, and they want me to take it to a different  repair shop (located further away). I am sick of dealing with it! What a lemon!
Stopped working after a while  The vacuum was working great for the first 2 months, but after that it stopped working, it just would not suck any dust even though it was on and the machine was running. I tried to see if anything was stuck, and nothing was stuck but when I put my hand on the vacuum head, it was still not sucking anything.. really disappointed with this product, and I cannot return it anymore.
Worst vacuum ever!  This is the worst vacuum I've ever owned!  It's only 8 months old and it fails to suck up the easiest things on the carpet (I don't even have a dog!!).  I have to run it over things at least 3 times...I check the filters constantly and the hose & they're not even clogged!  I have NO idea why this vacuum sucks so bad, but I would NEVER recommed it to anyone!
they do a great job when working  I have now had two of these cleans, they do a great job when working. Each one was put away fully working, then failed to switch on when next used about two weeks later. I am searching for an alternative product to do the same job as these cleaner is designed to breakdown after a limited time.
Clog Hog  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dyson-DC41-Animal-Bagless-Vacuum-Cleaner/dp/B005FQMALQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dyson DC41 Animal Bagless Vacuum Cleaner</a>&nbsp;I had high hopes for this vac.  Usually don't like bagless, with constant plugging of the filters, but high reviews had me convinced to try it.  No problem with the filters clogging, but narrow neck where all debris channel through to get to the dirt collection cup is a design flaw.  Good suction, picked up well, but stuff got caught in the narrow neck, had to stop and unplug with each use.  Sent it back, thank heavens for Amazon's return policy!!
Suctioned sucked by the second use  Do not but used vacuums is what I learned. Suctioned sucked by the second use. I was not going to spend my time trying all the sellers ideas of getting it to work. Will go back to cheaper brand new Hoovers and plan on replacing them every 3yrs.
Don't waste your time  Don't waste your time with this if you have a pet.  This vacuum worked well...until we got a dog.  Now, it barely picks up anything and leaves stuff all over the floor.  The clogs are very difficult to clean since taking this thing apart is not exactly easy.
Didn't last  Vacuum worked perfect and had my carpet standing up like new.  After one use it quit working.  We didn't vacuum anything into it that should have broken after using once.  I didn't realize until I pulled it out to use for the second time that it quit working.
Great cleaning power while it lasted  The  motor blew up after just eighteen months. Great cleaning power while it lasted,  but very heavy.
Seems like they had to go out of their way to ruin such a good line of vacuums  Owned a Kenmore Progressive model after several yrs of service (which also replaced another Kenmore canister predecessor). Motor finally blew and I sought it current offset. Based on this model being favorably rated by CR, I bought it and CANNOT tell you how disappointed I was- returned after a day. Where to begin?? I will say that until I finally rage quit on this piece of garbage, it did actually have good pick up- a vacuums primary directive. That's what makes it so ironic that I literally couldn't use the machine despite that. First- the pop & go feature is virtually useless. You will soon feel like a fool when it dawns on you that it would have taken you a fraction of the time to attach the head by manually snapping it in as opposed to the trial and error misery of doing so using the 'pop' feature. No biggie! I just won't use that 'feature' I said to myself. That would be all well and good, except for the fact that the same 'pop' feature makes the door cover flop open MANY times while moving up and down stairs. Second- the cord randomly goes back in the housing on its own. Thinking it was a fluke with the mechanism, I just pulled it out again and then (paying more attn) saw it continue to reel itself back in every couple minutes. Best Part? I found it would not reel in the entire cord when I DID press the button. Again, a complete exercise in frustration as I repeatedly pressed said button, watched it reel in a foot or two, pulled it out a bit, pressed button again.. rinse and repeat. Third- Whomever the prodigy engineer was that had the brilliant 'innovative' idea of putting a suction power SLIDER button on the handle has never actually used the vacuum for more than 10 minutes, because if they did they'd see it constantly slides itself to the lowest setting!
Still trying to get parts after 4 weeks & 3 phone calls  I ordered this in November, when it came the handle would not screw into the body of the bachine.  The label said to call Hoover if any prolemsb, not the store, which I did.  The person I spoke to said they would send out another handle, what color was my machine so they would sesnd the correct color handle  Told them it was grey...3 days later I received the handle......it was blue.  Called again, told them and they said they would send the correct color handle...that was 2 1/2 weeks ago, I still have not receved it and am now going to call for the last time.  If this doesn't work, I will be contacting Amazon for some sort of end to this,.  I am very disappointed in Hoover, I have had this machine for almost a month and still can't use it.
Already using duct tape (and now rubber bands)  Just had to write this today after receiving my Consumer Reports with this vacuum on the cover. I'm a long-time Hoover Windtunnel user - 4 or 5 generations. Decided to switch it up this time because the Hoovers just seemed to be getting cheaper and cheaper. Well Sears seems to be manufacturing the same way. Have had the Intuition since Jan. 13. The tool for sofa/chairs hardly ever spins correctly and is tiny compared to Hoover version. I actually duct-taped the old Hoover tool to old Hoover wand and shove the wand into the Intuition's wand. Not the best fit but it works. Also on the Intuition, I had to duct tape where the wand connects to the hose because it just keeps turning and coming apart. As far as the power, I would say the two vacs are similar. Will probably switch back to Hoover, or make the step up in the vac world to Miele. I have mostly carpet in my house.  Update Oct. 18, 2013: Today that clip that holds the hose at the top broke. Failure happened near holes for screws. Was not abusing vacuum or forcing it. I only vacuum every 2 weeks (no pets, no kids at home any more). Called Sears. Only option was to drive almost an hour to drop off for repair. One-year warranty on parts. What a pain and I'm not sure I'm going to bother. I'm using rubber bands to hold the hose on now.
Very disappointed.  I wish I could add to the glowing reviews, but my Shark vacuum stopped working 7 months after I bought it. The brush roller stopped rotating and the vacuum repair guy said it was a problem with the circuit board and it couldn't be replaced. All I know is that a $300 vacuum should last longer than 7 months.
I started to notice that the suction was not as good as when I first bought it  Well I  purchased this vacuum about 18 months ago.  I started to notice that the suction was not as good as when I first bought it.  I am currently walking the vacuum out to the trash because it will no longer will turn on.  I would recommend looking for a different product.  Good luck
Junk  I bought this vacuum from a brick & mortar store after talking to the sales person. In 2 months the plastic wheel in side that the belt connects to the roller broke in half. I called the parts number on their web site and was told I could only buy the part from an authorized repair shop.  After going to multiple shops that was listed on the Eureka web site only one was able to buy a part for it based off of what Eureka said I needed. It turned out to be the wrong part & after me & the store argued with the Eureka parts people on trying to order the right part. I gave up. I use mine now on none carpet floors only. Going to buy dirt devil like I had before it last 6 years or maybe a Hover. Eureka makes their vacuums out of cheap parts that break easily that cannot be replaced. Do not buy!
Quick loss of suction  Unfortunately, the vacuum lost suction within weeks upon purchase. The reason remains unclear. I followed the problem solving guide of the manufacturer but the problem remains.
UPDATED: IS THIS REALLY ELECTROLUX?!?!??  See at the bottom.  This is a hardworking all-purpose vacuum.  It is mostly excellent, with just a few things about it that are less convenient.  It's a canister vac, but it follows well, without me having to constantly pull it around.  Also, the power cord extends easily as needed as I move - nice feature!  It retracts at the foot-push of a button; but watch out - it retracts FAST!  It's bagless, which is nice for not having to buy bags, but some of the dust goes flying when I dump it.  I like the height / length of the straight part (not sure what it's called), the upright piece.  I don't have to bend way over to have a nice long reach with it.  One oddity is that there are two separate power switches: one for the suction power, and another for the beater head.  The one for the beater is right on the handle, which is convenient, and an intuitive location.  I used that first, and wondered why the vac didn't start - and had to hunt to find the other switch, a foot button on the canister.  Why not have just the one switch?  I have a basic Oreck upright vac, which does an excellent job on carpets, but has no tools or attachments.  This Electrolux is equally good (far as I can tell) on the floors.  As for the tools, two of them store nicely under the collection bin, but the others do not have any storage place built for them.  In my house, that means they are likely to get lost soon.  And that leads to the other quirk - storing this thing is AWKWARD.  The hose is stiff, the canister is oddly shaped, and the handle-pole-beater is oddly balanced (for storage - it's fine for in-use).  So it takes up more space than such a compact vac should.  Minor complaints aside, it works well and all-around, so it is a solid four stars from me.  UPDATE:  We had this for about six months before a part broke.  Where the floor part joins the upright handle, is a plastic swivel piece, so the "head" can turn - the plastic swivel broke.  So, my dear mother-in-law (MIL) took it to an authorized Electrolux vacuum repair shop and paid in advance for the repair.  I don't know how she knows about these things, but she does.  Anyway, the shop is trying to get the part.  Trying to get the part.  Trying to get the part.  Six, count 'em, SIX weeks later, she calls them, and they say that this isn't really an Electrolux vacuum, it's part of some "Electrolux Home" company from Sweden, and that in this country it's really sold as an "Eureka" vacuum.  I swear I am NOT making this up!!! (with thanks to Dave Barry).  She emails the national Electrolux customer service, and.... well, at this point, the shop is going to refund her money and refer her to a Eureka repair shop.  So my formerly four star review is now basically summed up as: I like it while it works, but if it breaks, good luck getting it fixed!  And good luck not getting the run-around in the process.
not worth it's salt  My roommate bought this vacuum and I used it in our basement where my two medium to long-haired cats reside. Not impressed in the least.  First of all, the pet hair attachments are utterly useless. They're basically rubbery lint brushes. I had to pick the cat hair out of the little nubs every 2 minutes. After 10 minutes, I gave up and just used the hose.  It seems to have powerful suction because it was lifting the carpet up when vacuuming. But upon inspection of the carpet, I still saw cat hair fuzz-balls everywhere. I had to go over each area many, many times. It'll also fray the bajeezus out of any rug or carpet edge that isn't nailed down.  Taking the vacuum upstairs and down was a chore in itself. VERY HEAVY.  Then comes emptying the tiny container. I didn't realize where the full line was on the canister. After vacuuming one medium sized room, the hair and dust had crammed into the upper half of the bin. As others have said, it's merely a trap for hair and dirt. I pulled out the canister and most of the dust either poofed into the air or dumped on me and the bottom of the vacuum. I had to reach up inside the upper half to pull out the rest of the hair which was incredibly gross. It's such a huge flaw to have the removable part of the canister so tiny, yet the upper part of it to be so large and to trap hair.  I would never buy this vacuum. I had much more success with my $40, 10 lb., discount outlet vacuum. Tall canister, minimal attachments, extremely portable. I will definitely go back to using this.  Don't be swayed by the marketing or name brand. Unless you only have 1 small short haired dog in a single level home, this vacuum is utterly useless.
Product assembly time intensive  Vacuum arrived within short time of order placement.  However, the vacuum assembly took a lot of time.  Then the screws did not fit the unit correctly.  Item was returned.  Return was smooth.  Another brand vacuum was ultimately purchased.
DONT BUY!!! from this vendor....bought new got a returned vacuum!  Bought and paid for a new vacuum....got someone elses old returned vacuum! Rediculous and disgusting....smells like bug spray too!
Dead Almost on Arrival  Bought this for heavy-duty cleaning (I have pets). Pulled it out and used it. It immediately filled up. So, I cleaned it out and went back at the job and it just up and died on me. Am not thrilled. Checked the negative reviews that said it overheats and needs 30 minutes to cool down. Sure enough, it started up again 30 minutes later, but now, it won't pick anything up. Really?! I don't even like vacuuming in the first place and you make it harder?!! DO NOT BUY.
Does not suck dirt,so the vacuum sucks  I purchased this vacuum mainly because it is a dyson and was on sale,I thought what a great deal I am making. As soon as I got it i tried it ,gor the carpet I think it did a decent job,but for the hardwood floor did not do one thing. While vacuuming the floor i realized that it was not sucking at all,I had to go over a crumb several times and still did not pick it up. Before Ipurchased it a read the reviews and because there were couple that stated was. A great vacuum I decided to try it. I feel like for the price I paid was a rip off. Maybe mine was just deffe ctive so I will ake it back tomorrow and tryanother one,if that won't work either that will be the last Dyson I will try.
after 3, 4 uses is not working anymore
BEWARE- AWFUL!  Awful!!  Works okay on hard wood floors but so does a broom or  $19. electric stick.  Even though you can turn the brush on the bottom on or off, it is absolutely impossible to use on area rugs on either setting.  It will literally not move and is only self propelled on hardwoods. Also difficult to move on carpet, regardless if brush is on or off.  There is no setting for carpet height and sits flat on the floor, grinding the brush into the carpet. .  The base of the unit is very small , only 12 inches, so it takes numerous passes to sweep an average size room.  The brush is tiny and if you have pets, will be full almost immediately and jam and stop working.  The bagless canister is very small as well and has to be emptied after sweeping just one area.  This vacuum is horrible.
Be prepared to fix the drive belt every time you run the vacuum. EVERY time.  A very, very frustrating vacuum and not one I would buy again or recommend. It is very powerful and great at picking up cat hair, as I read in Consumer Reports. However, it is a VERY heavy vacuum and thus difficult to manhandle around. More importantly, the brush frequently stops when hairs wrap around it and one of the belts running the brush slips off its spindle nearly every time we use the vacuum, which means we have to spend half an hour unscrewing the bottom plate, cleaning the brush, and fixing the belt with nearly every use. We discovered, sadly after we bought the machine, that the belt comes off so frequently and for so many customers that there are several videos on YouTube showing you the trick to slipping the belt back onto its spindle.
WORST DESIGN EVER  This is the worst product ever because the belt breaks constantly.  We have owned this vacuum less than 4 months and have to replace the belt at least once every time we use it. (And lest you wonder: we have had, up until now, a long and proud family history of being able to successfully vacuum without breaking belts.)  Even the "Genuine Eureka Extended style" belts are no match for this vacuum, which appears to have a design flaw that makes the belt rub constantly until it frays and breaks. We realized this right away, but the box had unfortunately been put in the recycling bin so we couldn't return this product. I am finally admitting the fact that trashing this and buying a new vacuum is going to be cheaper than buying a gazillion belts. Ironically, it works wonderfully in the brief window of time before the belt breaks. I recommend you do not purchase this unless you own a belt factory. Or unless you enjoy military-style precision planning of which strips of carpet most need to be vacuumed during the few precious minutes you actually have a functioning belt.
Falls apart  The stupid Swivel C-Clip Connector (#DY-922466-01) kept coming loose, and finally broke because it wade of cheap plastic.
DO NOT BUY!!!  Vacuum worked great for 2.5 months then just stopped for no reason. I was only using it once a week as I am a single man and not home much. Will not buy again. DO NOT BUY!!!
Terrible suction  This vacume is a waste of money. I cannot even pick up a thread or any lint on the floor unless I pick it up with my hand. I am terribley disappointed in this product....NO SUCTION. This is a con..do not purchase this product!!
Don't do it....you will regret it...  I got this vacuum back in July. It worked great for the first few times I vacuum. Then my dog started shedding bad. The hose constantly clogs, so I have to struggle to clear it out. It now seems the suction isn't as good as it was. And it smells like the belt it burning.....DONT do it, spend a few more bucks on something that will last. I regret my decision to be cheap!
Major disappointment  Very disappointed with performance of Model 3030 Floormate SpinScrub 500, particularly the scrubbing action.  Brushes barely touch floor and are virtually useless trying to remove grime from tile floor. Vacuuming action either in DryVac or Wet Pickup mode seems underpowered.  Final straw was when I went to local retailer to ask him to look at machine. His response was to say he had stopped selling this model as it was giving his store a bad name.  Hoover should discontinue this POS.
Just...no.  FWIW I hovered between 1 and 2 stars...very tough choice, between "I hate it" and "I don't like it".  The only reason I ended up with 2 instead of one is the incredible price point.  It really is amazing what you get for the retail price, but my God, spend a little more and get a real vac.  If you can't or won't spend $50 more dollars to get a better one, just let it go dirty!  Reason is that this thing will drive you crazy when you use it as intended, which is dragging it behind you.  The negs: 1. It is insanely top heavy, and poorly designed so that it topples over if you look at it too hard. 2. The cord is extremely short (obviously can be fixed using an extension cord) 3. The smell!  I thought this was a first time use thing, but even after a few hours use, this thing puts out some foul odor that to me smells like burnt rubber...awful.  I also checked the bags to find out if that was the cause...nope...likely some shortcut used in manufacturing to hit the price point is to blame here...maybe a QA issue.  The positives: 1. Cost? 2. It has DECENT suction, not great. 3. It's very lightweight - great for toting up and down stairs.  Overall, please just save up some money and get something else...anything else.
Broken within 6 months and about 8 uses.  Flimsy. For its price, unsurprising. Cord pooped out and Hose extension tore. broken within 6 months of purchase.
It is very convenient as it is wireless but the suction is very weak and is not good at all  I have had this vacuum for more than a year. It is very convenient as it is wireless but the suction is very weak and is not good at all. It leaves a lot of things behind.  I would call this an electric broom and not a vacuum.  Would never buy again !!!!!!!
Don't bother  One of the worst vacuums I every bought. It's made of cheap plastic.  One of the parts broke after first use.  The vacuum falls over on a regular basis, it burnt a hole in our carpet and the attachments aren't long enough to reach much of anything!
JUNK
Way to heavy...all ready have my heavy duty vac!
Poor performance  This product does not perform as advertised.  It does not clean up to wall edges, it stops 1 inch away and doesnt even get close to corners.  It also leaves a dingy film on hard wood floors.
DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE I DID!! DO NOT BUY A DYSON!!! My Dyson is doing the same GRINDING!! I was suckered in to thinking this was a fabulous vacuum, Nope!! I'm done with DYSON!! I spoke with a vacuum repair man and he said RUN!!
Dont bother  Don't bother purchasing this junk. It works for the first month or so, but then it looses its sucking power. The canaster is also very small. So if you have a lot of dirt or pet hair you will have to empty it atleast once while using it.
We have used for a month and the brush stopped sucking!!!!
Sucks............. but that's all it does........ and not in a good way.  This thing never cleaned very well. It did an okay job for a while. It would clean but leave a lot of streaks. Then it just stopped dispensing the solution. At this point (having to manually spray the solution and hand buff the floor with towels on my hands and knees). I think the linkage that pumps the solution broke.  I threw it out.
Cheap made  and bearly does the job...
Real Disappointment  I bought this vacuum because I didn't have the strength to push a heavy vacuum. This is a heavy, hard to push machine and the self- propel feature is useless.  I have had a Hoover before and liked it just fine. As it turned out my grandson was getting his first apartment so instead of returning it I just gave it to him.
Never again!! horrible product  I have had several Hoovers over the years and I love the product this vacuum cleaner is the biggest joke in the world do not buy it!! I have spent as much as the vacuum in replacement parts the water tank gets hair line fractures and the water just pours out. $230.00 later not to mention the price of $250.00 for the vacuum. I bought a used sears vacuum from the 80's Blows it away!!! For $60.00 and if it breaks in the trash it goes the water cylinder is 59.00 on the Hoover!! Bought three so far and if I turn that thing on it will be 4.
DO NOT BUY: Oreck must live on their 1970's and 80's advertising.  Their adds suggest quality, but their products do not.  I don't know if this is their first venture into bag less vacs, but I hope it is their last.  This is simply a piece of junk.  The wheels act like they are going to fall off and the noise is actually louder than the vac itself.  We have had this for one year and just found out the motor filters are no longer available.  It won't work when this filter gets clogged, so basically we got one year out of this $300 dollar piece of plastic.
Five Years, Three Cheap Hoovers - You'd Think I'd Learn  Not worth the $90 I paid for it on a lightning deal back in December '15. I've gone through three of these in the past five years. Shame on me for not learning before now, but never again with Hoover. Problem this time is a motor that overheats and shuts off after about five minutes of vacuuming. Read up on it-common problem. Previous problems on prior vacuums included a roller brush that constantly threw its belt, cord re-winders that stop working, dust filter that wouldn't stay inserted into the front of the vacuum, and constantly overheating motors. This is not the same Hoover that used to be a reliable brand. Suspect it was probably bought out by equity investors who slashed quality and costs and are trying to ring every last bit of goodwill out of the old brand-name they can. You know, maximizing short-term shareholder profit and all of that.
Not the best, but not the absolute worst either...  I've had this thing for almost a year. At first, I was satisfied. It seemed to clean really well. But, I noticed after vacuuming my home just twice, there was a dramatic loss of suction power. The filter at the top of the dust cup is the culprit - if you don't take it out and clean it every time you empty this machine, you will not have any suction. Even after cleaning the filter, it loses suction about halfway through vaccuming my home. Also, not impressed with the "turbo" hand tool - I have to use a lint roller to get the rest of the pet hair off of my couch when I'm done vacuuming it. All in all, I don't like it. I want something else...I'm thinking about going for a Kenmore or Hoover canister...
Worked well at first. Now suction is poor, overheats and shuts off while in use very quickly ( only using it to vacuum my 550sq foot apt) I would not recommend this vacuum.
Good start, but won't last  This vacuum worked well for the first several months, but poor materials, design, and construction are letting it down.  PROS -Intelliclean works effectively -Does an excellent job of cleaning carpets -The hard floor tool works pretty well -Filtration system works great, and there are many bag suppliers out there. -Nice long power cord.  CONS -The suction-powered pet hair tool worked great for the first week, then locked up and the agitator won't spin (it rubs on the inside of the tool).  Lubrication was ineffective.  Nothing is physically stuck in the tool...it's just a terrible design with cheap plastic.  No bearings or other devices to stave off wear on the plastic-on-plastic design. -The hard plastic hose extensions are made of cheap plastic.  The nub that locks the extensions together broke within a few months, so now the hose attachments won't stay affixed to the hose.  I had to drive a pan head screw where the platic nub was, and that actually works great...take a hint Kenmore! -The foot pedal that releases the vacuum from its upright storage position broke.  Had to order another one. -The hose retaining clip on the bottom back of the vacuum broke.  Had to order another one.  I am a big fan of Consumer Reports, but they suffer two problems.  One, they don't evaluate the quality of construction of the products they review.  Two, they have limited time and other resources, so they only review a small fraction of the products available.  In the case of vacuums, they ignored several of the highest-rated models on Amazon.
do not buy refurbished! I sent back!
2nd one hieght adjustment broke!  This is our 2nd Bissell turbo upright. Both of them ended up having the hieght adjustment knob detent spring strip. You can't adjust the hieght on thevvaccum,its stuck at one hieght. I feel it wasn't due to heavy handed use,but a cheap,bad design. Its a nice vaccuum,but watch out with the hieght adjustment.
Like driving an uncontrollable truck  Well, if you need a vacuum that handles like a dream....don't buy this one...Disappointing.  I know this is a late review, but needs to be said.
Don't believe the hype  Dyson is no better than hoover. I have owned several makes of vacuums and can honestly say they all suck the same! The things I don't like-1. no retractable cord...why? For the money I paid, there should be one. 2. The power button is just above the canister release button... every time I use, I release the canister instead of turn off. 3. The detachable wand makes a whistling noise that causes my dog to howl! I cannot tell you how annoying it is...4. There are so many parts to clean it's ridiculous. It's not as simplified as Ol' James advertises it. 5. No adjustable height on base plate to be found! I have mostly hardwood floors and tile in my house with an occasional area rug or gel pro mat. When vacuuming, when pieces of dog or cat food are in my path, even cat litter-the vac just pushes them. I have to lift the vac and try to maneuver the swiveling two-piece unit to pick them up. I would adjust the height a little but the active baseplate is supposed to do that for me. 6. Where-o-where do the attachments live? There is no conceivable way to mount the tools on the unit. I think you need a Masters in engineering to figure the spot to dock them when not using. I put them in my junk drawer.
My First Hoover  I read all the reviews I could find and finally settled on the WindTunnel Bagless, I was a little cautious about the bagless concept and about the comments about the handle being weak.  Well the vacuum is great, love the bagless, but I do agree with the other reviewers the handle is weak and doesn't stand up on its own very well. Overall I am very pleased though.
Didn't Last  I've had this vacuum now for almost a year, and it didn't last.  The cat's paw attachment stopped working, and then the pedal to switch between floor and tools got harder and harder to make the brush roller stop or start.  It chewed up the new belt I installed.  Don't know if I did something wrong, but it was very difficult to change and put back together.
total junk. don't waste your money.  My 15+ year old wonderful Sharp vacuum finally broke and, since they don't make them anymore I'm borrowing and shopping for a new vacuum. I borrowed this from a friend. I can't imagine anyone would be fool enough to spend 50 dollars, let alone 400, for this vacuum. I does a terrible job of piking up all the dirt from my area rugs. My house is all natural floors and the hose piece is so short I had a terrible back ache after just on room. Additionally, the hose attachment is so tiny and doesn't move it's almost worthless to use. Do NOT waste money on one of these. I'm planning on purchasing a Riccar vacuum, which is the same price AND made in the US.
biggest piece of crap ever  Do not buy this product.  First you have to be an engineer to even assemble it let alone use it.  Next it made huge scratches in my hardwood floor.  This was the biggest mistake we have ever made in purchasing product.  The things weighs close to 30 pounds so it would be almost impossible to lug up and down stairs easily.  Plus it is supposed to be pet friendly (one of the main reasons I bought it)  yet you have to disassemble it piece by piece to even get to the roller and then you have to take the dog hairs out by pulling.  What a Joke. And this is supposed to be the best vacuum cleaner.  Really?.  I will not only never buy a vacuum cleaner from Dyson but no other Dyson products either. What a joke.  This product really SUCKS and not in a good way. Beware.
Waste of Money!  I wrote the following review for the other, supposedly professional, version of this Oreck and including it here for anyone considering one of these:  I loathe our Oreck hand-held for many reasons: Hose is too short, it kept coming out of the vacuum's connector so I glued it in and it has torn repeatedly, and now it is even shorter; the floor brush bulldozes the dirt forward and backward unless you lower the wand handle going forward so the brush is off the floor, and raise it going backward to do the same; yes it has good suction but that means the exhaust is blowing the dirt and dust it has NOT picked up all over and into the air where it then lands all over any flat surface, every time we use it there is dust everywhere; the tubes and utensils constantly fall apart because they are simply a friction fit and during use loosen up and come apart; it is almost totally ineffective for cleaning rugs and carpeting, because its a FLOOR brush; it's loud, inefficient, and a PITA to use, especially for cleaning a car because of the short hose and the utensils constantly coming off. I hate, hate, hate it! This is a consummate example of the very worst, apathetic project design standards I can think of for any product I own. Common sense was not a part of the design process. Although, I see they are now providing a Hoover style floor attachment that does work better at hard floors and for rug cleaning, I would never own another Oreck, including the upright we also own. We had a Hoover Porta Power handheld vacuum that excelled at everything the Oreck fails at. My mother-in-law bought the Oreck for my wife and she THREW OUT THE HOOVER! I'm buying another one and throwing out the Oreck. I won't even give it to the Salvation Army store - I don't want to inflict the same frustration on another person. Positive reviews have to be fake, because there is NOTHING to like about this vacuum.
Bad brand  Originally posted 5 stars because of the great things this vacuum did.... the charger stopped working after a month of use ... and hoover will not cover the item ... very disappointed... buy another brand
This was purchased as a gift.  The suction is horrible.  It blows the animal fur all over and won't even pick up a cheerio let alone a leaf.  We even replaced the filters thinking they may be defective.  Not worth the $400+ spent on it.  Extremely disappointed at the waste of money.
Only good on carpet, not hardwood or tile  While this might be good on carpet, it does NOT pick up much off floors.  The repair center was NO HELP and Hoover's giving me the runaround.
A complete waste of money  I have no idea what Hoover's engineers were thinking when they came up with this rotating HEPA filter concept...the filter stopped rotating after the second use and requires EXTENSIVE cleaning after every vacuuming session, or the suction drops to almost nothing.  You have to manually rotate the filter after each use to dislodge a ton of fine dust that plugs the filter, and usually makes a huge mess that has to be cleaned up with another vacuum while this one is disassembled.  I'd love to take it back for a refund, but it's too late now.  The first and last Hoover product I ever buy.....
I would not recommend this vacuum to anyone.  I urge you to read the negative reviews before buying this product. I did not. I only read the 4 star and above ones which sold me on purchasing this overpriced under productive piece of work. It is cheap. Cord too short, height too short, canister always falling over, wand always on floor unless I am holding it, even in storage. I am so disappointed in this cleaner. My Eureka upright which is at least 10 years old is still better than this Dyson DC39. I have had the Dyson for a couple of years and just did not want to write a negative review, but I can still not find anything positive about it. When I clean the carpet with my carpet cleaner, pet hair is constantly blocking the opening. And, that is after I have throroughly vacummed with the Dyson. I recommend you buy another brand at a much lower price.
A wolf in sheep's clothing  The perfect vacuum is a chinese knock-off of an electrolux machine made 15 years ago. The machine is not worth $100.00. It is cheaply made, prone to failure and being marketed as a high end machine. Don't be fooled by the suggested list price and its appearance. It is being made and imported from china by Nationwide onn Long Island. The hose, power nozzle, and machine are subject to a high degree of failure. If you want to purchase a good machine, buy an Aerus/electrolux vacuum. The Perfect vacuum is imperfect and the people who manufacture, distribute and sell this machine are doing a diservice to every consumer looking for quality.
The most annoying machine I've ever owned  I have the same problem several other people mentioned -- the drive belt slips off frequently. It does that when I lightly bump the carpet cleaner against a piece of furniture, or when it sucks up the carpet fringe . . . or just when it feels like it. Then it's a big deal to take it apart and put the belt back on and put it together. I don't have the other problems people mentioned, except the dirt cup fills up fast. That's probably because I avoid using it so there's lots of dirt when I do vacuum. What a waste of money!
An honest review....really  It's all about the marketing people...really.  I've had this vacuum for a few years now.  When people hear from the ads that it doesn't lose suction, they think "awesome!"  Well great suction is great for floors and carpets, but what good is it when it makes the hand tools nearly impossible to maneuver?  I mean really, you have to really strain yourself to use the hand tools.  Awful design on the hose  (not flexible enough to reach without pulling the whole vacuume along or tipping over).  If I had to do it over again, I may have paid $150 for this vacuum but definitely not $500.  Just like a lot of products out there now, the spiffy marketing campaign about the suction and cutesy design are what makes for the high sticker price, not the machine itself.
Terrible for hardwood floors, great for carpet.  Works great on carpet but struggles on hardwood floors.  It's a design flaw, please do not buy if you are wanting to use it on hardwood floors...only buy if you are only wanting to use it on carpet.  Hand held portion works fine.  I was very disappointed when we got it...hoping to be able to find one similar but without the design flaw that this one has.
Junk  Junk
Can't handle area rugs  We have hardwood floors so we have a couple of good quality area rugs for living room and dining room. Even on highest nap setting this vacuum sucks the rug up so hard you can hardly push it. After a while the belt starts smoking from the effort and whole house smells. Now I only use this vacuum for bare floors and use my old Hoover for the area rugs.
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!  I was initially really excited to get my DC39 after reading reviews and all of the hype. In the end, I feel like I've been totally had. This is BY FAR the worst appliance of any kind that I've ever purchased. I'm not sure what Mr. Dyson was thinking, but the houses in the UK must be no larger than 500 sf and everyone must be limited to owning one Jack Russell Terrier. Vacuum one room, empty the container, vacuum another, empty again, repeat, repeat. I couldn't believe it. I have a housekeeper that comes every other week, so this vacuum is only used for maintenance in between cleaning. The issue is that the canister will only hold a TINY amount of material. Heavy dirt and dust falls to the bottom, but any hair fluffs up and clogs this thing in no time. - That's when it's actually functioning. I've now had it in for repair THREE TIMES in the 9 months I've owned it. I wouldn't say that it's operated for more than a total of one hour over its lifetime. So, that's about $449 an hour since I figure I am just about done with it. It clogs, then loses suction, then starts making a high pitched wheezing sound and then it's all over (something inside starts going whacka-whacka-whacka-whacka). Total P.O.S. Total.  Even without the above obvious functional problems, in general, it's a shoddily made piece of equipment - the plastic is very cheap and it breaks easily. In fact, the little red lever that opens the canister broke the very first time I pushed to open it. The whole thing just feels incredibly cheap. Hindsight is 20/20 - I should have boxed it up right away and sent it back to Amazon. Now, I'm stuck with it - not sure anyone will even want it off of Craigslist.  It didn't help that when I went in the first time for warranty work (after only owning it for 6 weeks), the owner of the repair shop said "those are the worst in the world - when you finally give up on it, let me know and I'll sell you a real vacuum." No one ever wants to be on a first-name basis with the vacuum repair guy. It's surreal.  For less than half the price, I could have just picked up a good 'ol Wal-Mart special and I'm sure have been much happier. I wish I had that $449 back. UGH! I'll never buy any Dyson product ever again.
Worst Vacuum Ever? Well, maybe not....  Clogs too easy - must disassemble. Melts through belts on average of two uses. You'll spend about 20 minutes of down time to bring the thing back in order. I'm considering putting a small amount heat resistant electrical tape around the driveshaft where the belt comes in contact. Hopefully that may slow down the need to change belts. ---UPDATE--- The electrical tape trick actually works, and seems to run much better, So I've upgraded the performance to 3 STARS.
Completely Craptastic  I had a Dyson DC17 Animal for 6 years before it sadly passed away. Since then, I've been through 2 Shark vacuums (both of which were absolutely awful, and I wouldn't recommend them at ALL), and as of the purchase of THIS Dyson, *2* of those. I purchased this one based on the positive reviews for it & the fact that it touts "multi-floor" as well as being the "old-style" Dyson that I love. (The ball vacuum I purchased prior to this one was awful, and Dyson's attention to detail & desire to produce a quality product has drastically declined.)  I'd love to give this vacuum cleaner zero stars, but I'm giving it 1 because it works well on BARE FLOORS. That's it. Period.  My home is 100% hardwood and tile. I have 5 area rugs throughout, and all are low-pile. I also have 2 cats & a GSD. The Shark vacuums couldn't pick up hair off hardwood if it was metal and the vacuum were a magnet. The Big Ball Animal wouldn't pick it up off of the rugs. This vacuum picked it up off of the hardwood, but was hit or miss with things such as small bits of pet food or cat litter. And on the rugs? Forget it.  The DC33 has a knob on the frontal base of the vacuum that you can switch between "carpets/rugs" and "bare floors" with.  First of all, why in the HELL would you put it down *there* and not up on the handle like the other vacuums? Inconvenient, especially when, in my case, I have to switch back and forth quickly. Second, you must make sure that the vacuum is in the upright, locked position before switching that knob setting, or you risk stripping it and damaging the thing. "Turn on. Vacuum. Stop. Lock machine upright. Turn knob. Unlock and vacuum. Stop. Lock machine upright. Turn knob again. Unlock and vacuum." What a PITA.  Now, are you ready to vacuum the rugs? Have you stopped and turned the knob to the right setting? Don't get excited. Upon doing so and proceeding to try to vacuum, the brush roller takes a solid 3 to 5 minutes to realize it's on carpet, regardless of the fact that it's on the carpet setting. Here I am, pushing the damned thing with all my might across the carpet, and wondering, "Is it supposed to do this? Nothing is happening when I push it!" And upon pulling it back, there is bare-floor suction, not picking up anything from the rugs. Double check that the knob is in the right position. Yep, it is. Try to vacuum again. Nothing. Moved it off the carpet and onto the bare floor, and THEN the brush kicked in. Really??? Put it back on the rugs, and there is still resistance with pushing, and the brush roll intermittently disengages. Is it confused? Hell, we're ALL confused.  I used it exactly 4 times before deciding that this wasn't just a fluke, and that the machine really is a POS. I miss the Dyson DC17 Animal technology. That thing would suck a watermelon through a straw, on ALL surfaces.  If I could return this machine, I would, but my husband tossed the box prematurely. I mean, after all, it's a "Dyson", right? Meh. Now I'm stuck with a terrible machine that I'm just hoping I can clean up and sell for half of what I paid for it because Amazon won't accept a return without the original packaging.  My recommendation for you? Avoid this particular machine like the plague.
People READ THIS  I am suspicious about this.....I bought this vacuum few months ago, (especially likeing the dust wand and edge suction options) and looked on Amazon AFTER I purchased and it had a 2 star rating. (Which is when I knew I was in trouble) Now it has a 4 star rating? Anyway, someone complained about it loosing sucking power after a while......I assumed their filters were clogged, etc.....so after each time I used, I cleaned the vacuum filters GOOD. So wouldnt you know it, about 2 months later, it lost 90% of its suction power!!! What a POS. I will NEVER buy another Eureka product again. I bought a hoover, and it has been running strong. Go ahead, buy this product, but do not say I did not warn you. Mine went sailing into a dumpster, no joke. I only rate this item 1 star because I cannot deduct stars from it.
Buy a different brand  Absolutely terrible.  Bulky.  Loud. Difficult to carry up stairs.  Ordered a replacement since the first one arrived with a broken rubber piece and extremely loud...with whirring sound.  Received a replacement by amazon with instructions to somehow get the 1st back in the box to ship box....impossible to get handle off to fit back in box so had to attach a second box to it to send back. And found out the extension pieces were missing from the 1st order....talked to eureka twice.  They were absolutely no help....wish I purchased a shark or bissel
This is a cheap piece of garbage. The hose fell off constantly  You yet what you pay for. This is a cheap piece of garbage. The hose fell off constantly. Returned immediately.
Total disappointment  Put quite simply, it doesn't clean anything. I have to run it over the same spot 4-5 times to pick anything up. I finally gave up and bought a cheap vacuum from Home Depot and ran it behind the Dyson. It picked up all kinds of things the Dyson left behind. On top of that it's heavy, awkward, and the attachments are impossible to use. I have nothing good to say about it.
Good design, terrible performance  I so wanted to like this. Great design for small spaces, easy to use, empty and store. The too-short hose for accessories already covered in other reviews can be easily remedied by using an extension from other vacs.  Unfortunately, it doesn't clean well on any surface. My little Eureka Dust Buster clone on a stick with less than half the power and a third the cost, performs far better.  Dirt Devil Reps: Is this because of the auto-adjustment feature and is there any way I can tweak this? I will be happy to revise my review if you can help.
Not for Hand Scrapped Floora  Beware - this cleaner isn't effective on hand scrapped hardwood. I tried the unit out today and it would only clean the high ridges of my floors and not the low - the solution didn't even go into the low portions of my floor. I wanted to love this because my entire house is hardwood, but it just doesn't work with my particular floors. Ready to ship back.
Worst product ever!!!  I had this for 3 months and it broke down!!! I only used it for my living room in my 1 bed apartment!!!! I need my money back!
Lemons but great service  Came out of the box not working...have sent it back three (maybe four...have lost count) times!  This last time it caught fire!  Each time it was replaced with a "refurbished" model....This time we refused the refurbished trade and they are sending a new, different model.....
Not worth all the reasonable price  I just received the vacuum and used it on my kitchen floor.  I was shocked to see it didn't pick up the crumbs as good as I thought.  My 15-year old Hoover vacuum did a better job. It just kept pushing the crumbs and not picking them up.  I kept adjusting the height of the vacuum using the dial on the bottom which is extremely hard to do.  It took a lot of muscle to turn it.  Adjusting all the height differences made no change in its ability to pick up the crumbs.  It is also a very heavy vacuum and the placement of the cord is not well designed.  I kept having to move the cord so I wouldn't run over it , because it comes out from the bottom of the vacuum.  On a positive note, I loved the lift off and turbo brush to vacuum the stairs.  I thought that part did a great job, but overall I did not like it and returned it.
Heavy and awkward.
It Leaks!  So disappointed with this machine.  I received it less than a week ago & have used it twice. It cleans great, picks up the water, except for what it leaks!  I know for sure the dirty water tank leaks, because when I take it off to dump the water into the toilet I have to hold my hands under it otherwise it drips all over my laminate floors.  I also think the clean water tank leaks some as it's impossible to pick up all the water because of being a constant puddle.  I've even put a bucket near where I'm cleaning so I can keep emptying the dirty water tank, but feel if I keep doing this the cheap plastic clips that hold the top of the tank down won't last long. I purchased this intending to also use it on my laminate floors, but because of the leaks won't even try it.  Another complaint is the clean water trigger is hard on the fingers after using it a few times. Have looked up an authorized dealer & the closest one is almost 40 miles away!  I think I'm going to have to return it.
Look elsewhere, lots of problems and poor container design.  I do not usually tear down products, but I have to be honest on this one. First, the good. It has good suction. Now the bad. The cord doesn't autowind (the least of the bad), the containers gets clogged at the top where the hose comes in and does not settle to the bottle- so when you empty it, you have to take the whole assembly apart to the get the dirt out. Also, we've had it for two months, and now its making a terrible squeal sound. It seems one of the many filters was not sealing, allowing air through. So we got that fixed. I am bummed that Amazon recommended this. Look elsewhere and pay a bit more money for a better vacuum.
Do Not Get This If You Are Disabled!  this is Sophia, the one who uses the vacuum my sweet hubby of 20 years bought. i bought this in September, as i really wanted a Shark for my birthday. Big Mistake! ive had it 3 months, and it worthless! - the head is flat, and does not adjust. which means it is hard for some like me who is disabled to push. - i saw the long hose in the picture on the box, and all ads. the hose is short! - the suction on the head is so poor, when you walk across the cat's room, you can feel all the litter it didn't pick up! Ick! - the heads that are supposed to pick up pet hair, they don't work! - the hose makes a lot of noise, but the suction is very poor. - the cup for the dirt is small. i have to empty it more then twice, if i vacuum my whole house. - when vacuuming the head spits items out the back, right back onto the floor, just in a different place! What a waste of time and money, with a product that has false advertisement. now i am stuck with a poor product and unable to get my money back!
Unfortunately this only lasted 6-9 months before I had issues  I LOVED this vacuum when it arrived. I had purchased it to replace a vacuum that had died on me. I chose this vacuum because it was in expensive and I heard great things about it. The suction is amazing. It cleaned my carpets like no other vacuum I have owned before it. Even better than my moms first gen dyson. I have owned this vacuum since october 2014. it is now july 2015 and I am having issues with the motorized spinning brush. There is an option on this vacuum to either have just suction or to have the brush spin. when something is sucked up into the vacuum such as a cord, carpet, piece of clothing, etc....the brush will stop spinning so you don't burn the motor or the belt. now 9 months later when put in spin mode, the brush will spin for a second and then act as if something is caught in it and will not spin at all. I turn spin mode off and back on and it repeats the process. I have taken apart everything to cut any fibers wrapped around the brush and there is no reason the brush should not spin. In addition, it will spin occasionally but it is rare or it will spin after several minutes of having it turned on. I have since moved into a home with hardwoods and only need to utilize the vacuum for my outdoor rug. I use a brush attachment that has a spin brush on it that spins with suction. This will suffice for now since I don't use it often. Unfortunately it is easy to clog the attachment and have to clean it out constantly. For a vacuum that I have referred my mother to, and she bought herself one, and one that has gotten such great reviews, I sure did expect it to last more than 6-9 months. If I could I would return it.
I used to like vacuuming...  Now I am just annoyed with it. I agree with everyone else on this page who has had problems with this vacuum. I am amazed that I have the exact same problems! I wish I would have known all this before I bought it a year ago. Belts pop off, hose pops out while you're vacuuming, it's VERY noisy, it's VERY messy to empty the canister/filters (all that dust gets back into the air!), and the hard floor setting spits dirt back at you instead of sucking. I am very disappointed in this vacuum. Not what I would have expected from a Hoover. Probably the most annoying thing about this vacuum is the noise. I can't wait to find a vacuum that is QUIET and easy to maintain so vacuuming becomes fun again.
Doesn't work! Save your money. I bought it and in less than a minute of using it, I noticed a burning smell coming from it and the motor had burned up! I've tried to contact the company with no luck.
frustrated!!  So frustrated. I did all the research and settle on this vacuum. Seems like there isn't a great, reasonable vacuum on the market. But this was as close as it got. It arrived with the self-propel feature not working and smelled like burning rubber when I turned it on. Called Hoover. Got very poorly trained individual in customer service. Rude, unhelpful, took forever, not very polite. Said it was probably the belt and they would send me a replacement belt. Frankly I didn't want a brand new vacuum to require me to do a belt change. He admitted this is a common problem with the machine - why not fix the problem Hoover?? Hoover refused to send a new vacuum. So I decided to exchange the item for a new one from Amazon. I got the new one and it worked well.... for 1 day. Then the same issue happened with the belt. When it works, it works great. Love having the attached hand tools, but I need a vacuum to work for more than 1 day. I replaced the belts (sent for the initial vacuum). It was easy. But wondering how long this will last. Don't feel there is anything else that's that ideal vacuum in my price range.
Don't buy this!  This vacuum cleaner is junk! The dog hair clubs in the tube every time and never even makes it to the canister. I hate it and now have to purchase another one.
Too loud!  This was WAY too noisy. I did not feel it cleaned the floors well at all, on either setting. I had to go so slow to even feel like the floor was getting moderately clean, which meant even more suffering from the noise. I returned this and went back to my broom and steam mop for the tile.
item used  item was used, full of dirt, not packed properly, and no tools sent, nuff said, so sent it back. hurts amazon for my purchasing.  amazons fault, not hoovers, will purchase someplace else
Disappointing  Vacuum will not power on with first use
worst dyson  i have an older dyson and I love it. It is just a little to heavy for me to carry upstairs, so I got the dc65 which is lighter for downstairs. Suction is great. But the whole ball thing is annoying. It is not easy to maneuver and it hurts my wrist if I use it too long.  -It is awkward in trying to get under the kitchen cabinets and doesn't fit all the way under there. So I have to get out the hose. I don't like the "new" hose for various reasons I'll state in a bit.  -The "feet" on the ball get the cord wrapped around them and then it's just a mess. The handle won't latch, the cord is stuck and takes a bit to get it out.  -The vacuum won't stay upright either. It falls on me and it won't latch into place. You think it is latched because it clicks but it is not and then you go to use the hose and it falls on you and hurts you. No fun!  -The hose stays on ALL the time. It should shut off when it's in the closed position but it doesn't and that makes for an extremely loud vacuuming experience. Invest in some ear plugs if you still want this vacuum.  -my old attachments will not fit on this machine!!! I have a special attachment to get under furniture and well, I can't use it with this dyson. Truly annoying. My whole purpose in buying this new one was so that I have one upstairs and one downstairs so I don't have to lug the heavy one around. Well, now I'm back to square one since I cannot use the special attachment to get under my kitchen cabinets. I need it since the new dyson is not designed right to fit under there. Ugh.  Overall, I'm disappointed I wasted my money on this model. I will be taking it back. I'm sorry dyson, but you've changed and I'm no longer in love. :(
Definitely a "devil" of a vacuum - March 2015  I was really looking forward to getting to try out a small vacuum for quick pick up jobs around the house.  However, to say I am disappointed in this vacuum would be an understatement. First, the instructions are horrible and are actually more confusing than just putting it together and figuring it out on your own. For example, when trying to put the hose into the canister, the instructions do not tell you to squeeze the sides. Despite that, having 3 languages all squeezed onto one page is just frustrating to read - having to skip through the foreign sections to find where you need to continue reading.  Regarding the hose - trying to align the locking hole back is the most aggravating thing ever.  I bet I spent 10 minutes trying to get it to lock back on!  Other parts also do not click/lock together, they are just pushed together by force.  The vacuum is very loud, regardless if you put it on minimum or maximum.  The suction is pretty good but I found it quite difficult to move it across the carpet. You definitely get a good cardio workout trying to vacuum a room with this thing because is just does not roll well over anything, including a very low pile rug.  Another difficulty I encountered was retracting the cord; sometimes it worked great and other times it would just stick.  I did love the extension on the metal bar - what a cool feature and it was very easy to use.  I wish my regular vacuum had this feature! This particular model does not have he clip to allow you to have the hose to stand upright when not in use and the spinning option does not work consistently.  You cannot turn the spinning option off completely which likely will damage wood flooring. The multi-tool was a nice add-on and I found it quite useful on some drapes as well as some carpeted stairs.  Overall, I wanted to like the vacuum because it was small and lightweight but it just does not work as a full featured vacuum to handle my needs. I have found it quite useful for cleaning the car because it is so small and the attachment tool works great on the carpeting.  Nonetheless, if you are looking for a robust and easy to use vacuum, this one is unfortunately not it.
Dysfunctional Vacuum!  Just like K. Dixon, I had high hopes when purchasing this vacuum.  The Pet Turbobrush is a joke.  It's not motorized but runs on the suction.  I found it to be totally useless on low pile stair runner, the main reason I bought the vacuum.  My next mistake was going from a canister type to an upright.  This vacuum is heavy, cumbersome, and requires way too much maintenance to perform well.  All too frequent cleaning of the upper and lower tanks puts lots of dust and dirt in the air, and if you don't do it, it leaves dust balls on the carpet. Aggravation over poor performance pushed me to write this review!
do not buy this piece of crap vacuum. also don't buy a hoover, their customer service sucks  do not buy this vacuum. i bought this vacuum because i thought it would be high quality. i've gotten to use it three times. literally every time i use it, the belt drive for the self propelled function seizes and the belt melts to the inside of the vacuum. it's been to the repair shop twice and as soon as i get it back, the same problem happens again. I call Hoover customer service and they say to take it to the repair shop again. it can't be returned to Amazon and Hoover won't accept it for refund either. It's a piece of crap and I paid $163 for it. Complete waste of money.
Don't buy  Terrible piece of Hoover imitation of Dyson. Dyson is much better. I think I will take the vacuum and use it to catch the dust from my sanding machine after I clear out the clog of cat hair.
DO NOT BUY! Really cheap! Broke after couple uses!
after a few uses, the vacuum started spitting up HUGE clouds of dust and the whole room would have a  thick layer of dust in the air. I finally called the manufacture and they said they would replace it with an older model not even the same vacuum. After complaining further, they agreed to replace it with the same model but I still have to go through lot more loops to go through just to get a replacement. beautiful when it works but honestly there seems to be quite a few defective models that they are selling
Stopped working after 2 months  I loved it at first. it was amazing. Today just over 2 months later it won't turn on. Im so frustrated!!!!!
Ordered and delivered in January, not working by March. Will not purchase this again!
Poor quality  wand release on power head fails to lock extension 10 days after 2 year warranty expires, so now I have to either screw the extension into the handle or just use as a suction vac.  I guess 1 year of use would be horrible, 2 years is just very poor.  1st and last Electrolux.
This floor cleaner will not pick up water that has been dispensed. I have tried both Vacuum and Dry setting neither one will work properly  . When finished the floor look as if it hadn't been touched!
Worse Vacuum I ever bought-do not buy to use on bare floors or if you have dust allegies.  After 30 years of very hairy pets, even the cheapest vacuum from the Goodwill store did better, we have hard-wood floors and a large area rug. It cleans the area rug terribly and even though it says it is is friendly to hardwood floors on the box, it does not turn off the beater bar which results in the particles flying about, making the mess worse. It reminds me of an old 60's era Kirby trying to lug the thing upstairs. Also I have an allergy problem, so the idea of a side allergen filter was attractive, however in emptying the collection cup, which has to be done fairly often, a person end up touching and breathing the dust and having it end the air because you have to unclog the upper part. I can't wait until it dies so I can get a decent vacuum. If you have allergies, have someone else in your family take it outside to empty the canister.
Customer Service is horrible  Do not buy a Euro Pro product!!!!  We bought ours a year ago and up until a week ago I was relatively happy with it.  Then the belt broke on our suppossed "motorized spin brush".  My husband took the belt to several stores looking for a replacement, but no one carries Euro-Pro replacements, you have to buy them online and this thing is the biggest belt you've ever seen and doesn't match other products.  Good look finding the website though or a customer service number if you have misplaced your manual.  I had to email the wonderful people at HSN and ask them if they had a number.  They gave me the number and website.  We picked our belt on the website and put in for overnight delivery.  The package was 4 belts and 4 bulbs and they wanted to charge us $35.00 to ship it overnight in 4-6 weeks!  2 day shipping was an additional $20.00 for a $15 dollar, 2-3lb item!  So we called.  We got through easily enough but were then told that they would not lower shipping rates and wouldn't direct us to something comparable to our belt.  Then my husband told the lady that this was rediculous and she hung up on him.  If you can go 2 months without vaccuuming when this beast eventually breaks down and you have to order a spare part, this is the vaccuum for you.  As for me, I have a 1 1/2 yr old and have to vaccuum every morning.  I am going out to get a good old Hoover with replacement parts in most major stores!
Bought in August broke in december
Poorly designed  Excuse the pun, but this vacuum sucks.  The power of the unit is great, it picks up stuff really well, and the low design of the front of the unit is nice because it makes it easy to get under cupboards.  Whoever designed this unit for actual use must have never had to vacuum an entire house.  The power cord is too short.  With my previous vacuum I could clean every room in my house except one by only plugging in the unit once.  Now I have to plug and unplug the unit for every room.  The power cord also comes out from the bottom of the unit.  This means I'm either vacuuming over or tripping over the cord constantly.  If I hold on to the cord to try to avoid this, I'm having to work the cord back and forth in my hand all the time, a real annoyance.  The on/off switch is also located too low.  If you like to complain constantly while vacuuming, then this is the unit for you.  Otherwise, look elsewhere.
not so good  This item did not survive 40 minutes of use before the roller head stopped working. I have been unable to reset roller head safty device and missed the Amazon return window due to too many demands on my time, will have to check with Dyson warr for replacement parts.
PISSED OFF  I bought this not even a full year ago and it has fallen apart. Literally the plastic melted OFF! I'm pissed!
Not durable  I have this vacuum and it is now broken. The bearing that holds in the brush is made of plastic, it started vibrating causing a horrible noise. Eventually, the vibration caused the plastic brush to come out of place and literally melt from the friction of rotation. No worries though, you can buy a replacement brush for about $20 + $5 S&H, which comes to $25 on a $50 vacuum cleaner. Yeah right!  The F1 filters are very difficult to find in stores, although I found one at Target selling for $40, 80% of the cost of the whole vacuum cleaner! You can get them online, most places want to charge at least $20, but Amazon has them for around $8.  The vacuum does not do hardwood/tile floors, it is carpet only. It is quite noisy too, but that's probably expected for such a low price.  Not worth it since it breaks so easily and replacement parts are too expensive relative to the original low cost.
Broke too soon  Purchased in November, used in December, broken in February. Imagine there's a warranty but they make it so hard to pursue.
What a disappointment  This is our second Electrolux vacuum.  When we took the first one (a terrible vacuum) to a repairman, he contacted the company, and they sent us this as a replacement.  We were so excited...until we realized that it's awful too.  The suction in the attachments is nonexistent, and it's an overall disappointment.  We'll never buy another Electrolux.
Lost suction after a few months  Like many other reviewers, I found that the vacuum lost suction over time.  I'd say it only really worked well for a few of months, and now after 2 years the motor has gotten loud and has occasionally overheated.  Looking a number of the negative reviews, there seems a good chance that buyers of this vacuum will eventually have this problem.  Cleaning everything out seems to improve things slightly, but it is nothing like what it was when the vacuum was new.  Good things about the vacuum are the retractable cord, price, and features like the roller-off adjustment for hard floors.  The hose for attachments is quite short.
worst warranty ever  The only reason I bought this heavy and cumbersome vacuum is because of their 5 year warranty.  However,when I needed it, it turned out to be worthless. They cover the engine, and maybe some other parts, but they don't cover the parts that really cause you problems, like the hose. They say they do not cover damage to parts caused by using the vacuum. So if you are buying the vacuum cleaner in order to display it in your living room, or as an investment, fine, but just don't risk using it.  Also, be prepared to wait 15 minutes online to get a representative.
Disappointed  The vacuum is smaller than we expected.  The carpet cleaning attachment head is too small,  It takes too many back and forth strokes to cover the entire area.  Tough on shoulders.  Sorry I bought online instead of checking it out at a store.
A Huge Disappointment  My husband got sucked into the hype and came home with this machine about 5 years ago. We have two short hair cats, but no wall to wall carpet, just a few rugs. And our housekeeper brings her own vacuum so when I say it gets very little use, it really gets very little use. It worked fine for a few years and then as soon as the 2 year warranty expired we started to have problems. It just stopped picking up and would have a burning rubber smell when used. First they replaced the brush and it worked twice. Then they replaced the head and it worked another couple of times. The next time I brought it in for repair they did nothing because they said they couldn't find anything wrong. But it still wouldn't pick up anything off the rugs and still had these bad smells. During all of this my husband cared for it as if it were a collector car - cleaned it as advised, emptied it before it was full, never tried to vacuum up anything that it shouldn't be used for. Then it stopped working completely, just gave up and died. Needs a new motor and some other part. So we are done with Dyson, looking at a Miele which seems to have the best reviews. We are really, really disappointed with the performance of this very expensive machine and really disgusted with the Dyson repair facility. The only reason I gave it a second star is that it is a cool machine, the way it's built and is very easy to use. But if you buy one I recommend an extended warranty, preferably with a replacement option as it won't last. And let me reiterate - although we have had it for 5 years it got used 6 times a year, if that. for 15 minutes at a time.
00 Eureka picks up better but the Dyson keeps the dust from blowing back  It's a vacuum... Nothing to really write home about. I stuck my neck out and paid way too much for this. I bought it because I have two larfe dogs that shed. My $60.00 Eureka picks up better but the Dyson keeps the dust from blowing back. I keep hoping there's "something" I missed that makes it better. More than likely I'll give it to one of my kids and move on.
Purchased in November 2017 and in May the hose pulled out of the connector to vacuum. This is a cheap product. We took good care of it and did not pull it around by the hose. I would avoid this product.
bought this product because it said good for hardwood floors  bought this product because it said good for hardwood floors, i do not think it works well on my floors or rug. would not recommend this product.
Too many cons!  I purchased the DC25 2 weeks ago at Target. It was my first and last bagless. We have 2 heavy shedding dogs and this vacuum came highly recommended and reviews were awesome. I'm returning it tomorrow and going back to the Hoover Wind Tunnel.  Pros: Picks up VERY well.  Cons: Cord is way too short - long enough for one room only and my home is not large. Dog hair sticks to the containter and had to bang it against the trash can to get it out. Dust and hair then flew everywhere! No extension attachments to get under tables with.
worked good for about 4 months  worked well for about 4 months, except that it would sometimes stick and be hard to push handle down.  then the motor started to smoke and was unusable...will not get refurbished again.
Lasted a few weeks  Right off the bat I had to change the drive belt for the brush because the one that was on it was warped and burned in one spot. Within a few more weeks it stopped working again but I could not find a problem so I trashed it. Never buy Hoover again!
Ugh.  Don't buy it used/refurbished.  I ordered this as a refurbished/recon model.  In the description it advised that there might be 'cosmetic or packaging damage'.  More like several broken pieces and dumped into an oversized box.  It was promptly returned and I went to a local big box store to buy a Shark vacuum.
Buyer Beware - Double the defectiveness  I had this out of a box and put together within 10 minutes. I read the instructions and switched it on. I was vacuuming my living room carpet on the "high carpet" setting. Then the vacuum started smoking, smelled terrible and made a horrible sound. I took apart the bottom to inspect the belt and sure enough it was shredded so badly I couldn't even dig it out. I called the company and found out it was defective and quickly received a replacement.  Update: 1.5 years later and now the replacement I received is also now shredding the belts within 2-3 uses. Amazon will not refund nor replace it, because it's after 30 days. Eureka won't replace it or refund me my money despite the 2 year warranty. They've offered to "repair" it (again, for the 2nd time since I've owned it; the first time was because the belt actually quit turning the roller, but the repair shop couldn't find anything wrong with it!?) and I have declined because it's not worth my time and money to drive it the 20+ miles to a service center, nor my effort. I feel like this product is made cheaply. It should last a lot longer than 1.5 years. The customer service dept. at Eureka was horrible to deal with. They hung up on me twice.  I should have tried returning it months ago, but tried to deal with it to see if maybe I was just expecting too much. Clearly, expecting your vacuum to actually work is too much to ask from Eureka. Amazon, please think twice about carrying this horribly defective product.  Buyer beware - if you aren't planning on this being your daily, heavy usage vacuum or lasting you for 2+ years, DON'T BUY IT. We also owned a Eureka Boss prior to this for 10+ years, which worked great, but it eventually burnt out. It was built much better, the quality was much better. This newer version is half the vacuum the old one was. I'll never buy another Eureka again.
Fell apart on the 1st time cleaning and overheated.  I bought this vacum with the purpose of vacuming hard to reach areas( behind stereo equitpment, window blinds, and corner of the base molding). Upon intial use, the large vacuming attachement came apart at the connection, O ring attacthment. Also there is a glued on red felt strip on the underside, my guess to assist in the cleaning process. That came off too. When I went to place it back, I noticed some of the screws were loose. I tightened those up.  I used the brush attachement to vacum wall base edges, window seals and blinds. When I got to the second bedroom, the brush attachement had broke at the neck. At this point I was left with the slanted plastic corner attachement. As I went down the hall way, a wheel fell off.  I snapped the wheel back on, proceeded down the hallway then the vacum stopped working. I felt it, it was hot. About 30 minutes later it started back up. I cleaned it up and put it away back in the box it came in.  Again, my purpose in purchasing this item was to vacum areas where my large upright Hoover cannot reach. I don't have a large house, my carpet is berber. Not like I have heavy plush carpet for the attatchements to fall apart. I also clean my house every Saturday. Again, not like this vacum was working to hard to clean and overheat.  It does have great suction power but I guess it can only be used for lighter duties than I anticpated. I have since requested for a refund on this product from the seller. I do not want a replacement if it going to be made of the same thin plastic.
Pointless  Kind a useless pointless product it does it work good as a vacuumor a mop. its easier and quicker to use a  wet swiffer  Plus kept coming apart and the on off switch is by the sprayer so when sprsting  water I kept  turning the unit off
absolute garbage!!!  Don't waste your money and time to buy and then repackage and return - nothing more than a heavy, electric mop that does not do a job half as good as a $20 supermarket mop.  After receiving it I quickly unpacked, read the manual carefully and started using it.  Much to my disappointment while it made lots of vacuum like noises and suctions little else showed signs that it functioned according to its advertised glories namely scrubbed and cleaned.  Even worse, the solution packed with it STAINED my floors and subsequently STAINED my sink when I dumped it showing a white, filmy residue that required me to turn to car wax (that's right - car wax buffing) to remove it.  Absolutely garbage -  Hoover corporation you should be ashamed ... having owned a bunch of previous Hoover products over the years this will definitely be the very last one after all the aggravation it caused me and nearly ruined my floors and sink.
NOT for People with PETS!!!  If you have pets, I do not recommend this product.  The exhaust vent blows towards the front of the vacuum and actually blows the pet hair AWAY from the vacuum.  Cons:  * Cord is extremely short * Does not clean up against walls easily * V shape is really worthless because the V is so wide you cannot get close to the walls or around narrower spaces. * The attachment hose is extremely difficult to separate from the vacuum when you want to use attachments. * Suction is paltry * Vents to the front and blows hair and fine particles AWAY from the suction * Plastic does not seem durable  Pros:  * Great for taller people * Dirt resevoir easy to remove and quite spacious * Easy to maneuver * Wrap around cord mechanism very helpful and easy to use
Had it less than two months and it has stopped working.
A broom does a better job. Will be searching for a better vacuum.
Poor Product with poor service...a good chance of wasting your money  Have had this product since march 2014. It no longer works after limited and light work. The power button flashes and it just turns itself off. It is the very same problem as sooo many other who have been unfortunate enough to order this vacuum. Do not purchase this. The service is horrible and there is a very good chance the money you pay for this is as good as throwing it down a hole. If you already purchased this item...I wish you luck...
Not a happy purchase..  Not a good purchase. We planned to buy a small space saving but good Vacuum cleaner and we decided to purchase this one. It's nice looking, small saves space, you can adjust the height . Its easy to dump the dirt and clean the filter. But after a few days it stopped cleaning properly which is the main work of a vacuum cleaner. For cleaning a carpet floor you have to use it more than 1 time. Later the bottom roller stopped working also. So we ended up buying an expensive but good one and we are happy with our decision now.
The part that collects the dust and dirt is small, so it must be emptied several times in the course of vacuuming my house.  Also, it is difficult to fully empty the collection cup as the dirt gets stuck way up inside.  Would not recommend for someone who has pets as the fur is difficult to clean from the cup.
Totally overrated  The design of this vacuum is just wrong. With the canister and the motor in the detachable hand held piece, it is totally top heavy and won't stand up on its own. Essentially you are carrying all the weight in the handheld part. Because the bottom piece is so light, I had a hard time balancing the vacuum when I tried to use it. The bottom part is also so small, it takes forever to vacuum a small room. I hope they'll take it back.
I originally bought this vacuum to replace my Dyson Animal, which I had for years and which I LOVED. We did our research and this one was recommended by Consumer Reports and got decent enough reviews here that we decided to give it a shot. This vacuum isn't the easiest to steer around. It's awkward and it seems to have a mind of it's own when you are attempting to turn it (or even go straight at times). It also had a high pitched squeak noise when being used that never went away. Also, there are way too many filters that you have to remember to clean pretty regularly, or else the vacuum loses suction.  We had to send it back in to LG after owning it a few months because it lost all suction. I first called their customer service and spoke to someone who obviously wasn't a native English speaker. He was hard to understand and it seemed he was having difficulty expressing what he was trying to say in English as well. I finally had to hang up on him and call back and hope for someone else. The next Customer Service person spoke better English, but came with  less patience and was a bit "snarky" on the phone. We came to the conclusion that I had to mail the vacuum back to the manufacturer. They sent a box to pack it in and off it went. A month later, it comes back with a piece of paper in it showing how to clean the filters. All of which I had done before mailing it in to them. But it came back working (still with that horrible high pitched noise). Then it happened again. It stopped working. I emptied and cleaned every filter on that thing and it still didn't work. I had had it by that time. Done. Sent it to the dump. I would not recommend this vacuum.

Carpets beware!  Okay, so I waited a whole year to part with the $400 to buy a Dyson.  I was so excited when I finally got I home I had to try it right away. So I vacuumed the berber in my family room, which hadn't been done in 5 Days, looked in the canister after I was done and was not impressed: not much in there. Looked down at the vacuum and realized, Whoops, hadn't turned on the brush.  So I did that, went over the rug again and there was a lot more fuzz in the canister. But... here's the thing, that fluff comes at a price, because when I turned the vacuum over and looked at the brush I saw the hardest stiffest bristles I have ever seen in my life.  And that can not be good for a rug over time.  If you ever look at the bristles on other vacuums they feel soft, so they won't tear up the fibers on the rug. According to the manuel; you should turn the brush off when doing delicate carpets.  Well, aren't most carpets a bit delicate. Also, I compared the suction on the Dyson hose with the suction coming out of the hose of my 9 year old Kenmore canister.  The old Kenmore had superior suction. The Dyson can also be a bit hard to push on plush carpet. So after 2 days, I returned my Dyson.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars, was that it is very good on hard floors ,but I don't have enough of those in my house to justify keeping a $400 vacuum.
Great product . As long as you realize you canmot get the filters for this .  I love this vacuum , it's has great suction !! The only problem amazon shows this with the wrong filter (f12), it uses f62 !!!!! I bought this vac and 4  f2 filters , which don't fit. I have been looking for the f62 filters everywhere. I called dirt devil and they are out of stock until July . It's the end of April and I know my filer will not last that long . Kinda wish I did not buy this vacuum .... the reason the filters won't be available to order is because they are coming from CHINA. Dirt devil won't even let you order them now, and get them in july when they come in!!! I don't think I want to buy any more dirt devil products even though this is a good vacuum, it is just not worth the hassle of not being able to filters.  ok, I found the filter at vacpartswarehouse. The cost of two was 19.79 with taxes and shipping. They have f62 filters here on Amazon, after weeks of searching I finally found it. It's cheaper to order at vac parts warehouse! I just wish Amazon had it shown with the right vacuum :(  I would give it more stars because it is a great product, only two stars because of the wrong info about the filter....
Only got 2 months out of it  This vacuum worked great when it worked. Gets within 1/2" of the wall, adjustable height. However, after 2 months it stopped working in the middle of vacuuming. No power, no worky. Really disappointed.
worked well-- and broke fast  I got this in July and really liked it-- lightweight, moved well, worked well.  But after about a month it started shorting out, and now it runs for a minute or two and then stops over and over again.  There's no service center as far as I can tell in Manhattan, so I'd have to take it an hour on the subway to get it fixed.
Assembly was easy also. However  The 1st few months the vacuum worked lovely. Assembly was easy also.  However, vacuum over heats often. I had for about 10 months and now it doesn't pick up anything even after cleaning the filter. Currently browsing for a new vacuum to purchase.
Not as stated  Just received this and strongly suspect this is not "band new" and it is certainly not in "Factory sealed box".  As listed on packing list.  This looks as it if is an "insurance salvaged item".  I suspect this vendor of deliberate and dishonest practice.  Waiting to hear back from vendor before opening this item to check the serial number etc.
Junk  Circuit board died twice in 3 months.  Do not buy this piece of junk.  Repair man says he sees a lot of these,  and this is a rural area.
18 months later ......  The vacuum was okay, but I wasn't as happy with it as I expected to be.  Now 18 months after purchasing it it has stopped working but has a 3 year warranty so I'm working to see what Hoover can do for me. I had the hardest time finding the serial # only to find it had been blacked out on the manufacturer label.  It was shipped by and shows to be an Amazon LLC item but the fact that the serial # was blacked out leaves me feeling uncomfortable about where this item is coming from.  The item doesn't deserve the hype it gets and the blacked out serial # seems quite fishy.
Very poor suction.
no good
BUY A BETTER BRAND!  Cheaply made - button that rises and lowers the head broke after just a couple of uses.  Upon calling Bissell for assistance to get a part, I got the usual help that can barely speak English and needless to say never got a part.  I'm not even sure if the person even understood what part I was trying to tell them that broke.  Between the hold time and the language barrier, its certainly not worth the time.  BUY A BETTER BRAND!
What a peice of junk- belt constantly breaks  Do not buy!!! Belt constantly breaks. And they must know that because they send you an extra belt with it. First belt lasted about 2 months. It breaks on average about every three months. Putting a new one on is not a major engineering feat but is a hassle. Also, I am not an expert on vacuums but I just assumed all vacuums are bag-less these days. I did not even think a company would make a vacuum that requires a bag but this one does. I think it would be like buying a TV and finding out it is not a color TV.I just assumed these days all vacuums would be bag-less. The vacuum is heavy and bulky. There is no place to attach the accessories to the vacuum. I am a single guy with no pets. I vacuum about twice a month. This vacuum is not working hard at all. I am afraid to think if it was my mom's vacuum who vacuums everyday how often the belt would break. Complete piece of junk. Major mistake in buying this.
Junk is an Understatement  Not worth it,  Cons: >It has a fan that blows away all the small visible dirt before the brush can get to it. >Poured some scented powder on my carpet and it couldn't suck it in. >on the mid size dirt, this vacuum will easily get clogged >to empty the dirt can, very narrow opening and leaves a mess around  Pros: >Very light weight.
Assembled incorrectly  I'm so disappointed that this product doesn't work correctly. I was looking for a small vacuum for my NYC apartment before my move and the stick was assembled backwards :( I realized it after the return window was closed. It would be such an amazing product if it was correct.  Just realized
Do not buy this vacuum.  I bought this as a gift for my mother. She was not pleased with it. It was a defective vacuum. She couldn't push it across the floor. It also arrived two days late! I am a very disgruntled shopper. I know I don't pay for my Prime membership with free two-day shipping for something to arrive late AND defective.
Learn about their extremely poor service record!  I wished I had read alot more about the Dyson company before I wasted 400.00 on this vacuum. I honestly thought that a 5 year warranty and the amount of money spen was going to get me an excellent vacuum I would have for years. I was so wrong! First of all, it does consistantly have on/off button issues. I have had mine 9 months and the beater brush stopped working. Husband called Dyson and they won't send out part, you must get it fixed at a dealer they choose or send it to them. We sent it to them and it has been over a month now and it's still not back! I have read many complaints with the same problems. Their website says 7-10 days to fix and that is a blatant lie. They do not answer emails. I called 2 weeks into the repair and was told they were looking for a part and to give it one more week and I would "for sure be getting it back by then." I never heard, so I called and then was told I needed to give them one more week cause the part never came in, and again I would "for sure" be called with a tracking number. They never called. I called them again and was told I was put at the "front of the line" and the part would be arriving tomorrow and I was going to get a call. Never got a call so I called. Today I am told, the vacuum is fixed but the company had not put the tracking number in the system yet so I needed to wait until tomorrow to get the number. Do I believe them? No. Like I said, please learn about their poor record. I have read many cases just like mine from America and Europe and some are as old as 3 years. This means they are well aware they have service issues and Mr Dyson would rather have the money than fix his poor service problems. DISGUSTING! I order tons of items off the internet all the time. I have never in my life run into a company that had such poor poor service as this. I would never recommend ANYONE to buy from them. Yes the vacuum sucks, BUT it DOES lose suction, so he lies. The buttons work at their own choosing and the beater brush stopping to work is a MAJOR issue from all I have learned. The 5 yerar warranty is worthless because the service is ridiculous. I hope I can spare someone the pain. Oh and I would recommend the Hoover Wind Tunnel. I borrowed my friends and it sucked alot out of my carpet I presumed the Dyson was getting and it has all the same technology. She paid 160.00 for her Hoover. Don't spend your money. Seriously, I wish I had been warned.
does not pick up  does not pick up
complete waste of money  I wish I had done more research.  I thought for $400 and a 5 year warranty I was making a good investment.  Wrong.  It was always difficult to move into the reclined position and after a few months, it broke altogether -- twice losing suction in the head.  The (cheap) plastic key that switches the to the bottom head when you recline it does not snap the hose into place correctly.  Twice I've traveled for almost an hour each way to their authorized dealers, to have them claim, weeks later, to be "fixed," only to have the exact same problem come up a couple of weeks later.  Since it was clear that I had a bad unit, I asked for a replacement.  Dyson's only solution is for me to package it up, drive to UPS, send it off to their repair center and wait another several weeks for them to repair it.  Only after I have 2 more break-downs with their center doing the repairs, will give me a new one.  More annoying, when I call the help line, the personnel insists I disassemble it to check for blockage when I can see with my own eyes the problem --  the key piece hasn't snapped the connection hose into place.  I've already wasted several hours on the phone and driving back and forth to repair shops.  I'm done.  I am throwing away a $400 vacuum that I have owned 1 year.  That's how bad the product and service is.  Ironically, at the same time, my friend bought a $70 dollar Eureka.  Works like a champ.  Not a single problem.
OH NO No power
Bissell 35931 Not so great  I am not all that happy with the Bissell 35931. The actual vacuum to me, hasn't any umph or power. It does alright vacuuming low carpet, but regular carpet, forget it! And hardwood floors or linoleum, you better be wearing shoes. Because if you are bare foot, your feet will have a nice loofa scrub from the back fire. As for the hose, the suction is awful and hardly picks up a thing. You have to be right on top of the object to pick it up. And the hose does not come with an upholstery attachment. Not worth the money. I am returning my 35931. Thank You.
Dont waste your money  Second time using it and it stops working and won't suck anything up. Complete waste of money!
not good with pet hair  I got this vacuum as a gift from my mother becuase our old one was dead. I only use it on 1 rug and in 1 room as the rest fo the house is tiled or has wood floors. I wish I could use it on hard floors, but all the dirt shoots out the back and I have to sweep anyway. I have 3 dogs that shed alot and ususally sweep all the time. I have maybe used this vacuum 3 times since getting it and everytime I have to take it apart (unscrew the hoses, etc) to unclog it. Even after removing clogs, the suction is awful. If you have pets, I would NOT reccomend this vacuum. Mine came with a pet hair remover brush that is supposed to spin, but the suction is so bad it won't even turn with a little push. Hope I can return it...
Does not Work!!!  This was my second Eureka Pet Lover - my first one was amazing and lasted my about 2 years (daily use with a super shedding dog) This one does not suck up anything at all. I have tried to take it apart and clean it out several times and I can't get it to work!! Please Eureka/Amazon - reach out to me and fix this!! I need a vacuum!!!
Why is this not an attachment option to a DC44?  I glanced through all the reviews and I didn't seem to see anyone too bothered by one glaring issue!  Reviewer, Amazoned, mentioned it in his/her review under side note #2 but I feel that this is such a problem that it warrants its own review entry.  The head of this unit should also be available as an attachment to an existing DC44!  What's the point of having two battery powered suction units that are essentially the same? I physically inspected this at a local store and verified that you cannot just take the head and attach it to either a DC44 or a DC35.  The external physical dimensions at the attachment point are compatible but internally they are not compatible.  So the DC44 includes power contacts that get in the way but couldn't there have simply been a collar connector piece like the standard dyson hard floor tool?  In the DC35, it's almost even more insulting.  The physical dimensions of the tube are perfectly matched -- internal AND external!  The only thing preventing you from connecting them is a small ridge.  I'm almost tempted to sand it down and connect it anyway if I had a DC35.  So this morning, I'm watching an informercial for the Shark Rocket what do I see?  An attachment called the Dust Away that resembles the Dyson Hard's head!  For those who don't know, the Shark Rocket is Shark's attempt to copy a DC44.  While it may have is glaring weaknesses, (extra weight and a long power cord .. for some, this may actually be a plus) they were smart enough to make the Dust Away a simple attachment rather than to thinly disguise what seems to be an attempt to grab extra revenue by forcing the purchase of an entirely new unit.  Why even make the "Hard" attachment detachable if that's the case?
Not For Heavy Duty Use  I've use the FloorMate for a few months now on my tiled kitchen floor. At first I had to find a reliable cleaning agent that wouldn't leave streaks. Once I got a good cleaning agent, it performed very well on about 5 jobs. After that, I noticed that the vacuum suction had declined. It wouldn't pick up anything in those grout areas of the floor. After closely inspecting the seals around the trash canister, I noticed that they were made of a very cheap material that quickly wears down from just removing and replacing the canister. That also leads to less water pickup when in the cleaning mode as well. The FloorMate never did a great job with drying, even when I went extremely slow over the whole floor. This wasn't a great buy for me and I'm already back on the market for a solution.
Had lot's of Sharks and this one is a minus 10.
The Boss is squeeky and irritating to use  I bought this vacuum because Consumer Reports tagged it a "best buy"  Well, not for me. I hated the way it's made. It squeeks when you push it, it's hard to use the attachments and is clumsy and heavy to use. The switch that stops the beater bar for hard floor cleaning is on the bottom of the unit, but you have to bend over and switch it by hand, you can't use your foot. And the switch is hard to move, I thought it wasn't working, but I just hadn't pushed it hard enough. It hurt my fingers. It may really clean the floor well, but it sure is a pain in the #@$% to use.
Eye Vac review  Very disappointed in this. First of all, it is LOUD. It scares my kids and pets. Second, I don't think the "sucker" works that great. I don't see a difference between using this or just plugging in my vacuum and using the hose attachment. Actually, my vacuum is more quiet than this.  I guess if you only have hardwood or tile and no need for a vacuum then this is an ok alternative. Also, I didn't know until after I purchased that it doesn't work great with black bristled brooms. My fault for not reading reviews before buying, but I really don't want to buy a new light-colored broom for this purpose. But perhaps the "sucker" would improve with the lighter bristles. Overall, I wish I kept the box so I could return this because it's just going to sit in my closet until I feel an appropriate amount of time has passed before I can officially kick it to the curb.
My expectations were too high for this price.  Very small vacuum with a very short cord.  Parts are very flimsy plastic and it doesn't have a hard floor option.  On the plus side it does have great suction.  For a super small carpeted area it would be fine.
dyson vacuum cleaner  I received product.  It was broken. I had it returned.  I had requested a replacement. And your company never replaced it.  So I don't know if I should buy  a different one or wait to see if you will replace. Item seemed to be as advertised, but I didn't actually use it. It was a Remanufactured Dyson DC07 All-Floors Cyclone Upright Vacuum Cleaner, Lavender
Worst vacuum. It loses suction all the time  Worst vacuum. It loses suction all the time, we've called and complained twice now about the issues. Should have bought another dyson
low suction/performance.  loses suction, fresh bag refill and all, otherwise it was nice but not for the price, bought a shark rotator pro, and ran it after this vacuum, picked up almost a half a canister from what this missed and it was cheaper. save your money this vacuum does not perform dollar for dollar against the competition. also the hinge for the upright lock loosens and never stands up on its own agains the weight of the hose....very annoying for storage. I only use this for my basement carpet now as it is low carpet and doesnt trap dirt like my hight traffic area with nice carpet.
Worst service and support!  We bought this vacuum cleaner based on the positive reviews in Consumer Reports in October, 2014.  In the first five minutes, it chewed up both belts that  came with it.  We were instructed to take it to a service center for warranty work.  I took them over three weeks to finally fix the machine.  The repair service replaced a bunch of parts but nothing was solving the problem.  The motor finally had to be replaced.  When we got it back home, upon starting up the vacuum it started to smell like burning rubber and the beater bar would not turn.  I called Eureka Service once again, this time requesting a replacement since this obviously was a lemon.  They said they had to speak with the warranty department.  They said the warranty department denied the replacement saying that I had to return it to the service center who would, in turn, apply for a replacement if it could not be fixed.  I told them this was unacceptable to which they replied that was their process and would not agree to anything else.  I told them I would return this to Amazon and purchase a different vacuum cleaner.  They said that was fine.  Obviously they do not care about their customers.  Of course, it took so long for the "repair" that the time has expired for me to be able to return this to Amazon.  I will not purchase another item from Eureka.  Buyer beware!
Disappointed...  This was the second Eureka vacuum I had purchased, I bought this one because it had the Power Paw. However, the Power Paw stalls out and does not work well when it comes to cleaning furniture and such. I would not have purchased this vacuum again...I would have purchased a different brand that had power when using the attachments. Very disappointed.
terrible vacuum
Hoover U6485900 Windtunnel Anniversary Vacuum  I purchased this vacuum at the insistance of the salesman at Best Buy.  As I was speaking to the salesman, another customer had already picked up the vacuum box, raving about the reviews he just read on this vacuum.  Please do yourself a favor and don't buy this vacuum, unless you like aerobic exercise. Although it has incredible suction, the attachments fly off and I am constantly having to bend down and pick them up.  Many times they flew under the bed and tables, which is very, very annoying.  I have had flea problems and have to vacuum daily so I know how expensive the bags are (have to use one every day and then trash it immediately), and how inconvenient it is to have attachments that fly off the vacuum.  If I could, I would get rid of this crappy vacuum today in favor of a Dyson, which has a 5 year warranty.  I had a Hoover for 26 years and it was great, but this Wind Tunnel is a nightmare...pass it up or get a lot of exercise
terrible customer service from Hoover  I purchased the UH 50000, and when it arrived, it was missing the plastic cover which secures the pet hair attachment to the cleaner.  I contacted Hoover about this, and they replied saying that "because of customer feedback, this cover is no longer supplied with this vacuum."  And they were "sorry" for any inconvenience this caused me.  So beware of that, if you order this particular vacuum.  It does work OK, but I'm still unhappy about the fact that I have to carry the attachment with me when I want to use it, as there's no storage place on the cleaner.  I would have expected better from an established name like Hoover.
Hearth Country Ash Vacuum  I received this small ash vacuum with the purchase of my new pellet stove.  I used it a couple of times with no problem.  The third time, the motor overheated and it stopped working.  I put my hand on top of the vacuum and the motor was very hot to the touch.  I thought I had probably burnt the motor only after very little use of this new vacuum.  I disassembled the vacuum, not the motor, and cleaned out the filter and the canister.  Put it back together and let cool for week or so.  The next time I tried to use it, at least it started.  Not long after, the motor again started to get very hot.  I used the little plunger that is suppose to free ashes from the filter, but it doesn't.  I put it aside and cleaned my pellet stove with my regular shop vac.  My shop vac had a lot more suction than this ash vac.  Disappointed in the product, I just stored it out of the way to collect dust and probably throw it out some day.  Lucky I got it for free with my pellet stove.  I highly recommend that people don't buy this ash vac.
Garbage  Here's a what I don't like about this vacuum: 1) you can't turn off the rotating brush; that makes it impossible to use on hard floors, unless you wear ear plugs; if you set the brush for high carpet, the noise will drop but you won't clean anything either. Also it has a tendency to grab cables which happen to be nearby. 2) it's insanely noisy. If you live in a condo, all your neighbors will enjoy the sound. 3) it's suction power is fairly weak 4) if you need to reach high above cabinets and fridge to vacuum the dust, this vacuum cleaner is not the tool 5) the power cord constantly gets under the vacuum brush; you have to hold it in your hand to avoid this. Or you can try vacuuming without a back and forth motion of the vacuum.  So save your money and buy something else. This is a waste. It's a low end useless tool.
I Would Pass On This Vacuum  <div id="video-block-R1U4WYQQXMS262" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1bEWmnn3ES.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91UGG9lsEBS.png" class="video-slate-img-url">Let me first qualify that I hate cleaning and I know next to nothing about vacuums.  I know they are supposed to pick up dirt and debris from the floor and if a vacuum does that, I cannot ask for more.  My wife and I got the vacuum and took it out of the box.  We were quite pleased that assembly was quite simple.  Compared to our Kirby Sentria, the Dirt Devil Vision series is much lighter and easier to handle.  Unfortunately, that is about the only thing good I found about this vacuum.  The first thing I found that I did not like was that the button to turn on the vacuum is on the body of the unit and the switch to turn on the brush in the vacuum head is on the handle.  I have used canister type vacuums in the past (Kenmore brand) and I very much prefer being able to control the vacuum from a single switch in the handle as opposed to two separate switches like the Dirt Devil Vision does.  The next thing I did not like was the cord length.  The cord measures in at roughly 17 feet long.  This allows me to vacuum roughly one room and not much more.  I like vacuums with a longer cord length so that I can get a room done and a good chunk of hallway before having to unplug and move to the next outlet.  The cord on the Kirby vacuum we normally use measures in at about 30 feet.  Perhaps I am a bit spoiled by the Kirby, but it definitely felt I was constantly moving the plug with the Dirt Devil Vision.  In my home, besides myself and a short haired dog, we have 4 females with hair on the longer side.  After a few short uses, I could not help but notice the massive amount if hair that has become entangled in the brush of the vacuum.  From what I can tell, the brush assembly is not easily disassembled on this vacuum.  I have not read the manual yet to see if there are directions on cleaning the brush.  Maybe I will be pleasantly surprised, but I doubt it.  Finally, in my opinion, the Dirt Devil Vision just does not clean well.  I uploaded a video where I performed a side by side test of the Dirt Devil Vision versus the Kirby Sentria.  One might argue I am comparing the Ford Fiesta with a Lincoln MKS, and I would not disagree.  However, I am not testing the bells and whistles of each model, I am just testing how well they pick up dirt and debris.  As the video shows, the Dirt Devil just does not do a good job.  Given how easily the Dirt Devil Vision clogs with longer hair and how poorly the vacuum cleans, I cannot recommend that people spend their hard earned money on this product.  If you cannot afford a nicer vacuum or if you are buying it for a place where it will not see much use (like a vacation home), then this vacuum might be OK.  However, I would recommend spending a few more dollars and buying something better.
Hunk of Junk  The last Dirt Devil I had was great.  Lasted over seven years.  I bought this Dirt Devil for my mom based on how the last one worked (different model, though).  This thing is a joke.  It is the most preposterous design I've ever seen.  It picks dirt up from point A and leaves it on point B.  It kicks up and spits out dust and is just generally worthless.  You see how that tube wraps around the handle?  That's the route the dirt has to take.  It's sucked in from the side of the base, then it goes up and around that tube and some of it ends up in the bagless container.  Dirt Devil should recall every one of these things, because I know DD makes good vacuums, but this isn't one of them.  You know those crappy little gadgets that annoying people sell on late night TV?  That's what this thing is.  Sounds good.  Dirt cheap.  Total hunk of junk.
2nd time buying , and it breaks . Not sure whats wrong with this product .
Had to return 2 of them because they wouldn't stand upright.
wasn't as advertised. charged me $30 to return.  Ad said auto rewind cord but it wasn't. Returning it cost me $30.  Complete ripoff.
Cleans well, but very unstable.  I did a lot of research and purchased this vacuum based on other reviews.  I have four furry pets and am constantly battling the fur in the carpet and on our upholstery.  It is GREAT at vacuuming up pet hair and it gets tons of dirt out of the carpet.  BUT, it falls over all of the time!  Any time I use the wand and attachments the main vacuum falls over even when I am only a few feet away.  The hose is a joke.  It is short and only stretches out a few feet before it pulls the vacuum cleaner over.  SO ANNOYING!!  I'm constantly having to brace the vacuum next to a piece of furniture before using the wand/hose.
not for household use with long haired critters  To begin with the suction was unbelievable.  After three uses, it wouldn't pick up anything.  Cleaned out what I thought was the entire belly.  However, it was blocked beyond what my tools could reach.  Decided since I wasn't going to do this each and every time I vacuumed, I would have to return in.
VACUUM BABIES  I'VE HAD THIS DANG VACUUM FOR OVER A YEAR WHICH WAS ENOUGH TIME TO HAVE SEVERAL VACUUM BABIES WITH IT WHICH WE HAD AT THE START BECAUSE IT WORKED SO WELL AND WAS SO GOOD AT CLEANING THAT I EVEN BOUGHT ONE FOR MY EX WIFE NOT THAT SHE APPRECIATED IT BECAUSE SHE'S NOT ALWAYS VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE NICE THINGS PEOPLE DO FOR HER LIKE BUYING THEM A NEW VACUUM JUST BECAUSE YOU LIKED IT AND HAD SOME VACUUM BABIES WITH IT WHICH WERE SORT OF LIKE A FULL SIZED VACUUM BUT SMALLER (BECAUSE THEY'RE BABIES, SILLY).  IN ANY EVENT THIS VACUUM WAS COOL FOR A WHILE THEN THE GDAMN LEFT WHEEL STARTED TO FALL OFF LIKE THE BLOOM FELL OFF OUR RELATIONSHIP SO I GOT SOME SUPERGLUE OUT TO TRY TO KEEP THE WHEEL AND OUR RELATIONSHIP TOGETHER BUT JUST TODAY THE WHEEL FELL OFF AGAIN LIKE THE WHEELS FALLING OFF OUR RELATION SHIP AND I SAID GDAMN IT AGAIN BECAUSE NOW I WAS REMINDED OF THE FLEETING NATURE OF RELATIONSHIPS, WHETHER WITH VACUUMS OR WITH EX WIVES AND HOW EVEN IF YOU'VE HAD VACUUM OR REGULAR BABIES WITH THEM YOU STILL CAN'T ALWAYS KEEP THINGS TOGETHER EVEN IF YOU USE SUPERGLUE.  ANYWAY I'M OFF PAROLE NOW AFTER THE SUPERGLUE INCIDENT  (THE ONE WITH MY EX WIFE, NOT THE ONE WITH MY VACUUM) SO NOW I'M SINGLE AND READY TO MINGLE AS THEY SAY SO IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN A SLIGHTLY PUDGY GUY WITH A COOL BEARD WHO LIKES TO TYPE IN ALL CAPS THEN YOU SHOULD HIT ME UP AS THEY DAY BUT PLEASE DON'T RIGHT TO ME IF YOU HATE VACUUM BABIES CAUSE I'VE NOW GOT SEVERAL THAT NEED A FATHER'S LOVE.  ANYWAY I'M ALSO INTERESTED IN ANY RECOMMENDATIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE IN THE WAY OF CORDLESS VACUUMS BECAUSE LIKE I SAID THE WHEELS FELL OFF MY LAST ONE.  GOD BLESS YOU MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS OF THE INTERTUBES!!!
HEPA filter is a joke  Apparently you can't trust Eureka/Electrolux not to hide behind special brand terminology & marketing tricks. The HEPA filter on this vacuum is basically useless, as other reviewers have stated, because the vacuum's exhaust isn't entirely forced through the filter....there are other exhaust vents that aren't filtered, and thus their claim of filtering 99.7% of all particles is a lie. It only filters 99.7% of the particles that happen to get blown through the filter......100% of the rest of the particles get blown through the other unfiltered vents. Ridiculous!  Apparently, if you want to get true HEPA filtration from Eureka, you have to buy a model with "Sealed HEPA Filtration", which is Eurekese for "actually filters all vacuum exhaust through the HEPA filter rather than just some of it". This is a very important distinction to make for people with allergies, respiratory problems, or someone who's specifically purchasing the vacuum for DIY mold remediation/cleanup (aka me).
DO NOT BUY!  Three months after we purchased our Hoover Cyclonic, it burned and ripped our bathroom floor up when I used the hand tools.  I called Hoover customer service and their response was that this can happen and tough luck.  I will never buy a Hoover again!!!
Waste of Money!!  This vacuum is not worth the money! I've had it about 6 mos and it's lost so much suction! My last Eureka I had lasted me 4 years. This one is AWFUL! Do not buy!
Sorry, but it's not worth the hype!  I purchased the Dyson DC25 about 6 months ago.  While the roller ball technology works great on bare floors, on carpets with any pile at all it's actually a hindrance.  The beater bar, when running also makes the vacuum difficult to maneuver on carpets.  It is not a horrible vacuum cleaner (and yes, let's not forget it is still just a vacuum cleaner), but it is certainly not worth all of the hype.  The laws of physics remain in place: when you create a vacuum by suctioning the air out of a chamber, the holes are going to get plugged up eventually.  I had a Kenmore cannister vacuum for 8 years that worked every bit as well as this thing and it is roughly the same price.  The attachments that come with the DC 25 are a joke.  The hose is unwieldy because it is too rigid and too short.  The upholstery tool has no ventilation holes, so it basically just sucks down on the upholstery and pushes stuff around.  Another basic principle of physics.  I'm glad that some of you found it to be a great machine.  I think it's an overhyped big piece of plastic.
Faulty Design Dyson DC25  Beware! If you buy the Dyson 25, the hose is too small. It doesn't reach anything beyond a very short distance and then the clip breaks and we are left waiting for 10 days each time while it is fixed. They offered to send the replacement part to our home but we don't want the trouble of fixing it ourselves. It should not even break in the first place. We purchased our Dyson in September 2009 and have already taken it in twice for repairs. I called their customer service in Chicago and got a very bad attitude from 3 service agents who said Dyson doesn't make the hose - only the unit. I wrote an email to their head office and got a call from a man who said Dyson does not manufacture the hose (repeated speech). Dyson clearly doesn't take responsibility for any part or care about full customer satisfaction. Be careful if you buy this vacuum and need customer service. The design of the hose and clip is shoddy, not sturdy enough to clean our house, has insufficient length, and for a high priced product like this with a lot PR, we expected a quality durable product that would last many years without any problems. Once the warranty runs out on this product they won't repair it any more so we feel we are going to get adequate return on investment. Unless Dyson does right by us by refunding our money we will leave this feedback here (they told us they won't repace the machine or give a full refund).
Didn't work.
Kirby sentria vac  We bought one of these a few years ago and it has been a piece of junk. Eats belts. Head constantly freezes up. Have had it serviced many times by service center. Durability is not what it used to be. DONT BUY ONE OF THESE!!!! ITS NOT WORTH THE MONEY....unless you want to constantly fix it before you use it.
Don't buy it!!!!  Terrible!! Wanted to return but was two days late. I am so upset that I spent that kind of money on a product that wasn't worthy of it!. It makes noises and doesn't clean like I thought it would. I would throw it out but too much money was spent on it. Very bummed!! Really who wants to clean but we do and spend this kind of money to make it easier and doesn't,is very upsetting!!
Hoover products are usually terrific-but not this  The upright is simple, lightweight and really seems to pick up the dog fur. Some said it is loud but I don't agree. It's not exactly quiet but I have yet to use a quiet vac. I have owned Hoover's for many years. My last Hoover was the wind tunnel. I loved the on board hose, self propel but... it was so heavy, and the self propel gave out and it was like pushing an army tank -okay a small car around. So I opted for a lighter weight bagged vaccume and the canister. HATE the canister. LOUD, air output at hip level, it blows things around, outside  body cover gets heated up and laying against your body, you cannot sit it on the floor as it is too unstable to stay upright. And carrying the thing-(light weight) but very cumbersome and slips off shoulders, or you hold yourself in a weird position and end up with back ache. I have to use vaccume hoses. I have 3 dogs. I vac, curtain tops, lampshades, furniture and little nook and crannies. I cant say the suction is all that terrific in this cumbersome little beast either. So not a fan of this canister. I should have gotten another wind tunnel. But will have to live with this purchase for awhile.  Update... It's been a couple months now. I have to say I am more disappointed in this vaccume. It let's oders go throughout the house. Cloth outer does not contain them like the hard shell models. So I would NOT reccomend this vaccume to pet owners. Plus it does not adjust over different floor levels. I thouhgt I could live with this vaccume for awhile but I cannot. I have taken away a star as well. I am going to a hard shell vaccume with the onboard hose etc. Perhaps a Kemore.
I am disappointed in you Electrolux  I am disappointed in you Electrolux! I use to think it is a brad with quality but since the vacumn I have not purchased anything from this brand.  I purchased the item from costco. Vacuum is heavy and bulky so I thought its sturdy, boy was I wrong! It worked for only for couple of months and the vacuum would not even pick up a strand of hair.  I tried cleaned the vacuum, tube, everything etc... To fix the problem but no use.  Please do not buy!  My 50 dollar Kenmore works better thank this... I was so disappointed !
NO SUCTION MONSTER  I ORDERED THIS WITH HIGH HOPES THAT IT WOULD BE POWERFUL SUCTION, IT WOULD NOT EVEN PICK UP PAPER FROM THE FLOOR, IT WOULD NOT HOLD THE ATTACHMENTS IN PLACE AT ALL. DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT, I ORDERED THIS FROM THE TV, WHAT A MISTAKE THIS WAS, AS SOON AS I ORDERED IT, WE SAW IT AVERTISED ON SALE AT THE LOCAL DEPARTENT STORES FOR $150.00. I PAID $200.00 FOR IT.  WHAT A RIP OFF IT WAS ALL THE WAY AROUND.  I DO NOT MIND PAYING FOR A GOOD VAC, BUT REALLY!
Didn't work well  In the vacuum mode, it had very little suction.  In the mop mode, it was very labor intensive.  I returned it.
This product worked great for about 2 months and then it started to smoke and smell like it was going  to catch fire.
I have order about 4 but this last one does not seem strong enough is there any kind of warranty let me know pls I would like to  it does not work anymore can I send it back ?  I have order about 4 but this last one does not seem strong enough is there any kind of warranty let me know pls I would like to send it back>
Seems cheaper than the older models.  Not a fan of this model.  I have an older model that seems much more durable and isn't so cheap feeling.  When I push it forward (with power off), the head falls to the ground because the wheels don't support the weight.  Now after just 1 year of use, the head quit working and I've had to reach out for support and have had no response. Sad to say I would not purchase another Dyson product again. This one was a very poor design.
Craptastic.  This machine sucks, and not in the good way.  Since 2006, I have purchased no less than ten of these machines, with the last three being the newest Deluxe model.  Deluxe what?  I am about to return the third one because the on/off switch STOPS WORKING.  Always at the most inopportune time.  I'm not a hater.  I'm not disgruntled.  I'm just a girl with tile floors and dirty little rescue/foster dogs.  Is it too much to ask that a $160 machine works well?  No.  And that's even with me putting up with the clean water tank leaking out all over the floor.  I was much happier with the blue model before it.  Yeah the new one's prettier, but it's like seeing a good looking guy, but knowing damn well there's some woman somewhere tired of putting up with his crap.  Gimme ugly and faithful any day.
Doesn't last  I bought this vacuum about a year ago and slowly over time a few things have gone wrong with it. I guess the only good thing is that it really hasn't lost suction just as it states on the front of the unit, but through the rotational pet hair brush, now that's another story. I probably had it about 6 months when the rotational pet hair brush began to spin slower and slower, now it barely spins at all so it's useless. I've cleaned everything and checked for clogs everywhere but every path is as clear as I can see. Now it overheats constantly. I can't even use it for more than five minutes before it shuts off because of the built in thermostat. I did like the length of the hose though, but the vacuum itself is pretty light so it tends to topple over quite a bit while using the extension tools. The brackets that hold the extension cord are made of plastic, they are cracked and ready to break off. Only 4 of the cyclone chambers seem to get filled with dust, the rest of them stay clean so I'm not sure if that is part of the overheating problem but it seems like a vacuum should last more than a year. I wish I had thought about reading reviews before I bought this one!
Keep looking, this is a cheap dud.  I've had this vacuum less than a year and am very disappointed in it.  Blowing fine dust all over my house when I vacuum is not my goal.  Unfortunately, I think bagless vacuums are just prone to this issue.  In less than 6 months a plastic hinge broke when I emptied the canister.  so that has been taped shut and the whole thing needs to be opened to empty it now.  The end of the hose has been taped as it cracked with normal use.  While right out of the box it did work well and there are nice features like the cord rewind, it did not hold up to average everyday use.  I'm actually here on Amazon to buy a new belt for the head as the one I thought would fit at Walmart is too big.  After writing all this, it makes me consider just buying a new vacuum!
Serious Decline  I had the prior model of this vacuum. It did great service for years.  This version is cheaply made.  The hard plastic hose has a permanent bend in it---and it's narrow to begin with.  EVERYTHING gets stuck there.  The flexible part of the hose is cheap (cheaper, cheapest) flimsy thin rather brittle plastic.  NOTHING like the prior hoses.  Bad buy.  0 stars wouid be my choice if it were available.
Don't waste your money on this vaccum!  The base has no suction at all!  Brush should not be used on hardwood floors and without a brush it sucks the dust and hair... anything like cherios is not sucked in.  Even with the brush the suction is not there at all. The extension hose has great suction however forget extending it as far as they advertise it because it won't allow you to go anywhere outside of 2 ft from the vaccum it self.  it pulls the vaccum and you have to find something to hold your vaccum in place in order to extend the hose.  Last but not least, I will never buy another expensive product from Amazon.  The turn time for shipping was terrible and I had to pay tons of money to get it to come earlier due to having an allergic child.  I can not afford to return this product now because it would cost me more to return than to keep it.  My advise, don't buy this vaccum or try it in a store first.  Shipping costs will make you keep it and you won't be very happy.  There are cheapper vaccums that do a much better job than this one.
Shark Roadster  DON'T BUY THIS VACUUM!!!  I had it less than 3 months before it stopped working.  I took it to a vacuum repair place and they changed the belt (it had broken) but it still doesn't work.  Like the other reviews say, it shuts itself off after 5 minutes and doesn't pick up anything in the canister!
The Worst Vacuum I Ever Owned  Wow, it is almost like they tried to make the worst vacuum ever!  We bought this in Aug 2006, and it lasted about a month.  Since then, a piece has broken every month since then.  It started with the stair cleaner (only used once when it stopped working).  Next was the bare floor mode.  It won't turn on, and I have to clean all my bare floors (the entire downstairs of my house) with the hand-held attachement.  Which, by the way, won't fit on the vacuum anymore for some reason.  Next was the carpet mode.  It only works intermittently.  I plan on leaving this out for bulk trash this week.
Clogs, tangles, & doesn't fit under things  I purchased the Dyson Animal because I have 3 dogs and one is a German Shepherd and he sheds out a bucket load of hair every day.  Overall the vacuum works well but the dog hair balls up on one side so catch bin has to be emptied often and I usually have to pull the hair out with my hand when I empty it.  In addition to that I have very long hair and find that I frequently have to take apart the motorized brush bar to untangle all the hair wrapped around it, which basically defeats one of the other reasons why I bought this vac (from ads, I got the impression that would not be necessary)  Another downside is that it does not fit under the bed and there is no attachment that works really well under the bed.  Yes I can use the LITTLE tangle free turbine tool, but it is very small and frankly a pain.  Dyson you need to make a larger tangle free turbine tool attachment that can be used to vacuum larger areas and vac up long hair.  An attachment is needed that allows you to get under things like beds, dressers, etc.  I do, however, love the pet tool.  I use it to brush my shepherd and it rocks.  If not for this tool I probably would have rated you a TWO.
Clogs Easily - wouldn't recommend if you have pets.  The dirt cup clogs after vacuuming half a small room. When emptying and removing clogs, it's messy. I don't have pets but I can imagine it would be even worse with dog or cat hair. The retractable cord isn't easy to use. All in all the Hoover Windtunnel is frustrating to use. I bought the Hoover Windtunnel vacuum based on Consumer Reports review.
only if you love to vacuum....you'll be doing it a lot....  This vacuum is a huge disappointment. We have had it for a few years now and it definitely does NOT pick up like it used to. The claim that it doesn't lose suction is FALSE. The mini turbine head is pointless because the minute you touch it to carpet, it stops spinning. We have to vacuum over small bits of lint and dirt multiple times to get it to pick up. The bare floor attachment only picks up from the sides of the head, so you have to constantly adjust the angle you are vacuuming at to get a little dog hair off the hardwood. I am so disappointed with this vacuum, I can't believe I spent five hundred plus on it. If I could return it, I would.
Adequate for the money  My vaccum cleaner of many years died and I wanted to buy-some-time before purchasing another high-end model.  I saw this Panasonic AeroSpin on Amazon's daily deal and hoped it would suit my purpose.  It is exactly what I thought it would be: a CHEAP vaccum cleaner.  It is top heavy and tips over very easily which makes using the hoses difficult.  The retractable cord stopped retracting after 3 uses and the hand-tool didn't work right out of the box (there doesn't seem to be enough power for the hand tool).  However, the suction is pretty good and I do like the way the bagless canister empties from the bottom, right into your trash can at the push of a button.  For the money, it was not a bad purchase, but I will buy something better as soon as finances allow.
NOT a good vacuum for pet owners!  I don't know what criteria Hoover uses to label this as a pet vacuum, but it is certainly not!  I'll start with the stuff I like: It has good suction. It does not make too much noise. The retractable cord is nice and it is long.  Now the things I don't like about it: First the dirt canister is about the size of an old coffee can.  I have it empty it after every room. Emptying it means I have to remove the plastic canister from the vacuum, take it outside (since doing it inside makes more dust than it picked up) and then I need to pull the dirt out of it by hand!  There is NO WAY the pet hair and hay pieces (from our bunnies) will come out of it without pulling it all out by hand.  So either I need to get a pair of gloves each time or just dig in and then wash my hands thoroughly when I go back inside before moving onto the next room.  Just ridiculous!  Second, while the filtering is good, it also clogs VERY easily.  Probably more so because emptying it is such a chore that I try to squeeze two rooms before doing it.  Anyway, there is a dust filter on that that needs cleaning about every 4 times the vacuum is used.  I need to partially take the vacuum apart to take it out and then wash it in water and let it dry for 24 hours (per the instructions) before using it again.  Very inconvenient.  The corrugated hose is WAY too short.  If you try to stretch it to reach something (like in a bunny pen) and the end gets blocked, the suction pulls the hose back the vacuum and almost out of your hands.  Much too short to be terribly useful.  In addition the hose makes several tight bends, which means anything longer than a pin that is not flexible will get stuck in the hose at the bend, requiring disassembly and the use of some kind of stick to get it out.  The other issue I have might just be me, but when the handle and canister is tilted back, as when you are ready to vacuum, there is no lower-middle position latch.  I always used that middle position latch on my old vacuum to raise the front of the motor to go from floors to carpet and for going one way on small area rugs.  The only way to lift the front of the motor off the carpet is to lower the handle all the way to the floor, which is not convenient.  As a result I have had to wrestle several of the bathroom area rugs out of the brush on the front.  Finally the unit is quite heavy.  I know some weight is needed for good suction, but some modern light materials would be much better.  All in all if you need a vacuum for very light work and can put up with sticking you hands in the dirt to clean it, I guess this is okay, but if you have bunnies, dogs, cats, etc, you might want to consider other options.
Want to exchange  I have used this 4 or 5 times.  It cut off never to run again.
I have owned this vacuum cleaner for about a year.  Even though it does its job,  it is true that the little rubber wheels underneath produce skid marks all over the wooden floors in our house.  When emptying the canister, you will inadvertently inhale dust as the finest dust particles do not fall downward into the garbage bag but tend to float upward. My biggest problem with this vacuum cleaner however is the noise it produces.  In fact is by far the loudest vacuum I have ever owned (I had AEG, Miele and Kenmore vacuums before) so that I have started wearing earmuffs to protect my hearing and would highly recommend doing this to everyone who operates this vacuum cleaner on a weekly.
If I use the carpet setting on my bare floors then ONLY the dog hair gets sucked up, and the brush roller rotating causes all ..  This is an AWFUL vacuum cleaner. I have mostly bare floors because I have dogs. If I use the bare floor setting, then all of the dog hair collects on the brush roller and stops the vacuum sucking anything up. If I use the carpet setting on my bare floors then ONLY the dog hair gets sucked up, and the brush roller rotating causes all of the other crumbs and dirt to fling around everywhere. I actually hate this vacuum, and gave it a comparatively high 2 star rating because it does work on carpet. Don't get this vacuum if you have bare floors. It is utterly useless. By the way, I initially loved this vacuum. But, I've had it for a year and grown to hate all of its down sides.
Sucks, and not in the good way.  You get what you pay for.  Sucks, and not in a good way.  You get what you pay for.  This won't show up as "verified" as my better half bought it, but I just put it together and used it for the first time.  Negatives:  1)  The cord is short.  Very short.  I used to be able to do the entry way and great room from one outlet -- now it's from three.  Two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a dining room from one outlet now requires plugging and unplugging for each room.  And my house is *not* large.  2)  The dirt chamber is ridiculously small -- rather than changing a bag every 5-10 vacuums of the house (or more!), I now have to dump it out at least once, if not two or three times per *room*.  Worse, dog hair clogs at the back of the chamber, so you lose suction before you can see it's adding up in there.  It looks empty, but might as well be full with the hair clogging the back.  3)  Speaking of emptying the chamber:  This thing should NOT get to call itself "HEPA."  When you dump the chamber, dust goes everywhere.  Which you're going to be doing a LOT.  Worse, you have to dig around with your hand to get any dog hair out -- if you have pets, skip this one.  Bags are much, MUCH cleaner, and worth the trivial added expense.  I'm being generous and giving it two stars because the cord retraction system is handy and works -- we'll see how long it lasts, of course, and I fear it's just a gimmick to break -- and it's reasonably cheap.  Yes, when the container is empty, it provides a good amount of floor-cleaning suction, but the number of times you'll have to plug/unplug and/or empty the canister completely defeats any benefit.  If you have a small place and no pets and no real need to vacuum, then it might do the trick.  Otherwise, save up some money and get a commercial unit that uses bags -- you'll be MUCH happier.  The whole bagless fad is a scam to sell new vacuums to people who have a perfectly functional one, if you ask me.
Crappy - don't waste your money  useless. Very, very disappointed. Picks up almost nothing; can't leave it plugged in, so you have to plan in advance when you're going to use it so you can charge it for 24 hours before use. I threw it away.
extremely disappointed  Let me first say that this vacuum does a good job on carpeting.  That's it.  If you have floors, stairs, crevices, furniture, etc. then don't buy this vacuum.  I have an old Hoover Windtunnel that is much better than this new model.  They tried to fix some of the things that were wrong with the old version and in the process also emlimiated the good features.  The Max is very noisy.  It has a limited number of tools and a short, stretchy hose that pulls up from the bottom so whenever you use it the vacuum drags along behind you.  The upholstery tool attaches to the front of the machine and falls off every time you knock it ever so slightly.  It has fewer bristles than the older brush and is not nearly as effective.  The brush attachment also has very short bristles and again, is not as effective as the original tool.  I would definitely not buy this vacuum again.
Almost perfect except one deal breaker  This vacuum would be perfect except the hose is so short that the attachments are unusable. If you are just vacuuming floors this is not a problem. But if you have pets, you have to vacuum lots of different surfaces, like couches and cat trees. The hose is very short and does not stretch far. If you try to reach something that is more that a few inches away, the vacuum falls over. Even if you detach the canister, the attachment cannot reach more than a few inches away from it. To get to a high place, you have to lift the canister up high with one hand and use the other hand to work the attachment. Super bad design for what could be a very good machine. I paid $170 for this product thinking I would get the top of the line. A total waste of money. I shouldn't have to do advanced yoga poses just to vacuum the couch. I'm getting rid of this one and going back to Eureka.
Look for something else  We bought this vacuum at Costco a while back.  It's a great vacuum.  It has great suction, the swivel makes it easy to maneuver, and works really well.  The problem with this vacuum is that it's cheaply made.  Too much of it is plastic and the plastic pieces break or break off.  The canister, something you are going to be taking on and off all the time to empty, has small plastic pieces that snaps it into place.  Guess what the first piece to break was...  Now the canister won't stay on and my husband ended up using duct tape to keep the canister attached.  Inside the canister is small tube that funnels the debris into the canister.  It cracked and out comes the duct tape again.  The filter has a rubber ring around it that keeps it in place.  It disintegrated.  We looked at replacing the broken parts because we like it but just three pieces that need to be replaced cost almost as much as replacing the vacuum.  It's to bad because it worked well.  Thanks to Costco's awesome return policy I was able to take it back today despite not having the box or receipt.  Otherwise I would be more upset about spending this much money on a vacuum and having it fall apart piece by piece.
I hate this vacuum!  I have had nothing but trouble with clogging, pieces falling off, hundreds of dollars worth of service. I bought it in '09 and time has told me never again!
Carpet destroyer!  BEWARE!!  This vacuum model will destroy your carpet the first time you attempt to use the accessories. Why??? Because the inept designers omitted the "roller brush off" capability.  Thus, as you use the hose and attachments on your furniture, the carpet brush is dining away on your rug.  Honestly, what upright vac doesn't have an auto-off feature when you click it into the vertical position?  Nowhere on this site's description does it make mention of this "feature".  I spoke with three layers of Bissell Customer (don't) Care and got zero help.  Even though other Bissell models do have a roller control switch (dig into their fine print bowels on the Bissell web, not Amazon), I would shy away from this brand entirely because of their indignant customer support.
to be returned  Consumer Reports listed this vacuum as a "best buy" but having used it once, it's going back to the store.  I don't share the opinion of other reviewers that it is hard to turn on/off, or that the tool dial is a nuisance, or that emptying the dust canister is messy.  I didn't even notice those things.  But what does bother me:  ---heavy, clunky, practically wrenches my arm out trying to manuever it, misses corners  ---leaves 5 deep tracks everywhere it goes, the carpet looks etched with stripes  ---very poor performance on bare floors  ---the tool attachment has rollers that somehow permanently scratched my 50-year old mid-century built-in black vinyl sofa  ---the tool hose continually comes loose from it's moorings while using the upright vacuum, flops onto the floor  ---the lid of the dust canister is supposed to snap together but doesn't fit  ---the bracket holding the tool options won't snap in place, fell off before the first use  The reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because it does clean the carpet well.  But using it is such an ordeal I can tell I would dread getting it out.  And I don't need any more discouragement in keeping my house clean!
The brush broke and it leaks water leaving dirty spots on the floor  After 2 months the vacuum stopped working.  The brush broke and it leaks water leaving dirty spots on the floor.  Very disappointing considering I have only used it like 4 times.
Struggler 40.  Don't waste your money. This unit has a base that's too light.  It falls over when you try to use the way too stiff hose.  In fact the hose is so stiff that it won't loosely expand and makes it nearly impossible to use on such things as couches.  I have had mine for three years now.  On stairs it's just plain useless in terms of ergonomics.  If you enjoy straining and towing the uncooperative hose behind you.  My 5 gallon shop vac is easier to use.  This vacuum is worthless on high shag carpets.  The beater bar gets fouled by the simplest things.  Plan on cleaning the filters often. Like after 2 or three normal uses. I keep a tight ship and my home doesn't ask much of any appliance.  Get a conventional vacuum from Hoover or Kirby.  I have field tested this item for a few years under normal and sometimes heavy use.  It's not worth the money or effort. Dyson should have made the extension hose much more loose and flexible.  Should have made the base heavier instead of selling the "ball" as product differentiation and value added.  Buyer beware.
Totally Overrated!  This product is by far the most maneuverable vacuum I've ever used. It required very little input on the handle to move and make turns, etc.. Thats about where the good about this vacuum ends.  First, the most annoying thing about this entire vacuum is the cord is too short! Your milage may vary, but using this vacuum in even a small home will require you to change plugs multiple times in order to sweep.  Second, it is made of very cheap and chincy plastic. Over time, the plastic becomes brittle and cracks. I've already had to replace the tank and the hose because the red tank release rod broke and the hose end connection to the handle broke off when I was cleaning steps. It's absurd that you can pay this much for a vacuum cleaner and the quality of materials are the same as a $40 one from Walmart.  The suction isn't bad, but if you run this unit over a section of thicker carpet, it doesn't pick up much. The brush system isn't designed for the typical beige carpet found in most modern homes... Running a 20 year old oreck over the same spot of carpet will yeild picked up dirt. I will give it this, it works pretty well on solid floors.  Is it worth the price? No. That's all there is to it.
I would not buy this vacuum  Where to start on this machine!  The wheels do not stay on the base.  The handle became wabbly and the knob that switches the unit from floor to carpets does not stay in the up right position...I had to tape it. Also the unit becomes clogged very quickly which means you have to stop what your doing because the machine just stops sucking and starts to make the worst sound you have ever heard. You then have to take the filter outside and bang it to knock the dust off of it so it will work again.  I will say that when it does work this tiny machine will pick up debris off of carpet...I don't think it works all that well on bare floors. Yes it is light weight and vacuums when the filter is clean but who wants to spend a lot of time cleaning out the filter and chasing wheels around the house just to vacuum.  I WOULD NOT BUY THIS UNIT!
Hoover Wind Tunnel Anniversary Let Down  Wow! Really? I was under the impression this vacuum would be easier to use! The craftsmanship is a cheaper quality that I've ever purchased before from Hoover! It is difficult to adjust from HI to Low level settings, as the slide bar tends to get stuck. The power of the vacuum itself IS VERY GOOD, but overall I was disappointed with this "Anniversary" item. Time for a Hoover DIVORCE!
dead within a month  I thought this vacuum would be a good value after reading the reviews.  The first time I used it, I though it was okay on the floors, but not very good on the area rug.  The second time I used it, it just stopped and died.  I emptied the canister, checked the cord, detached all the parts to see if something got stuck somewhere, but couldn't bring it to life.  It's a waste of $$$.
V shape is a poor design  Bissell got too clever in designing this.  A traditional, straight base may be boring, but at least it's functional.  Instead, the V shaped base on this model is very frustrating to use - vacuuming along baseboards and other straight edges is difficult.  The machine has good suction, is quiet, and well built, but the design flaw makes all this moot.  This model is highly rated by Consumer Reports which is why I selected this model, but they missed the mark this time. Pick a different model.
It was repaired under warranty and things were good for a while  I bought this this about 8 months ago.  A portion of the plastic housing broke off after 2 uses.  We exchanged that vacuum for a new one, which also had a section of the plastic housing break off after a few uses.  It was repaired under warranty and things were good for a while.  The vacuum is quiet, has great suction and is easy to maneuver.  The cord is really long allowing you to go from room to room without having to unplug.  Unfortunately, the vacuum is back in the shop again for repairs as the motor suddenly became extremely loud.  I really wanted to like this vacuum, but it has been in the repair shop more than is acceptable for a $500 vacuum.
I bougth this vaccum about a year ago and after a few month it started falling apart. Cheap quality..
Constantly falls apart!  This vacuum falls under the category, "you get what you pay for."  This is a cheap vacuum so as long as your expectations aren't that high, you'll like it.  Here's the good and bad (and terrible):  Good: Powerful suction, small, lightweight, easy to empty Bad: Loud, power cord seems shorter than usual Terrible: The hose/wand falls apart about every 30 seconds while using the vacuum.  There are four connections and all of them disconnect easily because there's nothing to lock them into place.  I am CONSTANTLY reattaching the hose while vacuuming.  I've actually thought about super-gluing the connections but then I worry that I won't be able to unclog them if something big accidentally gets sucked up.  Very strange design.
Works well, looks crappy  I've had this vacuum for only 2 weeks and have only used it once.  It seems to work really well.  The problem is that the "tool cover" part is apparently not being made anymore and makes the vacuum look like it was purchased at a garage sale.  I received the vacuum and did not receive the tool cover (located on the front of the vacuum and is supposed to hold the "pet hair tool" in place).  The pet hair tool will not stay where it's supposed to and the vacuum looks old and crappy without that piece.  I contacted Hoover and they told me that part isn't made anymore.  What a joke!  My brand-new vacuum looks about 10 years old with missing parts...
Disappointed  I had heard so many positive reviews for this vacuum so after researching a number of vacuums, i decided to try this one out. PROS- *Awesome suction *clear bag-less section, reassuring that the suction is working well.  CONS- *Extremely heavy, by the time i got to vacuuming the second room, my back hurt and i had to really push the vacuum to get it across the room *Pipe isn't really easy to move around. Because of the solid part, it doesn't really turn or move around *The first day i bought the vacuum, it already started making a grinding noise. The suction was still working,however the noise was so unbearable i had to stop vacuuming  In the end, i'm returning this vacuum and going back to buying a canister vacuum. Those are also annoying to haul around, but at least i won't have to break my back vacuuming one room.
AVOID THIS (unless you have duct tape)s  We have a tile floor an a little bit of carpet. First off the hose gets plugged with stuff AND you can't get it out. Second, the wheel (it's plastic) broke. So duct tape. Then the hose connector broke. So duct tape. Then the other end of hose broke where it attached to the head. So MORE duct tape. Do you see a pattern here. My kids are older, we don't have pets inside and it is not used every day. It lasted a little over a year, but the duct tape started MUCH MUCH earlier. So, I am here looking for a REAL one. Last Hoover I EVER buy.
Poor design. The vacuum worked fine other than that  The brush feature that is supposed to spin once it's put on the hose does not work. The suction is not strong enough to cause the brush inside to move, and the brush doesn't even touch the carpet. Poor design. The vacuum worked fine other than that.
low quality plastic crap  really cheaply made with plastic parts I'm sure will break soon - I wish I had returned it immediately!
At first it worked great, now it gets clogged and overheats  I have had this product for a little over 2 years. At first it worked great, now it gets clogged and overheats. I have unclogged it multiple times, and then tried it again, and it continues to clog and overheat. Would not recommend buying this product unless you want to replace it after only a few years.
Not the Best for Multiple Cats...  I was sooooo excited to get my hands on the highly touted Dyson DC25.  I own three cats and was sure this thing would help me keep cat hair and litter down to a minimum. After I set it up I got to work vacuuming my carpets where my cats hang out the most. I'll admit it did picked up the hair and litter. BUT when I was done there was residual cat hair, litter flecks and even some ground litter dust coating the outside of my Dyson vacuum -- the ball, the wheels, and the front part of the vacuum. It was frustrating to have to clean the exterior of my Dyson after I used it when the cyclone power boasts that it picks everything up from the floor without blowing it around. Well, apparently that was not the case, considering what was left coating the outside of the machine...  I'm a bit disappointed, what with all the hype Dyson receives about their awesome vacuums. I guess I own one too many cats to have this machine works its magic for me.
Terrible vacuum  I bought the vacuum in new and factory-sealed conditions. But the two batteries lasted only about a year and died quickly. The customer service is bad too. After waiting for 45 min on the phone to talk to someone at Hoover customer service, they refused to honor their commitment to replace their so-called "LIfe-Time Warranty" batteries.
Dont buy used to save a few bucks.  I understood I was purchasing a sweeper that was used. Thus sweeper came in torn box, broken and jammed belt view window, tools that I have no idea where they go and the sweeper is in two or three parts with missing screws that would hold it together. Frustrating.
I am disappointed with Hoover  Hoover missed the mark on this product. The Self propel feature quit working after 8 months. The pet hair tool is difficult and time consuming to clean. I am going to contact Hoover to see if they can help me with these issues. You have to "babysit" the self propel feature. All of a sudden it feels like you are pushing against a gorrilla! The bagging system is working well, it doesnt fill up too fast. I have 2 long haired pooches.
The Vacuum worked great for 2 months  The Vacuum worked great for 2 months. Beater bar broke. Took it in for warranty repair 3 weeks ago. Vacuum still not repaired. Unit has to be sent off to there repair center for repair. 2 minute job to replace and they won't send me the part. I'll never buy anything from sears again.
45 days later and belt had to be replaced  I researched vacuums very well before purchasing the Hoover Windtunnel Max.  I really liked the vacuum until it began making a HORRIBLE noise when I used it on a bare floor.  We called Hoover and was told to take it to a local shop.  We were told the belt was slipping; therefore making the noise, because it had already worn out.  We only have carpet in one room, and I may have used the vacuum once or twice a week during the 45 days we owned it (I use a smaller cordless vac for the hard wood floors).  Naturally, it is past the 30 day return policy with Amazon so we are stuck with this vacuum.  If I could return it, I would!
Not as good as my DC 07  This would be a great vacuum in my opinion for someone with minimal carpeting. I bought this and i own a DC 07 well we ran them side by side and this did not have the suction of my DC 07, it did not pull up the carpet as well as my DC 07. I would not recommend it to anyone with heavy carpeting or pets.  I thought i wanted a new Dyson just because i had gotton some money. So i returned this one and got the Dyson DC33 and this one is GREAT! I don't know if its the ball design or what, but i have tried a couple of ball designs, uprights, and canisters, and the ball is the only one lacking in suction.  I am happy with my Dyson DC33. I am going to hang onto my DC 07 and see just to make sure i am happy with the Dyson DC33.
I have Buyers remorse!  I think of all my purchases in my 57 years, I have the most buyers remorse over this Miele C3 Brilliant vacuum! Feels cheap, already making weird noises. The power head has poor edge suction at the front and sides, it won't suck the littlest things out of the edge next to the wall. The height adjustment of the power head is clunky, the auto cord reel is cool but noisy, the extra attachments are expensive and feel cheap. VERY disappointed in this vacuum, the Kenmore Elite is a third the price and a much better unit. Do not purchase this vacuum.
I have to say I am thoroughly displeased with the "trick" on the warranty of this product.  My vacuum I have only had since April of 2016 and it is not working again.  Second time in such a short period.  They told me IF I had purchased it thru Shark my vacuum would have a full warranty but since I purchased it thru Amazon it is a limited warranty and it will cost me almost $100 to have it repaired. They said the part that is not working is a wearable part!!  This is the motorized floor nozzle!!  RIDICULOUS!!!  I will not recommend a shark again as I think this is pretty deceptive to warranty their product different depending on who sells it to you.  There should be NO difference if you purchase it from Shark or Amazon on the warranty.  VERY disappointing. I have attached a picture of what they call the "wearable" part.
Very poor quality  I hate to say it, as I like Panasonic products in general, but this vacuum is very poor. We have owned 2 of these in the past 8 years, and have replaced the hose assembly twice in the past 2 years. The plastic is very flimsy on the hose, and will snap easily when vacuuming rugs.
Buy something else  Did not buy this product from Amazon but you need to be aware this thing has turned out to be a real piece of junk. Roller/brush stops turning for no reason. Disassemble/reassemble (5 times so far, but no more), works fine for a little while then stops again. No broken parts, belt's OK. Just stops working. Going in the trash. After being a Hoover user for over 40 years I will never buy another Hoover product again.
Buy something else  I have had this vacuum for well over two years now. I did my research and decided on this one. My #1 complaint and reason for its dislike is the tip over hazard it has. When using the hose attachment the vacuum will fall toward you. This happens almost each time I use the hose. I have gotten cracked before and it hurts. My suggestion....find another vacuum cleaner without the tip over hazard.
No No Not used !  My wife asked why I bought used when for $50 more I could have bought new with 5-year warranty. When this product arrived it was damaged. The electrical cord was frayed and the housing broken. Save yourself the hassle, buy new. Good vacuum.
It works great except for the attachment to clean carpets  It works great except for when it comes to carpets. When it comes carpets/area rugs even if they are not thick, you will never get the job done unless that it is dust what you are trying to pick. Considerably less noisy than most vacuums I had. I had to purchase something completely different.
Bad Choice  I have owned this Vacuum for one year. DO NOT BUY ONE!! I have had in the repair shop 4 times. This was my worst purchase.
wouldnt recommend  wheels keep falling off,thing easily gets plugged up,tho loved 2 batteries. instead of messing with a cord i continually had to try to get wheels to stay on and unclog it.
Buy something better  We had the machine less than 6 months and it has not preformed to the listed expectations. Always clogged quickly and had to pull filter and clean between each room. Duster is just for show and does not work as well as it should. The last straw was, we could not figure why the height adjustment just did not work. Inspecting further we found that out of the box the piece was either missing a part or broken. We are getting rid of it and going with something better. This one has been a real disappointment.
Worst vacuum I ever purchased.  Overheats and shuts off after using on carpet for 2 to 3 minutes.
Issues  Product had problems right out of the box. doesn't want to be pulled back on floor and handle has issues too! I will get to see how customer service works.....Not happy with initial experience for sure!
Don't do it!!!!!!!!!  Wow,I was so excited to treat myself to a new vacuum. The belt DOES NOT stay on the motor. I took it to an authorized service center and he said it just needed a new screw put in......I don't think so. I didn't have it home 5 minutes and the belt came off again. Great vacuum if only the belt stayed on, that happens to be  a big problem. Don't do it you'll only be aggravated. Keep looking.......Betsy Steckel
Defective Hose, getting replacement  Had to return this one for a replacement - the hose was defective.
Can't get the handle attached...  I'm not digging it at the moment.  Just got it today and tried to put it together and can't unscrew the screw to put the handle on it!!  It just turns with the pin like it's seized up!  I'll see if my husband can put it together when he gets home....I'll change my review if I can get it together....:(  Looks like y'all are getting it back, because something is wrong with the screw and pin for the handle.
Not good.  This vacuum was not good.  I returned and bought a shark lift away for about a hundred dollars more but works 100 times better.  Sorry hoover vacuum, I really wanted to like you.
what a waste of money  Got this for my daughter as a wedding present. Second time they used it brown debris appeared on the floor and a bad odor emitted from the vacuum. Don't waste your money on this product, it is a dud.
Cheap  Vacuum broke after only 6 months of use.
DANGEROUS VACUUM ... DO NOT BUY  This is a dangerous vacuum in that it blows dirty air back into the room. The "Dirt Cup" (which encloses the filter and catches the dirt/dust) latches poorly and has a flimsy gasket that does not completely engage to seal out dirty air from re-entering the living space. After a 5 second use, there was a noticeable smell. On inspection, dirt could be easily seen bypassing the gasket. A genuine hazard for people sensitive to dirt and dust, and a nuisance to anyone wanting a clean house. Unit was returned to Dirt Devil. Getting a RA from customer service took a total of 40 minutes on the phone.
returned
My favorite small portable vacuum....great for cars!  Have used these small Orecks for years.  This is my third and can't rave about them enough.  This one is even better than the last...more bells and whistles.  The perfect small use vacuum in my opinion and lots of power.  This is an update 6 months later.....this Oreck has lost all its power after only 6 months of use.  Really can't understand it as this was a total surprise.  The unit was excellent to begin with and now I have to toss it.  Not useful at all....just frustrating to even try to vacuum.  Is there a warranty? Have to check that out.
Defective deep clean carpet power head!  Vacuum seems to work fine but power head makes awful screeching noise!
Waste of money and time going over carpet repeatedly!  Not happy. Ive owned this for a year and Ive been very disappointed. It does more of pushing and blowing dirt and lint around than lifting it. Even using the suction tools is useless. I wastes so much time going over an area repeatedly. What a waste of money. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it still runs, seems to collect some dirt after multiple runs, and is light. I had an old heavy eureka before this and it was awesome. Lasted me 7 years! Im shopping for a new vacuum!
don't buy it .... will only last a year  Lasted less then one year took it in for repair and Dyson wouldn't honor warranty.... Cost to repair it would have been 300 plus dollars ..... So yea not buying another Dyson
Great Idea - doesn't live up to description  I'm not sure why I kept this.  I should have returned it, but it's too late now.  The vacuum function is worthless if you're trying to vacuum up anything even the size of a lentil.  You will have to sweep first, and then use this to get up any fine dust you might have missed as that is all it can pick up.  If you have a messy toddler and are hoping to clean up all those spills at once, this is not for you.  It is much easier and takes less time to lean over with a clothe and wipe up a mess as you will have to run this cleaner over each individual spot about 30 times to get it cleaned up.  The "dry" function is worthless.  It does not dry the floor.  It merely "squeegies" the standing water.  Your floor will be still very wet afterwards.  It says you can use this to clean up a spill.  It will get the majority of it up, but will leave a wet layer over the entire area.  You'll still need to get out towels and clean it.  When removing the dirty water tank, the handle to pull it out with is not attached to the top.  If you pull it out, quickly grab the tank as it will otherwise fall off the handle and splatter all over the floor.  Don't buy it.  It's no better than a cheaper one.  If you really need a good cleaner, you're going to have to spend more than this.
Many Design Flaws  Our old Hoover WindTunnel bagless had seen better days, and having a shedding dog we decided to try a bagged vacuum so we wouldn't have to empty the canister each use.  This product received top marks in the leading consumer review magazine, so we decided to give it a try.  After using it for a couple weeks, we decided there were just too many design flaws to keep this $200 vacuum.  On a positive note, the vacuum does have very good suction power. It is also lighter than our old WindTunnel and with the self-propel feature feels ever lighter in use.  Although the self-propel is a good idea for heavy vacuum cleaners, on this vacuum it is difficult to control. I found myself running into baseboards and furniture, having a hard time controlling it. Although the vacuum has height adjust, I couldn't adjust it low enough to clean our berber carpet. The self propel also adds to the already very loud operating noise, especially on hard surfaces. This is the loudest vacuum I have ever used. My ears were actually ringing after vacuuming for 15 minutes, and I did not feel comfortable using it around my 15 month old child.  The next big design flaw is the accessory hose outlet position. It exits the vacuum too high, causing the vacuum to tip over easily when stretching the hose. It hit me on the back a few times, very frustrating. Another problem is the accessory tools attachments don't hold well. During regular vacuuming it is easy to bump the accessory tools and they fall out because the plastic retainers are poorly designed. The base of the vacuum is too tall to fit under standard kitchen cabinets (it gets stuck if trying to vacuum underneath the overhang).  Finally, after using the vacuum only 5 times, the bag was full. Like I said we have a shedding dog, but I still think this is unacceptable.  Having to change the bag twice a month will become costly, even with the cheap knock off bags.  We ended up returning this vacuum thoroughly disappointed, but I haven't lost all faith in Hoover. We plan to try one of their new bagless uprights with the lifetime filters.  I would not recommend this Anniversary edition WindTunnel.
Not worth the money  We bought this same item from Walmart cause it was cheaper than Amazon, same exact product.  We bought it due to the reviews of it.  Let me give a bit of a back ground on my usage of Vac cleaners.  I have ALWAYS used reviews and CSR to help with the selection of a vac cleaner.  I have usually used Hoover, cause they always seem to have great reviews and work well.  The ONLY reason why I end buying a new one over a couple years is, cause even though I clean them regularly and change out filters, they seem to still stink like animals, and give off a bad wet dog smell.  So I buy a new one.  Then I switched to a cheaper Bissell one pass 2 years ago.  I still have it, but it too stinks,  I even shower with the vac components and wash them thoroughly, even the hoses.  This works, till about the 3rd use of the vac, then it stinks again.  So I tried the Shark brand,  I figured 10,000 reviewers couldn't be wrong, and CR best buy too.  Well,  I guess I need to put into account, that there are 25 million people in the US who are blinded by the non-common sense syndrome.  This is the 3rd time I have used reviews and CR to help make a purchase and it was bogus.  This shark vac just looked cheap right from the beginning.  So I vacuumed with my bissell first (only my downstairs, as the bissell is used up stairs where all the pets are.. then I went over it with my new shark.  After that I went back over it with the bissell again.  The bissell filled up with junk both times, while the shark barely managed to do anything.  I noticed that the brush was not very much hugging the floor, there is no adjustment for it,  and on the handle of the shark is a suction control knob.  This was bogus,  it was actually preventing it from having a true suction that was needed in my opinion.  So I gave it one more chance.  I used the hose portion on my steps.  Since these get alot of wear, I went over it very well with the hose.  i noticed the hose too had a suction control with holes, allowing air to escape so the unit would not get stuck on something blah blah blah.  I taped over this part, and finally saw some real power.  With full suction, I cleaned the steps twice and was still sucking up crap in the fibers, stuff the other vacs never got.  The issue is however,  thats all this vac was good for, using the hose portion (after I taped over the air holes - otherwise it got no suction).  With this issue and the fact it was just too cheaply made for me, I returned it.  I did like the swivel feature, that was nice, but overall not worth the price tag for steps cleaning, and since my old vacuum was getting twice the crap,  its not worth it to me, and while it says cleaner air,  I still was able to smell a little exhaust from it.  Not sure who reviewed this thing, but their reviews made it worse for me.
No Height Adjustment  Returned it as it was pulling my carpet off the floor!  Needed to add a height adjustment.
Broken after 10 Times of use, do not recommend
Total waste of money!!!  Not a quality product, i purchased in Jan 2015 and it started giving problem just after 7 months of normal use. It stopped working completely after 8 months. Not worth buying!!!
The suction is not to strong. Doesnt pick up . Constantly vacuuming same area to pick up small pieces . Not worth it
Nothing Maxima about It  This blue canister came in a box with featuring a yellow canister (different model number). It has small capacity bags and we cannot locate a place to purchase them after-market.
Picks up dirt fine but is very heavy.  Hard to push.
Broken after 11 months  I received this as a housewarming gift in January 2007. 11 months later, it hardly ever turns on. It is totally broken. Spoke to Hoover and they told me to bring it to the service center since it was in warranty. Did that, they told me they could not fix it. Hoover will not stand by their product and Amazon can't help me after the 6 month point. So I am stuck with a vacuum that doesn't even turn on. Save yourself the aggrivation and don't buy a Hoover .What a nightmare. And amazingly, Hoover couldn't care less and actually told me that I should buy a new vacuum. One rep on their help desk asked me 'what do you expect for $180?'. Outrageous. Don't buy this product. I threw mine away and bought a Dyson. What a shame. A waste of money and I am sure there are others all over the place buying this horrible product and just throwing it away in under a year.
I am now on my 3rd Bissell Hard Floor Expert Bagless Canister Vacuum and after less than 2 months of using each, the roller brush does not work.  I took the second vacuum to a Bissell recommended repairman and he checked it out and declared a design flaw.  I notified Bissell and they once again told me to cut cord off and send to them and they would send me a "working" vacuum.  I received this 3rd vacuum on May 24, 2018, and today, July 12, 2018, it is not working--surprise, surprise...the roller brush is not working.  Very disappointed and disgusted with Bissell!!!
Falls Apart At 9 Months  Do not buy this product. In 9 months this very expensive vacuum cleaner is falling apart. Customer service has not responded - not once - even though (or perhaps because) this vacuum is still under warranty.  And I want my money back.  Problems with this vacuum: first, the power cord refused to stay out, then the hose came loose, and finally the filter refused to stay connected - it pops out and the vacuum stops working altogether. Our last vacuum cleaner, a Kenwood, worked for 10 years.  This one ran for 9 months and cost three times as much. Don't buy it.
Worst vacuum ever  This is the worst vacuum. Ever. It has good suction, but that suction doesn't translate to the attachments, which are made from cheap, flimsy plastic. We spend most of the time chasing debris around both Oriental rugs and wood floors. For mat-types surfaces, one must get on hands and knees and scrub with the small cheap brush to remove debris.  No beater bar, enough said.  I don't know who these folks are who love this vacuum but they're all over the internet. Don't buy this piece of junk.
Disappointed With Carpet Performance  We have owned the vacuum for a few months now.  We liked the positive reviews on allergen control and low noise performance of this model.  If you're looking for a unit for light use, especially for use on floors the rating would be higher than given here; but we really needed a vacuum that could handle carpets.  This unit is not at all acceptable for use on carpets.  The head does not adjust to carpets well and it takes a lot of work to vacuum carpet.  The power head is rather small too, which means it takes longer to cover a larger area.  I really wish that others had provided this information when we were shopping, in hindsight we paid a lot of money for a vacuum which performs so poorly on carpets.  Our recommendation to anyone who is considering this model is to go see one in person and try it out on the types of surfaces you will be cleaning.
Do NOT buy  Severely dissapointed. This refurbished vacuum does not work.  It makes a loud buzzing sound every time I have it on that won't go away and does not suction the way my other Dyson used to. I cannot return because by the time I used it enough to know it did not work the window had closed ! What a rip off!  Do not buy this.  I think that Dyson should send me a new vacuum!
I needed a small light weight vacuum cleaner for my living room area rug. I thought this would be able to handle a 12x8 rug, but sadly it doesnt. The suction is poor quality and most of the wool fibers are blown onto my wood floors. So now Im doing double the work, vacuuming the rug and sweeping up what the vacuum fans pushes out. Not satisfied with this product at all
DO NOT BUY  Please do not ignore the 1 star reviews like I did. I have used once. The vacuum does not work. Seriously. When I tried the wash function it did scrub but did not clean up the dirt. I tried sweeping all dirt up first then using the wash function. All it did was push dirty water around. I turned it off and left it. This morning I went to put it up and it had leaked water on my wood floors causing them to warp. Total waste of money.
Stopped working  Stopped working after 3 months of use.
would not purchase again  I have had this vacumn for 3 months. the suction is mediocre at best. now it has no suction. After trying everything in the product manual I called bissell support. of course I had to repeat everything I had already done despite telling the representative what I had already tried. still no suction. they are replacing the machine. I wanted a machine that could do hardwood floors and area rugs. would not say it deals well with rugs at all, even with the correct floor attachment.
Lasted 6 months
Terrible for Pet Hair  This is a review of the Shark Rocket NV472.  As the one star rating I gave it indicates, this is the worst vacuum I have ever had. It is heavy, difficult to maneuver, and requires constant maintenance.  After owning it for one year I am giving up and relegating it to the trash bin. It's worst feature is the tendency of the brush roll to get clogged with hair. After every us you have to get down on the floor and cut the hair out.  Anyone who owns a pet should definitely not purchase this vacuum. This is the first Sharp I have ever owned so other models may be better but this one is terrible.
Terrible vacuum. Attachments suck, doesn't pick up anything, waste of money.
It was a terrible choice. It was OK for a few months  It was a terrible choice. It was OK for a few months, but after that it really does not have any suction and does not clean anything. Moreover, after 6 months of using it the motor warms up and the machine stops after less than 5 mins! I had to just throw it away and get another vacuum cleaner!
Disappointing. Bought based on a review that said this will get the tiles AND grout sparkling clean. I gave it a 2 and not a 1 because it was very easy to assemble but the parts are all plastic and look as if they will break easily. The unit absolutely doesn't even hit the grout--only the tile. It cleaned the tile as evidenced by dirty water in the attached water container but the grout which is slightly lower than the tile wasn't touched. The unit barely sprays any water and then sucks it up right away before any scrubbing using water actually takes place. It seems good for light cleaning but not a good scrub and grout cleaning which is what I was hoping before. I'm sending it back....
Powerful, but poorly made.  Purchased this for my mother who had shoulder replacement surgery and needed a lightweight vacuum. This was still too heavy for her to lift. Rather than ship it back, I decided to keep it for myself. It has excellent suction power, but is made so poorly that the pieces come apart while I'm vacuuming. The suction pulls the brush tightly to the carpet, but the pole pulls out of the brush attachment as I pull back. And the hose is so flimsy that it bends and kinks up, blocking the airflow. It's ok for smooth surfaces, but even there the attachments fall off very easily. I wouldn't recommend this vacuum for anything other than reaching high areas for cobwebs, etc. (without the attachment brush - don't want to have it fall on you).
Worst buy ever!  Has to be the worst Electrolux vacuum EVER!!  My mom had Electrolux for years.  I was so confident in the brand I bought one for my home and one for my shop. The shop died after about a year.  Stopped sucking.  The house vacuum sucks fine until you pop the hose then nothing.  The attachment holders broke almost immediately.  It squeels like a stuck pig after you dump the dirt until you get more dirt in there.  Whatever you do DO NOT buy this piece of garbage!
Frustrating to use, not worth the price  It's hard for me to express in words how much I dislike this vacuum. If I held my own version of Burning Man, called Burning Vacuum, that might do it. I don't normally like to post negative reviews (and I usually like Kenmore products) but if I can prevent one person from making a mistake and getting this vacuum it will be worth it.  My wife purchased this vac because it was highly rated by Consumer Reports. Unfortunately, due to her back injury, I do almost all the vacuuming. First, this thing is a behemoth. It's huge and weighs a lot. I'm not a weak guy, I have my own construction company and I'm used to carrying lumber and 80 lb bags of cement around, but 20 minutes pushing this vac back and forth and my lower back is hurting. It's like pushing a Hummer through your living room. (It seems to have unusually high rolling resistance, which adds to the problem.) When using it I ended up walking all the way to one end of the room, then all the way back to the other end of the room, like I was mowing the lawn. That was much easier than standing and yanking the beast back and forth.  Given its size, if you want to vacuum in tight spaces you can forget it. Want to pick up the front of the vac to get it over a threshold or trim strip? The designers didn't bother to include a handle on the front, so picking it up is a pain, there's no good place to grab on.  The bristles on the rotating carpet brush (the main one in the head of the vac) are about as stiff as a wire brush so you have to be careful not to have the brush height set too low when you vacuum carpets. The vac did obvious damage to our expensive hand-carved area rug the first time I used it out of the box, with the height set to low. I noted that the bristles on the small hand-held rotating brush attachment are softer. Why they didn't just use the same bristles on the main brush, I do not know.  The plastic wands are the flimsiest I've ever seen on any vac, even a cheap one. They bend all over the place if you put any pressure on them. I could duct tape cardboard paper towel tubes together and have a more sturdy wand than the one that comes with this vac.  The "Intelliclean" feature is a truly bizarre concept. The idea is that when the vac senses that no (or very little) dirt is being picked up it switches the suction (motor speed) to low. When it detects dirt being picked up again it switches the suction back up to high. The problem is, once it switches the suction to low it does a poor job of picking up larger pieces of dirt, like pine needles or bits of dried mud from shoes. So, after it switches the suction to low you can run the vac over pieces of dirt like that several times and it won't pick them up. Of course it won't switch the suction back to high, which it would need to do in order to pick up the dirt, because it doesn't detect any dirt being picked up, because it switched the suction to low ... This is truly a "feature" that serves no useful purpose to anyone outside of Kenmore's marketing department.  You can't lay the vac down flat to vacuum under things. Once you tilt the body back more than about 60-70 degrees the front lifts off the ground, so it's no longer picking up dirt. (I had an old Hoover that would lay all the way flat and still keep the carpet brushes on the floor. You could lay it down and vacuum under the bed with it. There's no way you could do that with this vac.) In order to vacuum all the way under things you have to pull out the hose and attachments, and if you're on a rug or carpet, you're stuck with the tiny Handi-Mate Jr. rotating brush attachment. It is near worthless for areas of any significant size, with a pickup width of barely three inches. It's like trying to paint your house with a one inch wide brush. After running it back and forth several dozen times you'll be inclined to say the heck with it, the dirt's under the couch so no one will see it and you have better things to do with your time.  The hose attaches to the vacuum rather high up on the body, so when you try to stretch the hose to its rated length the vacuum tends to fall over on its side. Not a good thing when your house if furnished with antique furniture. If the designers had attached the hose lower (below the center of gravity) it would have been better.  Someone else noted their difficulty in using this vac on small throw rugs, and I've had the same problem. Even with the brush height all the way up and the suction on low it still wants to eat throw rugs, and the rear wheels won't roll smoothly from a hard floor up onto a throw rug. Given the heavy weight of the vac, the rear wheels should be larger diameter so they would roll over offsets in the floor more easily.  Bottom line, I'll be doing most of the vacuuming using my Electrolux Sanitaire Commercial canister vac (http://www.amazon.com/Electrolux-Sanitaire-SC3683A-Commercial-Canister/dp/B0006HUYTE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1234749076&sr=8-1) which is so light and compact you can put a luggage strap on and hang it on your shoulder - no dead weight to push back and forth or drag behind you. Only problem is it doesn't have a rotating carpet brush, so I'll be stuck wrestling the Kenmore beast when I do the carpet.  To be fair, there are some good things about this vacuum. If you're a professional football player or bodybuilder and you want vacuuming to involve an upper body workout, this is the vac for you. You'll definitely build your biceps yanking this monster back and forth around the house. It also seems to do a very good to excellent job pulling dirt out of carpets. If you have a house with large, open, carpeted areas this may be a good vac for you. And the 30 foot long cord is really, really nice. I have to give Kenmore credit for eliminating my need for an extension cord (which I've had to use with every other vac I've owned). The long cord also makes this vac useful as a boat anchor in water up to 30 feet deep.
It's too heavy and not mobile at all. It takes ages to get cord plugged and so on.
Not Your Parent's Electrolux  The unit is quiet and has good suction. But, there is a defect in its design. The neck at the power head is made of plastic and broke soon after we started using the product. The neck has to be able to swivel and withstand pushing across the floor. It quickly develops cracks and breaks. The out-source service department in New Albany was extremely slow and ineffective. Electrolux sent a replacement power head, but it was the wrong one. The whole purchase has been quite frustrating, especially in light of the fact that our previous unit, which included metal parts, lasted over 30 years.
Not worth even the cheap price  Motor runs hot and shuts off after just a few minutes use. This is a piece of junk
Vacuum is heavy and hard to use.  This vacuum has terrific suction but I bought it because it was advertised as lightweight.  It is very heavy and had I not thrown out the box in came in I would have returned it .
Dyson DC41 Uprights  Not worth the money!  Very poorly designed for every day use.  The good,  lots of suction and easy to steer around objects.  The bad, very cheap on-off switch.  It shuts off right after you push the switch to turn it on.  You need to hit it with a hammer to get the switch to function.  The mechanism to operate the handle (lock back in upright position) works maybe 10% of the time.  If you look at it, or even breath the handle falls down and the vacuum tips over.  Don't even think about trying to move the vacuum in the upright position.  For the money they charge they are not worth the frustration of poorly designed vacuums.  Apparently who ever designed them never tried to use them.
Suction? What suction? It doesn't even pick up a small leaf!  Soooo disappointed. I was giddy with excitement when I first turned it on. It was easy to assemble, self-propelled so nicely, collection cup was easy to dump, and it has a long cord. But then I used it and my bubble was burst. This thing wouldn't pick up a small leaf! I guess it will work if all you have is dirt and a few tiny dust bunnies but I have two cocker spaniels and a cockatoo so this machine is no match for my carpeting. I'll go back to my big, old Bissell and search for something that is truly suited for a home with pets.
Can a vacuum be a lemon?  We purchased this vacuum because we live in an old two-story house with wood floors, and lightweight vacuum was just what we needed.  After only a couple of months, the machine began shutting down randomly during use. We notified the manufacturer (since we were outside of amazon's 30-day return period), and they replaced the machine. Now after only a few more months, the new machine is doing the same thing. It has a five-year warranty, but we blanche at the prospect of returning and replacing it every few months for the life of the warranty. We're stuck with a $250 purchase that's a total lemon.
Disappointing -- Design has changed so it ONLY works on hardwood floors or NO-nap rugs.  CHEAP switch & hose frustrating too!  First off, let me say that I have owned Mighty Mites for over 15 years.  I've loved them.  My first one lasted for 12 years and was a workhorse.  My second lasted only 3 years but that was because my child broke a wheel off of it (long story).  So when I had to find a replacement, I immediately just looked for another Mighty Mite.  Didn't even shop around.  And then I discovered that they had changed some things since my last model and I have to say I'm sorely disappointed it.  [Edited to add - be sure to read through the bottom - it's only 5 months later and it has broken to the point that it is going out to the trash)  The new design of the floor attachment only works on perfectly flat floors (hardwood, linoleum, no-nap rugs) and only if you use it with the bristles retracted.  One reason I loved my past Mighty Mites was that a) I could use it in all my rooms, including the one room with a low-nap carpeting and another room with a slightly shaggy rug, and b) I could extend the bristles on the bottom of the floor attachment and those would catch all the long hairs my daughters shed!  What I discovered is that if you try to use it with the bristles extended on something with a low-nap, the floor attachment becomes angled in such a way that pushing it forward becomes 3x as hard as before, AND it looses almost all suction when you start to pull it back.  The attachment actually bounces up off the ground as you pull it back!  There is no way to have a smooth back-and-forth rhythm... it's PUSH HARD, and then pull back until ACK! it jumped over the spot it needed to vacuum so do that part again.  I had not yet thrown away my old Might Mite and so I tried the old floor attachment hooked up to this canister.  Everything worked perfectly.  So I can say that this canister has good suction power...  I called Eureka customer support to see if I had just gotten a defective model, and while he was very sympathetic to my problems, he made it clear that this was just how the floor attachments are designed now.  He had me try it on the carpeting without the bristles extended, and it solved the problem of the attachment being hard to push... because now it was lightly rolling along with the feel of no suction in BOTH directions.  :(  He said that they made the new attachments lighter and that was probably why I was having these problems and that he had heard this from other customers as well.  UGH.  I will share a few of the other design changes as well:  On the old Mighty Mite, you included two long hard plastic tubes to create the 'wand' that allowed you to stand and vacuum.  I liked that if I needed to vacuum something nearer, I could pop off one (or both) of the tubes to use it for things like stairs or cobwebs in the basement ceiling, etc.  The new Mighty Mite use a single metal, telescoping wand.  This has the advantage that you can adjust it in smaller increments... so if you are slightly taller or shorter than the average person, you can make it the right height for you to do the floors.  And you can adjust it down to half-length so it (in essense) can work on the same jobs where you'd use just one tube from the old model.  One down side, though, is that it is a lot heavier.  If you often used the old wand for overhead work, you're going to find your arms getting a lot more tired with this model.  Finally, they changed the on-off switch.  It used to be mechanical -- there was a tactile sensation and a 'click' that went with turning it on.  The new switch LOOKS the same but doesn't work the same.  You start to press it and the machine is suddenly on.  But if you haven't pressed it long enough, then the machine might turn off when you take your finger (or foot) away.  So then you do it again.  It may be that we'll get used to it, but I asked each member of the family to try the new vacuum (without telling them my thoughts) and everyone disliked the new switch.  This model still has good suction and is lightweight/maneuverable.  As several reviewers have noted, the hose is lightweight and can kink easily but my second Mighty Mite was like that so I was used to that.  My plan is to use my old floor attachment with the new vacuum... and when this one dies someday, I guess I'll be shopping around and trying out a few different models.  [Added Jan 27, 2016... wow, 5 months later and I'm already having to buy a new vacuum.  The cheap hose started to kink more and more frequently, until it was literally kinking right by the handle every single time I pulled back on it.  This became SO aggravating that I pressed down hard on the power switch (the same one no one in my family liked) and apparently broke it.  BUYER BEWARE -- the reviews from years past where this was a GOOD product no longer apply since Eureka has changed so many of the parts to cheaper pieces of junk!]
I charged both batteries and it worked great.  Once the battery needed to be replaced with the second battery, it was impossible to remove from the vacuum.  Finally after removing the battery, and replacing with the newly charged battery, then it would not come on.  So, with the issue of the second battery not working but was fully charged, and being very difficult removing the battery, I would not recommend this vacuum.
POOR QUALITY  I PURCHASED THIS VACUUM IN MARCH OF 2011. THE PLASTIC HOSE THAT GOES INTO THE VACUUM HAS COME OUT AND HAVE HAS DUCT TAPE HOLDING IT ON.  I FEEL THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN OF A BETTER QUALITY. NOW, I WILL HAVE TO ORDER A NEW VACUUM CLEANER.  VERY POOR QUALITY!!!!!!!!  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM FOR PURSCHASE!!!!
Inexpensive, bad around cabinets and fails very early.  Avoid this one.  We have used this vacuum a total of maybe 20 times since this was purchased 4 months ago.  Major flaws: Does not get under a standard cabinet all the way to the kick plate; you know, where most of the dirt and grime tends to hang out. No longer operates after minimal use.  The upside: It is inexpensive and has OK initial quality for carpeted floors where maneuvering around and under cabinetry is not a concern.
Has lost suction power and randomly shuts off.
LOW QUALITY  WOW.  This is so flimsy.  The nozzle broke right off trying to use it.  Of course, I don't have the receipt any more.  At least I didn't pay a lot for it.  I would steer clear.
Don't waste your money on this one.  I bought this vacuum and it worked for 8 months before it broke down. The shortest lifespan for the most expensive vacuum I have purchased equals the worst purchase ever. I bought an Oreck because my mom had one for a long time so I thought it was a good deal. NOPE! Not sure if its worth getting fixed . . . we will see.
Very shoddy service  Windtunnel worked great first 10 minutes I used it, The clip holding the vacum tube going to beater brush is broke. I had to duck tape it. When I told Amazon about it, they wanted me to pay for shipping up front.  Thing is still taped.  Not doing this again.  St. Wx
Would not reccomend this vacuum!!!  Like one of the previous reviewers, I have never written a review before.  I absolutely HATE this vacuum.  It clogs all too often and does not have the suction my old hoover had.  When dumping the canister out, the dust you have collected spills everywhere.  So much for those who have allergies.  Then I spent some time cleaning out the canister (I like the bag method better). My old hoover was 14 years old an sucked a lot better than this one!!!  We donated the old one.  Should have donated this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Broke down shortly after  year of use
Horrible, did not suck up at all- sent it back
Not a good buy!  What a shame! I wasted my money!!! The vacuum is defective and it has taken a little while to see that ... it does not seal correctly and thus lets dirt in all around the bag ... Even though I use amazon a lot this is the last time I will make a large purchase because if the product becomes defective there is no one to return it to ...
Worked for the first 3 times.  I really needed a backpack vacuum that would function as a normal vacuum for an office carpet. After 3 times the attachment for the carpet stopped spinning and the overall suction was not working. I changed the bag (though it was only half full), but it didn't seem to help. I will be returning this.
Would not recommend this vacuum  Reasoning: The vacuum suction in the extension is fine, but the upright sweeper, in my opinion, does not have enough weight on the front suction area for it to really deep clean into your carpet, seems to just glide over, even when the brushes are free and cleaned
Doesn't pick up most particles or pet hair.  My whole house is tile so I thought this was a great solution.  Was very disappointed about the vacuum capability. It does NOT pick up ANY large particles like small leaves. Seems to only pick up dust or very small particles.  Pet hair just clumps at the entrance. It also is noisy. What a waste of money!
this vacum is heavy  the weight of this vacuum is toward the upper half so it has to be held up  and the rotator part is only if you turn the upper half side to side yourself!  If you have any kind of back injury this is not the vacuum for you.my old kirby vacuum is superior for ease of use and suction I was looking for a wand style , light weight for multiple uses.,this is not it
I bought one of these from Amazon in Canada to help keep our two bedroom condo in Montreal clean.  This is an utterly useless device.  The hand vac that forms the core of this device has an air inlet with a dog leg in it and a flap, which means if you try and pick up anything but dust (something it's not particularly effective at) it will clog and become useless.  As an example, when I empty the document shredder in my office, some bits fall out - this will pick them up and clog.  You then need a long pipe cleaner (who has those anymore?) or a stick to pick out the debris caught in the inlet channel.  Suction power is laughable as is the battery life.  I accept that an inexpensive vacuum won't perform like a Dyson, but I expect to get more than a joke in a box.  A product like this tells you a lot about what Bisselll think of their customers....
Horrible Squealing Noise  I'm not sure if this is common to this machine or just the one I received but it made a horrible, high pitched squealing noise when in use. I had to wear ear plugs in order to vacuum and eventually had to get rid of it due to noise complaints in my housing complex.
Good while it lasted  I had this unit for almost exactly 2 years before it broke. You are purchasing a disposable cleaner as Hoover does not make replacement parts for it. Be advised. The water intake hose became brittle and cracked open. I spent 10 minutes waiting for Hoover to answer the phone. They then advised me that my cleaner will need to be taken in to an authorized repair place. She proceeded to provide me with the repair place's phone number. Never once did she think to mention that this vacuum is intentionally a disposable model. Hoover does not and never has made replacement parts for it. So I had to call the repair place to find this out for myself. He says that Hoover was sold to China sometime ago and now has horrible customer service. He said that many of these types of vacuums are now being made to be disposable. The repair expert told me that this goes for pretty much every brand now. The problem is that they only last for about a year. I got 2 years out of mine so I consider myself lucky. The best advice is to purchase a floor cleaner at Sam's Club or Costco. That way right before the thing is a year-old you can return it and get a new one.
The suction is amazing BUT it is so heavy and so unwieldy that I am literally sore after using it. It is poorly balanced and I just noticed that I also have cuts on my hand from fighting with it. The tubing is very short so using the attachments is nearly impossible. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED.
Canister is a major pain to empty  The bag less canister on this vacuum is worthless. I loved everything about this vacuum, it sucks well, stores easily, awesome retractable cord, and picks up pet fur very well; however the canister is impossibly difficult to empty. We constantly have to open the whole thing and take out the filter and clean it jut to get the dirt out. The quick release thing doesn't work because the dirt just stays stuck, even if you vigorously shake it (which just gets the dirt all over the floor instead of the trash can) we even tried getting a dish brush to scoop out the diet when we use it, but it still doesn't help. I really want to like this vacuum but that canister is such a pain!
it was suppose to be a refurbished machine.  it was suppose to be a refurbished machine.  It was broken when we received it and had to return it
Caveat Emptor!!!!!  I'd give it ZERO stars but that wasn't an option  If the retracting cord binds (and the vacuum is out of warranty), plan on throwing the unit away.  I probably used this machine a couple dozen times when the cord pulled part way out and jammed. Trying to open the clamshell to free the cord proved to be a nightmare.  There are some screws visible. The trick is there's one screw hidden, and it can only be accessed by pushing in on a section of the back panel to expose the head.(The only reason for doing this is to generate income for the service center)  There are muliple printed circuit boards inside and the point to point wiring between these PCB's is design for the unit to be serviced by a robot not a human.  After getting the unit open it was obvious little plastic supports that hold the retracting reel together were sheared off, that resulted in the cable turning into a rats nest.  The design of this vacuum is intended to ensure a healthy income for people at the the Bosch sevice center.  I really liked this vacuum until this situation occurred. At this point it's headed to the dumpster....
this is the worst vacuum I ever seen - very cheap made product  this is the worst vacuum I ever seen - very cheap made product. someone need to investigate the good reviews.
Worst vacuum/ customer service ever!  Electrolux will be glad to know I'm not returning my vacuum for the forth time to be repaired. I gave it away and purchased a shark. This is part of the free advertisement I promised you wouldn't want. No more Electrolux for me...
Misery in vacuum form.  If I wasn't a broke college student, this thing would be on the front lawn and I'd be in the car heading to the store to get a new vacuum. I have two cavalier king charles spaniels and a siamese cat. I HAVE A LOT OF PET HAIR IN MY HOUSE!! There are two major problems with this vacuum:  1) The dirt cup looks big, but the USEABLE space in the dirt cup is TINY. The "max fill" line is about 3-4 inches from the bottom. I can vacuum about 1/2 of my living room before I have to stop and dump out the dust cup. If you don't stop often and dump out the dirt/hair/yucky, the hair clogs up in the dirt cup and filter, and you have to get a screwdriver or fork or tongs or some other device to pull all the hair out that gets stuck in the top of the cup. It's really an awful setup, and very very dirty to try and clean out.  2) The hose attachment is ridiculously short. It extends about 2 feet, and the attachments are short. Really makes it tough to get the pet hair out of all the corners.  I wouldn't wish this vacuum on anyone.
Not for hard floors  I have a dog, 2 cats, small kids and mostly hardwoods and area rugs.  I bought this vacuum based on Consumer Reports high rating for my needs.  The self propelled function works great in the one room with wall to wall carpet, but on the tile and hard woods, the vacuum is careening out of control. It sounds like a screeching race car and then bumps hard into my furniture and molding along the walls.  It already has numerous scratch and scuff marks and we just can't control it well.  I switched from a 10 year old Oreck and was used to holding the baby while I vacuumed so she wouldn't be afraid of the noise.  This one is so ridiculously loud, I think the neighbors can tell I'm vacuuming.  The pet hair attachment works well, but the powerful suction sucks the short hose even shorter so you have to really use some muscle to get it to the couch.  The suction is great on the vacuum in general.  I also don't really appreciate the clean and dirty lights because the "dirty" light remains on even on a brand new area rug.  Noise and steering are the biggest reasons that I would not recommend this vacuum and I'm buying a different one after only 6 months.
find a different brand -Has great suction when it does  -keeps breaking -Cheap plastic parts -bolts on drivetrain keep coming loose -Constant maintenance required, find a different brand -Has great suction when it does work
I love the concept of this machine but this was the second one that I have purchased and it is already dead. Not going to buy a third
Not as good as they used to be  I have had 2 Dyson's for the last 15 years and they were great. This one I got in April and it's July now and won't work. Constantly overheats and shuts down. We only have 3 rooms with carpet anyway....??!!! So, the older models were great, this one not so much. I would not buy one again!!!
Item was not as represented  I chose this item partially because of the on board duster. The vacuum works well but did not have the on board duster. The number on the box matches the model number, but it is a different item than pictured and described.
Quite disappointing with suction!  I purchased this vacuum after first trying out the Hoover Bagless Turbo 5290-900. I was really impressed with the 5290-900; it was quite impressive on carpet, but the brush roll didn't turn off for hard floor and it blew all the dirt around. So I exchanged it for this model; thought I'd bought the best out there. This vacuum - the 6430-900 - is Consumer Reports best buy. However, when I tried out this vacuum, it did poorly on carpet and hard floors! I had to push it back and forth about 10 times in some spots with light dirt - it just wasn't picking up. I reread the manual, checked the bag and hoses for leaks; nothing. My husband was equally frustrated with how this vacuum "didn't work". It just didn't seem to have the power of the cheaper model. And the extra (impressive-looking) brush roll hand tool attachment was disappointing. Unless you move it lightly against your furniture/stairs, the roll stops. Now what good is that? How can it clean well if it's either "sweeping" the surface, or - when pressed harder - not rolling? I returned this vacuum, and replaced it with a Panasonic upright from Best Buy that I am totally impressed with!
On off switch broke!  Beware! On off switch broke machine would not cut off unless unplugged. The place they recommended based on my zip code still has my vacuum and it's been about 2 weeks. :-(
Not so great disappointed with the power.
Bissell 16N5F,is no match for its predecessor.  My 6100E eventually died but it was built like a battle ship and its performance was second to none.,which is the reason that I purchased another Bissell. I have just received The 16N5F and I am very disappointed in the build quality, which is much cheaper than its predecessor .The air brush is a pathetic and all all, I do not think it was worth the bother of importing into the UK.
I've tried to use it 3 times and it keeps dying and all the pet hair dumps on the floor.  It's going in the trash.
Do not buy  I wish I hadn't purchased this vacuum. My 11-year-old, broken Dyson works better than this. Additionally, the hose attachment is inconvenient to use and has to be attached every time you use it.
Very light plastic-built.  The attachment items do not stay in place.  Very heavy.  Would not buy again!
I ordered this machine in March 2015. I loved it & so did the woman that helps me with my cleaning. She liked it so much that she asked me to order it for her this month. Unfortunately a week later she was getting ready to use mine in my home & the machine didn't turn on. Checked everything on the machine; changed electrical outlet twice...still no power. Called the 800 number on the machine...they gave me a local vacuum dealer & said they will repair it or give me a new machine. I took it into the vacuum dealer they recommended. They told me that they have 2 or 3 of these machines come in every week. They just aren't making them the way they used to & was told the older models were more reliable. They will do a rush on my machine to determine the problem but I'm not very optimistic that I won't be putting out more money to replace this machine. I feel bad that I ordered one for my cleaning woman. I will say that when it was working it was great at cleaning my wood floors but not a good value since it stopped working after only 3 months. I suggest you go to your local vacuum dealer & get demonstrations. I relied on Amazon because I have difficulty getting out due to arthritis.
The attachments on this are useless, unless you don't mind carrying the entire vacuum with you, or dragging it along side as you do area rugs with furniture piece. Its a nightmare. It does however, have great suction. Takes the area rugs right up off the floor and into the sweeper.
Poor canister design  This vacuum performs well, until you try to empty the canister.  Opening the bottom will release loose dirt, but if you have pets it won't release anything.  All the hair stays in the canister and it will take several minutes (and small hands) to get it out.  Also, reaching your hand in the canister can result in DANGEROUS levels of static electricity release, so I would recommend wearing rubber gloves.  Not recommended for anyone with pets.
Not good for carpet  I purchased this vacuum to replace my 10 year old Mighty Mite which had weak suction.  I needed a vacuum that would be light weight yet powerful enough to pick up pet hair. This vacuum has powerful suction but does not pick up pet hair.  In fact, it is no good on carpet at all and too strong for area rugs.  It is also heavier than my previous vacuum.  The biggest problem is the attachments.  The carpet attachment is poor and to obtain a rotating roller brush for the carpet is almost $100!!!!
loud as hell  Good suction. very easy to put together. it is loud as hell though.  Suction is becoming a problem. So loud
Don't buy it!  This was given to me as a christmas gift.  It worked fine for the first 3 months, then the belt went out.  The belt and filter have to be changed every 3 months or so, depending on usage.  There is no indicator of when things need to be changed, you'll find out when it stops working right.  Like others have said this vacuum will only last you a couple of years if you are lucky.  Its been a little over a year and it starting making a loud noise.  Be prepared to buy another one after a year.
I hate this vacuum.  So I bought this thing in 2013. I hate it. I had to replace the motor because it blew up one day, apparently from not cleaning the filter. What? Now the power button doesn't work, you plug it in and it turns on, and to turn it off you have to unplug it. The brush part scratches my bamboo floors and the suction-powered brush doesn't turn on or off when you want it to. When the motor blew up, I contacted customer service and they wouldn't give me a replacement, i had to buy it myself. It's too expensive considering everything is made out of plastic. I'm going to buy a Shark now, and I also have a Roomba which is really good.
Wouldn't recommend  Purchased this for my small business only for reception area and a couple small offices.  Wand attachment never worked with any suction at all and the vacuum itself has no suction at all after using only a few times!!!  Purchased this based upon the "Electrolux" name and branding.  Will never try another product of theirs now.
Horrible performance  I have 4 small kids and a living room that opens directly to the backyard, so as you can imagine, I need good suction. I purchased this Dyson nearly 3 years ago. I was quite impressed the first year or so, especially compared to the $30 vacuum I had previously. But overtime, it lost its suction power. I troubleshooted with the help line, made sure everything was clear, and that didn't help. For example, my toddler crushed Cheez-it's on the carpet and I went over it 20+ times, and you could still see crumbs jumping around.  Finally a few months ago, I went and bought a Shark Navigator. First I thoroughly vacuumed with the Dyson, then used the Shark. The amount of dust, dirt and fuzz that pulled up was disgusting.  So I called to have the Dyson checked out. Received it less than a week later (thumbs up on that part!) and the notes said it checked ok. Once again did the whole living room with the Dyson, followed by the Shark, and once again got lots of nastiness. They had me send it in again. I just got it back the 2nd time, and it still doesn't work properly. The notes say they were unable to duplicate the problem. Well, I'm sure if they are just comparing the suction of this to another of the same crappy vacuum, it probably works fine. But this is unacceptable to me. Now I have an unusable pile of junk with 2 years of warranty left. I can't in good conscience sell it. On the other hand, how do you just throw away something that cost nearly $500 after only 3 years? So it will sit in my garage until I can bring myself to take it to the dump.  Extremely disappointed in my Dyson. I do highly recommend the Shark Navigator (the white one), but we will have to see how that holds up over time. Even if it lasts less than 3 years, it was only 1/3 the cost.  UPDATE!  After posting this review, Dyson finally agreed to send me a refurbished machine. I begrudgingly agreed, because as it was my unit was inoperable, but at least it had a couple more years warranty unlike the refurbished ones. They sent me the orange DC25 instead of the purple one I had. It does pick up much better than my old one. However, it is clearly old and has lots of quirks. The ball is really dingy, it squeaks in use, the canister falls off if barely bumped. I am not impressed. I plan on sending this one in because this is not a good replacement for my machine. All I ask for is a vacuum that WORKS and is in good shape like my original!!
Too powerful for small scatter rugs  This vac will eat small rugs that have a rubber backing and the company agrees.  I am very disappointed that I have to use another vac to clean those rugs which did fine with an Bissell upright vac.  It is also loud and heavy.  I do not recommend this vac.
Mine must be a dud  I've had the vacuum two months and it has stopped working. I loved it for the month and a half that it worked properly. Just started making a funny noise, thought maybe I picked up something that got caught up somewhere. Took it all apart according to intstructions. Didn't find anything other than dust and pet hair.noise got worse and it is definitely not picking up anything anymore. Return window is 30 days. I'm highly disappointed to have spent so much and received so little.
I can not recommend this  sent back for repair, 3 times. Normally an LG fan, I have bought other LG appliances ( Microwave, fridge, dish washer). I can not recommend this vacuum
Bad customer service....faulty device  Don't know about anyone else but since I had it, it has been leaving puddles on my floor after each use. I called  Hoover and eventually got a live person, but hey want me to drive a half hour to a certified Hoover dealer/technician to have them look at it to tell them what's wrong with it. Then give them a call back when I have something written in hand saying the problem. Only problem is there is no one in my area who is certified with hoover. And even if I were to spend the time to go do this they are going to charge me to look at it. $30! I paid 90. So I am frustrated.
brush width to narrow  This floor-mate was designed to clean large areas yet the brushes only measure 11 inches across what were they thinking. Using this is like mowing a large lawn with a small lawnmower. Otherwise the machine works well.
I guess my review is very poor in taking that long to get this merchandise  my review? Why am I being asked for a review, when it was going to take some 6 weeks to get this vacuum, and there is still 2 weeks left before we will supposedly see this..... I guess my review is very poor in taking that long to get this merchandise, and then poor, in Amazon not knowing that  As to the vacuum itself, this will be my third one like this, one I use at home, and 2 others for cleaning at an office building, so having bought that many because I was satisfied and then buying another after some 5 years since the one I am replacing, I would say the vacuum itself is very good. I will NEVER buy another bagless units. they just don't do the job one like this can do, and for the price, is well worth it. I paid much higher for other units like Bissell and Dyson, and will take this one over either of those any day of the week.
Did not last long before having problems  I have had this vaccumm for 18 months now.  It is very loud, The front debris container's button to open and clean it out became unstable in less than 1 year. The front container keeps falling off.  Then it stopped cleaning linolium and low floors.  Now it's not picking up anything and I have to call my brother to see if he can fix it.  When I bought this I expected it to last at least 3 years without breaking down. I do not recommed this product.
The hose sucks  The hose is so flimsy that it constantly kinks
Wait for the next model  I bought this thinking I would save space and money buying just one vacuum for my hard wood and carpeted floors.  I tend to go through vacuums quickly (3 vacuums in 3 years) but Hoover is always highly rated so I thought this would be a good choice.  It is cool and new but it isn't proven.  The belt broke on the first one (that is one of their selling points, you don't have to replace belts or filters) in the first month but we were still under warranty, so they replaced it.  Six months later while vacuuming it shot out a fire ball across my floor and wouldn't work so (thank goodness, still under warranty) we took it in to be repaired for free; although you have to take it to certain "authorized" repair shops.  The first one refused to repair it because she didn't like it, so we had to drive to another state to get it repaired.  After the repair it lasted about six more months.  It now has no suction and won't even pick up dust bunnies .  We checked for blockages and we still can't get it to suck anything up.  Plus the hose broke so while your vacuuming it will unscrew from it's handle and snap back to the vacuum. Screws keep falling off of different sections and the pins that hold the accessories cover come out from the vacuum vibrations.  We no longer have a warranty though.  I will say that while it worked, it had great suction.  The very long hose was great.  It stores the attachment on it and it's bagless which means you can retrieve sucked up socks, coins and Bionicle parts when needed (I love that).  It is very, very, very heavy though (I think it may actually out weigh me?)  It's great concept, but it needs a lot more work to make it worth buying.  I am actually kind of embarrassed that I bought it when I could have bought a reliable, proven vacuum for half the price.
Please please Oreck read this. I couldn't find a contact seller option. A part broke within 5 min of operating. Can I exchange just this part for a new part?! (The floor sweeper attachment)  I would love to give 5 stars but cant with a product that breaks so quickly.  I love the power behind the suction of this vacuum. I love the attachments. It was initially uncomfortably heavy until I wore it like. Messenger bag inside of over one shoulder... then it was no problem.
Great vacuum that is too heavy to use  Great cleaning pwer for this bag using upright vacuum, but its 21 pound heft makes it very difficult to use. We returned it after one attempt at use.  We are fairly athletic people in our 50s, and we still found it difficult to push around.  The rollers should be motorized and the heft taken out of the upright canister to make this more user friendly.  BTW, Amazon sells the bags and belt for this vacuum cleaner, which we bought along with the vacuum.  The bags and blet come from a different vendor, and they do not accept returns. We are stuck with this stuff!!!
$1 hose will break and make this useless  After 15 months the hose that moves water to/from the tanks and the floor cracked in half making this unusable. So a $1 plastic hose can render this whole device useless.  I called Hoover and they tried blaming me about the types of cleaner I used.  I use their cleaner that I bought on Amazon.  Now they want me to drive 20 miles to the closest service center in the other side of Houston TX to drop this off to see if it even falls under warranty.  I'll probably just pay another website $5 to send me the part and install it myself because that'll be less hassle than dealing with repair people and Hoover again.
Terrible Vacuum for Rich People Who Don't Vacuum...  I cannot say enough BAD THINGS about this vacuum.  I would happily return to a heavy vacuum with a BAG that I have to change rather than use this any longer.  I've given it three years and it's been consistently horrible, from day 1.  DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM.  I don't know if any other Dyson vacuums might be better, but this is so horrible that I don't imagine I'll ever try another.  And, in case you're wondering, I bought it brand new from Bed Bath & Beyond (in the store, didn't even have it shipped to me), so it's an authentic, non-refurbished, damage-free product.  I don't care if this thing is bagless or cool looking or lightweight or has a washable filter.....IT DOESN'T SUCTION.  This vacuum can't and has never been able to pick up basic debris from any type of surface - hardwood, vinyl, tile, or low-pile carpet.  About every other time that I use this vacuum, I have to turn it off and take it apart to remove clogs of basic things that a vacuum is supposed to handle easily.  Never in my life have I done that with any other vacuum.  Dog hair?  Forget about it.  Sometimes I find myself vacuuming with one foot on top of the "head" thing to try and get it to connect better with the ground and suction better.  Christmas tree needles completely overwhelmed this vacuum - and I'm not talking anything egregious.  Just the amount you'd expect a tree to drop over the span of a couple of days.  I mean, it just can't pick up anything.  I use the nozzle attachments on my furniture - and then I have to go back over them with a lint roller to pick up everything this left behind.  Oh, and sometimes it just doesn't turn on.  We had this terrifying moment a couple of weeks ago.  We plugged it in, turned it on, and nothing happened.....HALF AN HOUR LATER, it suddenly turned on.  WTF???  I hate this so, so much.
Not good on stairs  Unfortunely there are no moving parts, so it does not scrub the carpet, YOU do. Then, the suction is very low, so it only takes up the surface,  and does not get the edges of the stair. It needs a full covering attanchment with moving brushes to do stairs, which is the area that gets the most dirt! Also, it takes up surface dirt, but not dirt in the carpet, so leaves large rings where dirt had been. Not useful.
Planned obsolescence at its finest. Does't work after 2 years  Planned obsolescence at its finest.  Does't work after 2 years.  It started to overheat little by little and now doesn't work at all.  Another piece of plastic in the landfill for the benefit of Eureka's wallet.  I will never buy their products again.
I wish that I had stayed with the canister vacuum and do not recommend this upright model  I replaced my Kenmore canister vacuum, which had given me many years of service with no problems, with this Kenmore model.  We moved into a house with wall-to-wall carpeting and based on Consumer Reports' high rating, I decided to purchase this upright vacuum.  It is on the heavy side, but the self-propelling feature helped a bit.  However, 9 months later, the self-propelling feature quit and now it's a chore to push this vacuum around.  Also, there no longer seems to be any difference between the floor and carpet suction levels.  I've cleaned out the brushes, changed the bag, etc., but nothing helps.  Several reviewers have also mentioned that the hose is too short for using the attachments.  I wish that I had stayed with the canister vacuum and do not recommend this upright model.
DON'T  After spending all that money on this vacuum, it does not clean even 50% as well as a cheaper Hoover.  DON'T MAKE THIS MISTAKE!
The motor seemed different than my last Hoover Tempo.  Seemed to have been made cheaper this time around.  Still works but just a different feel (cheaper)
Awful.  I purchased this as a replacement for our old Dyson that finally broke down after several years of service. I chose this specific vacuum because, on paper, it met all of our needs. Good on hardwood floors, good carpet settings, excellent with pet hair, etc.  And for the money, it seemed like a really good alternative to another Dyson.  Woeful.  I've had it for a month now and here is what's gone wrong:  1)  I needed an entirely new part sent to me because the vacuum would not stay powered on, right out of the box.  And dealing with Hoover's customer service department was less than a treat.  I'm not sure I've ever spoken with a group of people that hated life more than these guys... 2)  The suction is ridiculous on any setting for hardwood floors.  It forms such a suction grip on the floor that it is very difficult to push around and doesn't pick up a lot of the hair/dirt because it's too tightly attached to the floor. 3)  It makes a horrible squeaking racket every time we use it. 4)  The spinning brush up front, which one can supposedly turn off with a foot pedal so that you don't damage your hardwood floors, is ridiculous.  It "kind of works".  The brushes still spin and can cause scratching if you leave it in any one place for too long.  This is an awful vacuum and I wish that I had never purchased it.  A new Dyson isn't doable from a cost-perspective, so I'll have to replace it with a Shark or a Bissell.
disappointed with attachments  I bought this dyson today and am seriously disappointed in it.  The salesperson at Sears told me that I could buy any other attachments for it from the company themselves (since it only comes with the three standard attachments that fit on the body of the machine).  The attachments that Sears sells for the DC14 models do not fit the DC15 (the wand is smaller at the top where they attach..I was told it was a design change).  Anyway, I called Dyson when I got home with my new machine.. and while I was happy that it can now fit under the lip of my cabinets in the kitchen and hallway I was extremely disappointed to find out that they do not intend to make any attachements for the DC15 other then the floor tool and the mini-turbine head.  The customer service rep that i had spoken with initially said that these were expected to be out in the fall..but then later on the in the coversation said that she didn't know when they would be out.  Though the new machine can reach further under furniture then the older models, it still can't reach fully under.  As a "work around"  they told me that I could attach the flat attachment to the hose and lean under the furniture to clean.  I think that I am going to return this model and get one of the older ones...I certainly wish that I knew this before today...and I certainly wish that the Sears sales reps knew what their products.
Doesn't suck.  Can't wait to get rid of it.  We have hardwood and vinyl floors with area rugs. This vacuum manouvers like most uprights; I had no trouble using it.  The light mounted on the head is a nice feature.  The filter is awesome too.  However... it does not have the suction I was expecting.  The upright does not even come close to cleaning the toe-kick area under the kitchen or bathroom cabinets, making it necessary to use the little over-the-shoulder canister every time you vacuume the floors.  The upright will reach a fair distance under the bed, however once again it does not have the suction power I was expecting and will not suck up a dust bunny that is right next to the head; it only picks up what is directly under the head.  Not a bad machine; I have used worse, but I am disappointed and considering returning it. UPDATE:  After having used this vacuum a few more times, I have decided to get rid of it and purchase an Electrolux.  This Hoover spits things out the back, just does not have enough suction in the upright or the canister.  I think I'll donate it to GoodWill, or just toss it in the landfill.
Very good suction but not very user friendly  Very good suction but not very user friendly. Hose is too short for comfortable operation. Floor brush does not operate properly as it spins very slowly or not at all. The belt could be stretched out but should have lasted longer. Will try a different brand next time.
After one year, would not hold a charge  Lightweight and easy to use.  Brush is hard to clean but the dust bin and filter are reasonably easy to empty and wash.  I liked it, but the battery died after one year.
Hoover sucks  Hoover has made it completely the worst experience for me I have ever had with any purchase.  My vacuum broke within the manufacturers warranty, the agents were so lazy and gave me such a hard time when i tried to return it.  I did every single thing they asked and then they gave me a location to have it fixed that was 2 hrs away. i asked if there was something closer, they said nothing in Columbus, did my own search and 3 listings came up immediately.  I will never purchase from Hoover again.  They also told me I would have to cover any charges by location for cleaning if I didn't do it correctly. I am not a hoover expert so basically I have to pay for something if i followed their directions and it wasn't done correctly. Horrible experience, do not even waste your time nor money on this worthless company.
Agitator Cuts In and Out  Got the product today, put it together and started using it. When the agitator works, it is a great vacuum. But the agitator stops randomly when vacuuming and the button has to be pressed to maybe get it going again. This happens roughly every 5 to 10 seconds while using the product. I called Dyson, and I have to bring the vacuum in for repair 45 minutes away, and then drive back out again later to pick it up.
Too much noise and stop working because the thermal protector last only 15 minutes and you need to wait 30 minutes to continue vacuum.
it doesn't get in the grout takes to long
Undependable but...  I have a Floormate Deluxe Model FH40160,  which I purchased from Amazon on February 11, 2017.  It has only been used occasionally as it was purchased for our retirement home in Florida, possibly 10 uses at most.  It did clean well when it was functioning-I liked it because fresh cleaning solution is dispensed and then the dirty water is vacuumed up.  So much better than the others types with pads, whether steam or fluid- with those I felt as if I needed multiple pads to get the floor clean and not just be redistributing the dirt around to dry elsewhere on the floor.  A month or so ago, the water dispensing capability slowed significantly.  Ten days ago, I turned it on and it immediately shut down and would not turn on.  I contacted several repair services in my area and have been told that it is not worth repairing, to quote one of the Hoover recommended agents, "It is perfectly engineered to fail".  I am extremely disappointed in Hoover as I have been a long time user of their products.  On the bright side, the last repair service told me that there is a 2 year warranty on my unit.  I have contacted Hoover to get it repaired or replaced and will post the outcome of that inquiry.  August 2018 update... Following the advice of the repair shop, I contacted Hoover and they replaced the unit because it was within the 2 year warranty.  Hoover provided shipping labels for the return of the faulty Floormate and shipped out a new (refurbished?) unit.  The only downside is that Hoover does not restart the warranty-the replacement unit is under the original warranty, but it's better than nothing!!! Not sure that I will buy another Floormate when this one dies.  The repair shop favors steamers (with lots of washable clothes, as they feel that if you have a lot of tile (we do!), the clothes need to be changed out multiple times to really get the floor clean.
5 on carpet, 0 on hard floors  I love this vacuum when I'm using it on carpet BUT I hate it when I move to hard surfaces. On carpet, it gets tons of dirt and pet hair and leaves leaves the room smelling cleaner. On hardwood floors and tile it's the worst thing ever. It has a switch to turn off the brushes once you're on a hard surface, but even then, it just spits every piece of dirt or hair out the sides or behind the vacuum. So what you end up doing is getting out the attachments and the hose (which is way too short for some reason) and doing the entire room by hand with a tiny yellow wand. The hose looks like it can stretch out really far but when you're using it it coils back up and the vacuum moves along with it instead of staying in one place. One cool feature is the rewind cord but you have to pull it all the way out before using the vac. or else the cord gets super hot inside the canister. I don't think it would cause a fire or anything but it's kinda weird how hot it gets.
Worked great for 1 month before dying.  I received the Floormate Deluxe Hard Floor Cleaner on July13th.  I loved it for the first month (about 6 uses).  On August 13th, the start button stopped working!  Now if I want to use it, I have to lean down and use one hand to hold the start button in as I try to use my other hand to press the trigger and steer it!  Not very useful now.  Unfortunately, my 30 day window to return to Amazon was closed.  I contacted Hoover.  They emailed back and told me to take it to an authorized Hoover repair place.  I finally had a day available to take it, but the repair place told me that it could take months to repair since they would have to go through Hoover to diagnose the problem and send the needed parts if it even repairable!  I need a cleaner now...not months from now!  and if it is repairable, how long will the repair work.  I am very disappointed!
Scratches, Hard to Clean Canister  SCRATCHES the Hard Wood Floors. They claim it doesn't, and it has felt wheels which is why I bought it. Well, sorry 4 wheels are plastic and two tiny ones are felt. That's six wheels that make indentations and marks in the floors. :/Suction- It couldn't pick up a small pebble, dragged it across the floor making a huge scratch. :)Quite operation sound! Seriously, is it on?! This is its only plus! :(Small container which is hard to clean out all the dust and dirt due to the compact design. $$Want to return but too far past the purchase date:( Waste of Money.
The wand didn't work at all.  Sent it back.
Thge Best Piece of Floors Equipment I Have Ever Seen  UPDATE: THIS WORKED LIKE 6 TIMES AND NO LONGER WORKS. . This thing is very well and simply designed and performs for me as advertised. My tiles are hard to wash because of the large and sunken grouting, but this machine gets in there, cleans, and sucks up the dirty water. It's also easy to push over wet surfaces, and is easy on the old back. It is easy to switch back and forth between modes with a simple swith. The on-off switch is covered in rubber. It comes with brushes for wood and tiled floors. I recommend this without reservation.
PIECE OF JUNK!  This machine will do well on everyday carpet jobs but.....Forget about cleaning up after pets.  Anytime it's turned off after sucking up cat litter it will dump it back out on the floor.  Hardly any litter ever makes it into the dirt cup.  Also, it does a horrible job on hard floors.  Just spits everything all over the place with brushes on and totaly misses dirt with brushes off.  I have a $35 battery dirt devil which blows the Eurkea away on hard floors, lol.
So disappointed!  I have had this vacuum since February without any issues. Now, out of the blue, its "bare floor setting" will not work AT ALL. Zero suction. The carpet setting still works, but I don't have carpet in my home. Only hardwood floors and laminate. I have tried everything I can find to fix it. I cannot believe I spent almost $200 on a vacuum for it to only last 4 months.
Poorly  Engineered, DO NOT Buy  I am giving it one star because I have to in order to post this review, however it deserves no stars. Whoever engineered this vacuum needs to go back to school, and the quality assurance team that tested this needs to be fired as they were clearly not sober on the job. Where to begin with the issues the vacuum has...  It's very heavy, and will not track behind you when you pull it. It veers out of control either to the left or right, usually crashing into furniture or a wall. Usually I carry it. The back wheels are considerably larger than the predecessor, and are made of a sticky rubber that attracts and captures the power cord, so you frequently have to untangle the cord from the vacuum or you end up dragging the whole thing, which leaves ugly marks on my hard wood floors. The suction hose seems short and of a hard plastic, so it doesn't move well and tends to tangle up on itself. The tools are all really bulky and cheaply made. The carpet tool is lined with a thick rubber, so it will not vacuum the edges or corners of a room. The hairs are short so if you hve short carpet you will not get great results from it. The crevice tool is short, but thick, and has two large hole on the side that essentially remove any sucking power from it. It's essentially useless. I have covered the holes to add sucking power but it's so short and wide it doesn't reach where I need it to. The brush tool is also useless as the hairs are really short, and unless you are at a certain angle it will not get dust off of anything, but the cheap plastic scratches wood and furniture like a champ (I had to refinish a table because mistakenly used this to dust with when I first got the vacuum). The hard floor tool is also useless, as the hairs are short and the tool is cheap so the hairs just spread out and allow the plastic to scratch hardwood floors. The pet hair attachment is okay, but again the short bristles do not get all of the pet hair, and the plastic scraping against the furniture that leaves marks. The power cord gets stuck to everything, so I constantly have to stop vaccuming to reclaim the cord from the sofa, table leg, etc. I loath this vacuum with a passion. I almost have an anxiety attack having to use it. I wish a slow painful death on the people involved in its design and testing as means of compensation for all the frustrated owners who have been tormented by having to use it. I will never shop at Sears or buy any Sears brand because of the poor quality of this vacuum. The only reason why we still have it is because my old canister vacuum died while I was on vacation, and my husband thought he was doing the right thing by throwing the old one out and purchasing the newer model. If you are considering purchasing this model do yourself a favour and get something else. You literally would have better results with a broom and dust pan, and won't have to worry about damaging your floors, walls, and furniture.
hmmm ... till I replaced my Dyson, I was not happy.  My Dyson died and needed an inexpensive vacuum in a hurry. Hose is NOT long enough, either is the cord or the brush bristles on the dusting tool. Oh and if you feel like burning your toes or fingers this will deliver when you press the cord rewind pedal.  This isn't for heavy vacuuming, because it starts to get really hot after a long use.
Do NOT buy this vacuum!  I couldn't afford a Dyson or an Oreck, so we did our research and found Hoover to be next on the list.  I have a bad back, so we even sprung for the self-propel feature.  I used the vauum ten times and the belt broke along with the motor.  It was still under warranty, so I called Hoover Customer Service.  Their service is terrible!  It took them over a month to respond to my calls, letters, and e-mails.  In the end, they still weren't helpful and we took the vacuum back to the store.  It had decent sucking power and was relatively easy to use.  The weight made it hard to manuever and the fact that it kept tipping over whenever I used the attachments really got on my nerves.  In my opinion, Hoover is no longer a name of quality and I don't recommend them for ANYTHING!
Good for corners & fair price  I like the price, this is just for corners & crevices etc. Don't think you'll be vacuuming carpet with this or large floor areas you won't but price makes it better a compliment  to vacuuming
Basic functionality is good, but with many quality and design problems  We bought this vacuum in October 2012 based on a Consumer Reports review and this was a let down. We threw this in the trash at the beginning of Feb 2016 and bought another brand. 2.5 years is the shortest I have ever owned a vacuum.  1) The vacuum does a suitable job of vacuuming which is why it gets overall good reviews. Unfortunately, the rest of the functionality has problems. 2) The hose is way too short. It doesn't extend past the handle. When using the hose, clear the area of breakables as it stretches just enough to build up force for when the vacuum inevitably falls over. 3) The handle top with the off/on switch and self-propel switch is detached when unpacking. The self-propel uses a slide mechanism attached to a cable which goes to the bottom of the vacuum. The external on/ off switch is a junk slider switch which strikes an internal on/off rocker switch. Because the handle attaches in such a flimsy way, both of these 2 mechanisms are flaky and become more so over time. When vacuuming, the handle shifts and contributes to a very cheap feel. In fact both switches were so unreliable at the end, they were major factor in throwing it out. 4) Related to the on/off, why use a cheap switch to activate another? They could have put the real, solid switch anywhere on the outside and saved money and eliminated another point of failure. 5) Self-propelling only works sporadically. The normal push-pull motions on the handle are supposed to activate/deactivate it or something when on, but this mechanism was unreliable at best. My wife had to push the unit's full weight most of the time. 6) What is the point of a "wind-driven" curtain attachment? Not being powered, any pressure at all stops the brush spinning. 7) Changing the paper bag and filters is the same process as most other bagged vacuums - no harder or easier 8) Carpet height adjust switches on the bottom head had no problems 9) The attachment attachment points were cheap. Something has to fall off at least once while vacuuming. 10) People say it's loud but it isn't any better or worse than most others.
One Star is One Star Too Many  Here is a letter I wrote to Bosch about this vacuum cleaner ... it doesn't mention all the things that went wrong with it, just a few ...  Dear Bosch:  I own a Formula Electro Duo 1400W vacuum cleaner (blue) which I've used for the past 3 years. The model is BSG71360UC/07.  For the most part, at first I really like this machine. Good suction and quiet. And I even recommended it to two friends who each purchased one.  However ...  Within the the first two months the wand broke and I needed to replace it (the plastic part which is used to adjust the wand height broke causing the wand to move up and down by itself making vacuuming impossible.)  Within two years the power head stopped functioning. I am a tech guy so I opened it up and found that a capacitor on the circuit board that controls the power nozzle was loose.  That is to say, the amount of solder used for the components was insufficient and one of the electronic components (a capacitor) broke loose and failed to make a good connection. Re-soldering it fixed the problem.  About one year later the power brush once again stopped spinning.  This time it was not a poorly fabricated solder joint which caused the failure...  I found that there was no power being supplied by the switch to the power nozzle. Therefore, I had to take apart the nozzle to see what was the matter ... and I found the wires which supply power had been worn right through.  Yes, the wires that supply the power -- the wires which are enclosed in the casing of the power brush, had been worn to the point where they broke ... and why?  Because these wires run between the plastic parts that move back and forth whenever you swivel the power nozzle.  So the normal action of using the machine, the normal action of swiveling the power head in the normal everyday operation of this appliance, caused the electric wires to become worn away, to the point of being a dangerous fire hazard and also to the point of rendering a failed appliance.  This is a blatantly obvious design flaw ... so blatantly obvious that I can not help but conclude it is an INTENTIONALLY designed flaw to severely curtail the life of the appliance. And it is also very dangerous.  To further substantiate my claim that this is a purposeful way to force product failure and therefore product re-purchase, I have found that the power nozzle for this unit has been DISCONTINUED by Bosch and is NO LONGER AVAILABLE anywhere.  So now I have a $500 machine that must be thrown away after 3 years of light use.  I have always considered Bosch products to be of relatively high quality and believed it was smart to pay more for products from your company. Like I said, I have even had friends purchase this appliance (before I began to have these problems.)  I am writing this today in order to receive some compensation, at the very least a new power nozzle for this machine (even though I am sure it will only last a short time due to the design flaws described above.)  Sincerely ....  Okay, that was the letter to Bosch.  What I didn't add was that I also had to replace the plug which only lasted 2 years before it fell apart. I also didn't mention that one of the wheels broke. I also didn't mention that I had to use duct tape around the casing for wires that run along the outside of the wand as it kept falling off.  And I also didn't mention that I had to add duct tape to the end of the wand that inserts into the power nozzle in order to keep it from constantly slipping out (frustrating when your power nozzle goes flying across the room every time you move the wand ...)  To conclude and summarize, I was able to keep this thing running for about three years using new parts, solder, duct tape and fortitude, but eventually the flaws, cheap parts and terrible workmanship gained the upper hand and I had to buy a new vacuum cleaner... and you guessed right, it was NOT a Bosch!
Complex  I returned it because a key part was missing....but it seemed quite complicated for what is was. I re-bought another Shark Steam Mop.
Horrible vacuum-don't buy  We bought this vacuum thinking we were getting a good deal at around $75. You get what you pay for, but in this case, even less. The suction power= poor. It pushes like an oxwagon, catching and requiring UFC strength to move it around the room. The vacuum hose falls out of it's holder while vacuuming several times, slapping your arm as you go, and sometimes even the bottom of the hose comes out while vacuuming. The dust/dirt doesn't always go in the cup it's supposed to, instead it travels to the top or bottom filter, clogging them full after only a few uses. It's cheap and ends up pissing me off more than anything. Vacuuming isn't enjoyable to begin with, but with this useless machine, you'll really hate it.
DO NOT BUY  DO NOT BUY THIS POS! This is my second Dirt Devil and it is worse than the first one. These low end vacuums from Dirt Devil have a little piece int he front that you will lose the first couple od weeks you have the vacuum. Then all this thing does is spread dirt around your house!!!!!!! Dirt Devil says do not return to the retailer. Maybe because they know how bad this product is. Instead you are asked to call their help line which can ring incessantly with no answer or you get put on terminal hold. Then I was told to make a 80 mile round trip to get the thing service ed.  I am throwing this piece of junk in the trassh and never buying Dirt Devil again. Save your money,
The nozzle breaks and it becomes useless
Not built like their older models in design and quality  We have been using Kenmore/Panasonic canister vacuums for 50 years. I have gone through 5 in 20 years and 2 of those have been in the last 4 years. The Kenmore my grandma purchased in 1970 still works and its only problem is the cord won't suck into the canister anymore. All of my vacuums have broken where there are plastic parts.   Surprise, Duh- (grandmas are all metal).  This white model imparticular not only broke off where the hose plugs into the atachment, but theyve redesigned the brush head, its too wide to do the job like the older brushes. In the effort to consolidate the consol, the atachment that gets down in corners, cracks and in between car seats is shorter on this model which is not a benefit because it doesnt reach. The ability to pop the wand out of the carpet atachment to vacuum corners is gone as well. Because they changed to a wide plastic mouth, the wand is no longer a smaller, metal pipe, and you cant get close enough to create the suction needed. Overall- they are made to last about 1 year.  Too bad weve outsourced to the point of cheap products, poor workmanship and such waste. Im going to have to buy another brand, which is a bummer when I know these have been made so great in the past. 
and then the motor completely died because this machine utter piece of crap. Nice design  After vacuuming our 650 sf apartment once per week over mostly hardwood floors and our 8x6 shag carpet for 16 months, a component broke 4 months in, had to be fixed, and then the motor completely died because this machine utter piece of crap. Nice design, terrible construction. DO NOT BUY.
Ugh...  Terrible vacuum!  Won't suck up light ash around my fireplace or much else, not to mention any pine needles from our Christmas tree!  Don't waste your money.  I bought a Dirt Devil vacuum for less than 1/2 the price, and it's a world better than this one.
Nope  I brought this vacuum home from Target and immediately started cleaning.  I have a small house (896 sq. ft.) with all wood floors and a few area rugs.  By the time I got into my final room to clean the vacuum started making a loud sound.  I turned it off and waited a few minutes, tried it again and the sound was significantly worse.  It no longer had any suction and was unbearably loud.  I packed it up and returned it to the store.
This is a terrible floor cleaner  This is a terrible floor cleaner!!! It is awkward and does not dry the floor at all!!! I thought Hoover made better products, but this left dirty streaks on the floor and definitely does not dry at all. I can not return it, because Amazon gives only 30 days to return the product. What a waste of $130.00. Don't buy. You will be very disappointed.
very cheaply made
Hoover Whisper Cyclonic vacuum cleaner  Very hard to push, in fact so hard that I have broken two of the flimsy handles. Do not purchase this junk.
I have owned many less expensive vacuums over the years and this is by far the biggest waste of money/piece of junk I've ever pu  I have owned this vacuum for less than a month, the attachments haven't worked since day 1 because there isn't enough suction, and after 2 or 3 uses it started just turning off after about 5 min. of vacuuming. Not sure if it's overheating or what...my house is extremely tiny and I can only vacuum half of it before it turns off and I have to wait a few hours before it will start working again. I have owned many less expensive vacuums over the years and this is by far the biggest waste of money/piece of junk I've ever purchased. I will not waste anymore money on dirt devil products. If I hadn't thrown away the box I would return this useless item pronto. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!!
Doesn't Do What It Say!  Very hard to use in hard floor. While you have impression this vacuum has strong suction, you have to go through multiple times to make sure the floors are clean.
Great...when it works  I do not write negative reviews lightly, but it's been two years since I bought this product and I feel I must communicate my experience to those who are considering purchasing.  I've only used this unit for maybe 4000 sqft of cleaning total, usually every 6 months or so just doing an apartment.  In this time, I've experienced numerous failures due to either plastic breaking, electrical faults, and leaks.  The repair process can take forever and it is FAR from a no-hassle warranty, with Hoover routinely pushing back on failures that happened within normal operation.  The tanks leak when they are carried around off of the unit, including the waste tank which drips dirty water all over your carpet if you are not careful to prevent this.  The latest failure (which prompted me to finally get around to writing this review) is that the entire unit/motor which drives the rollers and pumps has failed, leaving me with a useless vacuum which cannot dispense water/soap nor scrub.  I suspect the repair will take months (as is my past experience) and may even cost me money.  When the unit works, it is great.  The design is very simple to use and convenient.  It has a blue/black light for seeing stains as you move it around, and it pushes hot air underneath the unit to help warm the carpet for more effective cleaning.  It's so unfortunate they had to build this thing out of cheap plastic components which either crack or break under the normal operating conditions.  Bottom line: I really regret buying this.
Hard to use.  Felt like I was knocking a basketball around.  Couldn't get the brush to stay on.  Gave it away and bought a good old hoover.
DO NOT USE WITH SHAG OR FRIEZE  We own 2 Dysons.  Great vacuum if you have short pile carpet and hardwood floors with no area rugs.  Moved into a new home with frieze carpet...ratchet noise of the beater brush getting stuck started immediately.  Called tech support and they said remove two small gaskets underneath, which was easy enough.  However, you need to be a powerlifter or an NFL lineman to push this thing trhough a long pile carpet.  Extremely disappointed in this aspect of the product.
Pure junk  What a piece of junk, nothing like my old Electrolux, leave it in the closet and use my old one that I have had for 15 years
Lacks in Functionality and Sturdiness  I live in a house with a cocker spaniel and an almost 2 year old toddler. I also have long hair. Dander, loose fur and hair, and spilt food is an everyday part of life. I received this vacuum to test and review. I compared it to two other vacuums I own and use regularly (a 3 year old Shark and a brand new Hoover Windtunnel Max Pet). Here are my thoughts:  PROS:  1. Assembly -- Easy to put together 2. Attractive -- Looks nice 3. Motor -- Sounds good. Quieter than my other vacuums  CONS:  1. Maneuverability -- Just OK. The handle on top may move easily in all directions but the two large tilted wheels don't make it any easier to move than any other vacuum I've used 2. Weight -- Heavy. Much heavier than my Shark. A little lighter than my Hoover WindTunnel Max Pet, which is a beast 3. Suction -- Sufficient but not super strong. About as good as my 3 year-old Shark. Half as strong as  my new Hoover WindTunnel Max Pet 4. Ease of Use -- Poor. My two biggest peeves with this vacuum are: (1) When the handle is in the upright position, the wheels lock. To move the vacuum, the handle has to be in the angled position or I have to just pick it up off the floor and carry it. (2) The hose is inside the handle. To access the hose, I have to first completely unravel the cord, flip the latch on top of the handle to open the handle. The hose is inside. Tedious when I just want to do a quick pick up job on a couple of scattered Cheerios my toddler put in the crevice of my sofa or to suck up an ugly spider that wandered into the house. 5. Design -- Awkward. Other than looking nice, it seems like there was no user input whatsoever when they designed this vacuum. The attachments are strangely housed all over the machine wherever they would fit. The latches used to hold on to the attachments make them difficult to remove and to put back on. 6. Quality -- Subpar. Though nothing has broken so far, Samsung uses a lightweight brittle plastic on all their appliances. After a while they just break off. This has happened to me on a Samsung refrigerator I own. And the plastics on this vacuum feel very similar to the stuff they used in my fridge. The latch on the handle where the hose is stored is probably the first thing that will go. It just has that feel.  As usual, Samsung has delivered a sleek and beautiful-to-look-at appliance that fails to impress or deliver on many levels. I'm not a Samsung fan but every once in a while I give it a chance because it seems so popular (even bought a Samsung cellphone that crapped out on me before I thought it should). But every time I take that risk I always learn not to get lured in by the physical beauty and hype. Same goes for this vacuum.
Don't count on the warranty  I remember fondly as a kid having a Hoover vacuum that lasted several years.  I did tons of research on this model and decided to purchase it despite some of the reviews that said the plastic connections broke easily.  I figured, I am a pro at using Crazy Glue, so how bad could it be?  I received this vacuum and it assembled with ease.  It has great suction and picks up a lot of dirt.  However, one of the reasons I purchased this product was the ability to turn off the front brushes to be easier on my hard wood floors.  The second time I pressed the button, it broke and popped off.  I figured no big deal - rather than packaging up the vacuum and bothering Amazon with it (I have only used it for one week, so well within the return policy), I called Hoover customer service to see if they could send me a new button that I could just pop back in.  No luck there - they don't carry the part, so they directed me to one of their authorized service dealers.  So I called the service dealer and they told me they had the button in stock by would charge me $14.99 for the part (which probably costs them less than $1) and $19.99 to install It (which is ridiculous since even my 4 year old can pop it back in without any tools).  When I told them I had just purchased the product and it was under warranty, they told me "Oh, it's a warranty claim.  You will have to bring the product in and we will have to validate the warranty.  It will take 3-4 weeks for us to validate the warranty, fix, and return your product."  What?  You have the part in stock and I can show you the Amazon sales receipt!!!  They are throwing up these hurdles because they are hoping you will either pay the $35 to fix a cheap plastic part or they won't have to honor the warranty.  Hoover - I don't want to do business with a shady company like this. I'm taking advantage of Amazon's easy refund policy to return this product and purchase a different brand.  You ought to be ashamed of yourselves!!!
I gave it some time to see if I liked it. I do NOT  I purchased this Shark Navigator for my second home last Feburary 2017. I gave it some time to see if I liked it. I do NOT. Its bulky, heavy and awkward. When I use it on my 9x12 area rugs i can't even move it to vacuum! Don't know if its too strong suction? I feel like I wasted my money. I have to purchase another vacuum. Have an upright Oreck in my other home and loved it from the beginning! Looks like I'll have to put out some money again to buy what is decent. My recommendation is do not purchase this Shark Navigator!
Next time I'll order from Costco.  Complete waste of money.  This machine stopped working less than two months after I received it therefore less than one month after I could return it.  Next time I order from Costco
Don't buy this product.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  We will never buy a Shark again. This one lasted only months before it died.  When I called customer service, they wanted me to pay an extra $100 for them to send us new parts.  An $100 on top of what we already paid!  The "new" parts came and the vacuum is worse - it died in 2 minutes.  I'm sure we got a lemon, and having them simply send us a new one would allievate the issue.  But given our vacuum we had previously lasted 10 years with zero issues, and this one didn't even last months and customer was not helpful, we won't waste any more time, effort, or $ on this product.
No warranty- broke down after 6 months  Worked ok while it did.. quit working afer about six months. Hoover declined the warranty out of the reason that I used it in a small office. After some arguing and demanding amazin has agreed to refund me about 80%. Of the cost of the vacuum. Would probably go for something else if I were you.
I hate it  I am very disappointed with this vacuum.  I would return it if I could.
Turn back while there's still time.  The first one's motor turned on and off while I was using it for the first time. The replacement came and the hose was crushed. I really needed to clean my house so I decided to keep it. The hose constantly comes out of the floor unit, which is extremely frustrating while I'm vacuuming.
Total Inconvience For A Lot Of Money  We bought one about 2 years ago. We hate it ..hate hate hate.  1-On thick carpet...no ,no no....it will stick and pull. Suction is excellent .........but difficult to movre.   2- Doesn't fit in corners,when you release the akward handle and put on the square adjustable brush/slide for brush or slide for no brush....it doesnt stay wher eyou want it. When you are using the hose with a attachments ...BELIEVE ME....THIS THINGS MOVES ALL OVER THE PLACE.  Empty the bucket ,which doesnt hold much and putting it back ,whew ...you have to get it just right .....  3- We order from dyson a new filter and it was terrible it has a gap in it...and it fills up with dust very fast... we have to vacum and clean it well with a indoor /outdoor vac...then it has to dry really well.  This is very expensive , and heavey...   DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR ,TRY IT IN THE STORE ,AMKE SURE YOU USE THE HOSE END......BEFORE BUYING ...YOU WILL SEE.....
Please be aware  This is a great product,  just hope that it doesn't break,  I have to wait 3 months for parts to arrive.
DO NOT BUY!  I won't waste my time or yours re-writing what a poor product this is. Buy $60 worth of lint rollers and you'll save yourself countless headaches, have better results, and you'll be saving electicity.
Get what you pay for.  The motor to drive the belt to spin the brushes on the bottom stopped working during my first usage. Has great suction strength but is constructed poorly out of flimsy materials.
It is stop working after a month.  DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM.
Piece of Junk  It does an excellent job of cleaning the carpet.  This is the 2nd clean water tank and the 2nd Hoover I have bought due ot sticky springs or hairline cracks.  Call me a glutton for punishment! Just lifting it full, out of the sink and bumping it will cause cracks.  GIMME A BREAK!! The recovery tank has leaks after about thirty days of use.  When the recovery tank breaks on this one.....I will reduce the SteamVac to small indiscernible bits.
Shot sparks out the back  Only used 3 times and it has started shooting sparks out the back of it and of course I bought it over 30 days ago so I can't even get a refund for the piece of garbage.
Floormate  The Floormate did a wonderful job on cleaning the floor but after we filled the tank a few times it started to leak.
Does not live up to expectation  I purchased this from Crate and Barrel three years ago.  For the first year it worked great, but after that, the suction lessened considerably.  I've had two repairs costing around $150, and as of right now, it is clogged again. Not to mention, the exorbitant cost of filters and bags to maintain it.  There is virtually no suction for the attachment tools either.  This is not what I would expect for a high end vacuum cleaner (I paid $600+).  Just to note, I have two cats and two adults living in the home, so this vacuum has been used about twice a week in a pretty tidy environment to begin with.  What a disappointment.  I am done with high end vacuum cleaners. . . luckily, I have my old Hoover (about 10 years old) to fall back on.  Learn from my lesson and save your money!
Have had 1 year and piece broken.  Have had one year and the clip that holds the tube into the vacuum popped off.  Which means I cannot use the vacuum at all. Contacted Hoover as the product has 2 year warranty. But was told the part is no longer available from the factory.  And to try taking to a service center to see if they had they part.  Guess I will have to try that. Seems like Hoover does not stand behind their product and will not be purchasing their products again.
Not just overrated... actually useless.  I just picked this piece of junk up from Target.  I was looking for a bagged canister vacuum, but between Target and Best Buy, no one carries them anymore.  I knew bagless vacuums were a extremely overrated, and basically a giant marketing ploy, but I figured if I went for an extremely high end one, it would do at least as well as a cheap bagged vacuum.  Boy, was I wrong.  This vacuum cleaner is a just pure junk. Here's why:  It can't pick up anything off a hardwood floor. It just pushes things around.  The attachment arm is incredibly poorly designed, so that won't allow you to clean anything at waist height... It might be great for ceilings, but good luck cleaning your furniture.  Lastly, it can't get under furniture.  Not that it matters, because it would suck up anything under there even if it could fit.  I'm returning this useless, overhyped product as soon as possible.
Good cleaner but no way to lift it  We have had this sweeper for about 3.5 months. It does a very good job at cleaning but there is no place to pick it up except for the top of the handle. It is bulky and very difficult to use if you have to lift it up like on a stairs.  To carry it up and down stairs, I lift at the top of the handle and then at the roller bar. Ridiculous engineering.  I would not recommend this product unless you live in a ranch and won't have to lift the product.
Very short chord and seemed like it spit out dirt while vacuuming  Zero stars if I could! Very short chord and seemed like it spit out dirt while vacuuming. When I was almost done vacuuming for the first time it just stopped working.
The DC24 is a much better machine  For 4 years my husband and I lived in an apartment with 85% carpeting. We bought a DC24 All floor when we moved in and used it over that time. What an amazing little machine! It was very light weight yet powerful, and cleaned our carpets beautifully. I used it to vacuum the kitchen too and though the suction isn't as strong on hard surface as it is on carpets, it did a sufficient job.  When the DC40 came out, my husband decided bigger and more powerful is better and that we should switch up. After we got it, I wasn't impressed. It's a lot heavier than the DC24 (and I do all the vacuuming so I really notice the difference) and the DC40 has a high-pitched whine that I didn't care for at all. Also the bristles on the attachment brush are not as firm as on the DC24, making it harder to brush out dirt and dust wedged in crevices. Well, fine. I dealt with it.  We recently moved to a house with 90% hard floors and little carpeting and I am surprised at how poorly the DC40 cleans my floors! The machine has incredibly powerful suction on carpets but on hard floors, not so. In my kitchen I have to go over crumbs 2 or 3 times before they get picked up. And I am talking about loose crumbs, not stuck to the floor. And forget about sucking up a loose cheerio or cornflake off the floor. The floor plate on the machine is so low to the ground, only the tiniest pieces get picked up. This is very frustrating!  And here's the thing that makes me really upset. We have an area rug in the living room. It's just a normal shag rug, no tall loose fibers. The vacuum sucks so hard that I can't push it across the rug. That means I can only pull it; pull a heavy machine that does not want to budge off the spot it's sucking. I called the customer service people at Dyson and the lady on the phone told me that they recommend I take the plate off the bottom and remove the piece of glued rubber from around the outside of the plate, which will allow more air to get in and help the vacuum move. Fine, but the rubber piece is glued in there. I'm supposed to destroy the base plate to do that? It feels wrong for some reason.  I really don't know what to do. I was very happy with my DC24 and happy to recommend it to friends and family, but with this one, I get frustrated just looking at it! The service person recommended I take it in to be serviced to see why it's not sucking up the cheerios and whatnot off my floors, but since my DC40 is only 2 months old I'm convinced it's a design flaw that's responsible and there's nothing having it serviced can do.  Next I'll look into selling this one used and getting something else that can handle hard floors better. As far as I'm concerned, Dyson needs to go back to the drawing board with this one.
worst customer service ever  I purchased the Hercules In Sept 2009 to replace a Dyson.  What a mistake!!!!!  The bags do not fit properly, and at a cost of about $4.00 a pop its tought to ruin 2 or three of them before you find one that semi-works.  I have been trying to contact the Company, but no one answers the phone, nor do they return your calls.  I am now stuck with an over priced piece of junk, and no way of getting any help.  The closest warranty repair is 100 miles away.  BEWARE THIS ITEM IS A RIP-OFF!!!!
Lasted a few weeks  Right off the bat I had to change the drive belt for the brush because the one that was on it was warped and burned in one spot. Within a few more weeks it stopped working again but I could not find a problem so I trashed it. Never buy Hoover again!
Purchased this product in July 2015. The first time it just stopped working and Amazon was kind enough to replace it. It also does not have adequate suction and the attachment tools are clumsy and inefficient.  Well, today it just stopped working again. I am going to try and contact the manufacture is see if they can resolve the issue but this will be the third replacement since I purchase this item.  Stay away from this product, buyer beware.
The suction is horrible with this vacuum  The suction is horrible with this vacuum.  I haven't even had it a year and it has difficulty picking up threads on carpeting.  I end up having to vacuum with the nozzle because the suction is so poor.  It doesn't matter if the receptacle is empty or not.  Would not recommend this product.
Seals to floor then becomes very hard to move  70% of my floors are hard (wood and tile). When the vacuum is set to Hard Floor, the vacuum will  stick to everything 60% of the time. I have to set the height to 4 (1~3 sticks as well) to stop it from sticking. Of course, things like kitty litter dust does not get picked up at this setting. When its set to Hard Floor, it picks up the smallest of dust, but if I have to fight to move it, its useless to me. It seems to create a seal around itself and the floor. My wife and kids cant even move it. Hoover support said to put to higher setting after I already told them at higher settings it will not pick up dust. So, back it goes.
Buy something else  This has to be the most useless vacuum cleaner in existence. Much like the Italian government, it makes a ton of noise, pretends to get things done but when you look back it has achieved absolutely nothing. Routinely covering itself in more dust than actually ends up inside it, this complete and total waste of space deserves to be burnt, then have its remains reconstituted so it can be burnt a second time. Once I get a replacement from a different brand I will take great pleasure in forcibly dismantling this thing with a sledgehammer and then posting the results to Bissell.
Too hard to clean, smelly and attracted bugs  Neat concept but I wish it was easier to clean or had some kind of disposable liners inside. We have a baby and toddler and lots of spilled food and crumbs on the floor. The first couple weeks we were loving this product. But then it started to smell really bad with the food sitting inside. If you only have dry items being swept I would say this is great. But if there is anything that could become sticky or wet or moldy (ie- dropped foods) then stay away from this unless you plan to empty it daily, which kinda defeats the purpose. There's no easy way to wipe or sanitize the inside either. Just get a regular dustpan and broom, it's way less effort.
Waste of money!  Just took my Floor Mate Deluxe out of the box...doesn't work.  Water doesn't go on the floor properly, and no water is being picked up and going into the dirty tank.  I've had Floor Mates for years...I think this is my third one...but I've always had the regular Floor Mate.  Never had a single problem with them.  This time I decided to "upgrade".  Big mistake!!!  I do not recommend this model at all.
First one motor failed in less than a year and month old warranty replacement is leaking.  Only giving two stars since Hoover was good about replacing the first defective unit under warranty. If not for that, it would get zero stars if possible. We bought this on our other Amazon account 13 months ago. Motor went out two months ago but Hoover did replace it under warranty. Unfortunately, a hose has broken somewhere in the new machine and it leaked the water tank all over the floor. Unlike the older design we still have that has given us zero problems, this one is a piece of junk.
Belt keeps breaking  Pros: Strong suction combine with a power brush head, suck and pull everything from the carpet. Like all new vac, it is light weight. Cons: The belt is loose and keeps slipping off and get caught in the drive shaft, which in turn chews up the belt and you'll smell burnt rubber; the power brush head stops working. I thought of fixing this problem because a love the cleaning power, but decided not.
Poor Reliability -- Not User Serviceable  I bought one of these about 5 years ago. It always seemed to work OK, but since I'm a (retired) guy, to be honest, I can't really tell the difference between a good vacuum and a bad one. I have a daughter who sometimes cleans houses professionally, incidentally, and she said she can't really tell either. :-) She does have a Dyson, though (different model), and doesn't like it because of the heavy weight.  I haven't really used the vacuum a lot over the 5 years I've owned it. Typically, I vacuum the 500 sq ft room that I spend most of my time in about once per week and then I have a housekeeper come in about once per month and clean the entire house.  A few weeks ago the beater bar quit turning. So, I promptly turned the vacuum over and began taking it apart. After about 5 minutes if fiddling with it, it became painfully obvious that the belt wasn't user serviceable. At that point I called up a video on the internet for instructions and found that some special tools were required and even though the job didn't appear to be too difficult, it didn't look all that easy either.  So, I took it to a local repairman who replaced the filter ($21.95) and the beater bar ($32.99) and the belt. The charge for labor was $48.95 and the total was $111.57. Then when I got it home, I discovered it was unworkable because the cluth was slipping and making a racheting sound. So I took it back and the cost for replacing the clutch was $95.80, for a grand total of $207.37.  If one were paying $207 for heavy use after 5 years, that might not be so bad. However, I would estimate that my usage at about the equivalent of one or two years for a typical housewife who vacuums regularly and that would be intolerable.
An overpriced, overhyped, underperforming piece of crap  At the urging of a close friend's wife, who has one, I bought a DC25. She raved over how easy it was to use, how it never needed a bag changed, and how well it "sucks up everything but the color out of the carpet!".  I used it for a month, trying to be generous and give it the benefit of the doubt.  After a month of putting it through every pace I can think of, here's my conclusion...  It's junk.  Crappy, expensive junk at that.  1) It doesn't "suck up everything but the color out of the carpet".  In fact, the only thing about it that sucks is how poorly it performs in light of the marketing claims.  Yeah, you can see stuff swirling in the canister.  Big deal.  Problem is there's a whole bunch of that same stuff it left in your carpet.  The hose from the beater head to the dustbin is way too small, the suction motor is puny, and the beater head is, at best, vestigial.  Overall the thing just doesn't work well.  Period.  The 50 yr old Kirby I inherited from my grandmother could suck this thing back through its own hose. (More on that hose later...)  2) "You never need to change a bag!"  Sure, but you have to take a shower every time you empty the dustbin.  Want to know what it's like to empty the thing?  Get a half gallon pitcher, fill it 1/3 full with pastry floud and 10X (very fine) powdered sugar.  Now try to pour it into a trash can or dumpster without the poweder flying everywhere and sticking to everything.  That's what emptying this damnable canister is like.  And that's AFTER you figure out how to get the rickety, frustrating latching mechanism to work.  3) All the attachments are onboard.  Correct, they are.  The procedure for getting the hose uncoupled and attached to the "extension wand" (the handle, which you have to pull out of the machine) is just as complex as switching from the beater head to the hose on the afotermentioned Kirby.  It's no advantage other than having it right there and not having to walk the ten feet to the closet to get the hose.  Big friggin deal.  And the attachments don't work all that well anyway because the vacuum not only has no suction, it also moved no air. (see item #1 above)  Which brings us to...  4) The attachment hose.  Yeah, it's onboard.  Yeah, it's convenient to pull out and hook up.  It's also un-reinforced along its length and is CONSTANTLY trying to collapse back into its unextended state.  In other words, the thing is always fighting you.  If you pull the hose out to its full length and let got it instantly snaps back into the collaped position, and with a fair amount of force, too.  It pulls the vacuum around after you like some way-to-friendly dog that's forever underfoot or right in your face. On a hard floor I can't even get the hose to extend unless I physically restrain the vacuum in some way.  Even then the hose is trying to pull itself back to the vacuum all the time, making using the hose-end attachements that much more frustrating, scooting the vacuum over to you, or tipping it over.  5) The Dyson is light and easily maneuvarable.  Yes, it is, but so is my bedside trash can.  And the trash can holds more and is easier to empty.  6) The heavy duty motor pulls 11 big amps!!  Yeah, and?  I can pull a full 15 amps by shorting the cord.  So?  How much power the motor uses has exactly zilch to do with how the vacuum performs.  I tried.  I really did.  I went through all the motions for a month hoping I was doing something wrong and wanted to justify the price and the hype.  But in the end the Dyson simply didn't live up to the marketing.  It's a product made for being pretty on TV first and performing second (or maybe third, fourth, or fifth, for that matter).  It just doesn't work well at all.  I ended up selling it on Craigslist and getting a reconditioned Kirby G5 for the same money.  Yeah, it's heavier and I have to carry an attachment or two around with me, but it actually WORKS!!  If it lasts as long as the one I got from Gramma (which still works like a champ) then I'm money wayyyyyyyy ahead.
Worst vacuum I have ever owned  Worst vacuum I have ever owned. To begin with the canister did not sit flush with the suction, so while it worked fine, it could have been a lot better. Had this vacuum for less than three months and it's already broken. It was not even used that much since only three rooms in my house have carpet and the rest are hardwood. Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT GET THIS VACUUM.
Thge Best Piece of Floors Equipment I Have Ever Seen  UPDATE: THIS WORKED LIKE 6 TIMES AND NO LONGER WORKS. . This thing is very well and simply designed and performs for me as advertised. My tiles are hard to wash because of the large and sunken grouting, but this machine gets in there, cleans, and sucks up the dirty water. It's also easy to push over wet surfaces, and is easy on the old back. It is easy to switch back and forth between modes with a simple swith. The on-off switch is covered in rubber. It comes with brushes for wood and tiled floors. I recommend this without reservation.
Don't waste your money  I tried this vacuum in the store and was impressed with the extra large back wheels that made it push smoothly.  I got it home and the vacuum overheated constantly.  It takes at least a half hour for the thing to cool down so you can use it again.  I thought that I might have just have a lemon so I exchanged it for a new one.  Same thing.  It clogs very easily and requires four screws to be removed to take the top cover off to get to the belt or anything that might need unclogging inside.  Then it is a challenge to get the cover back on.  The only thing I like besides the easy maneuvering is the reuseable bag.
Horrible  I ordered this because it got great reviews.  It has not worked well since I got it.  Various parts keep getting clogged and we are constantly emptying the hose trying to get it to work.  It doesn't pick up anything or, if it does, it gets clogged.  We have spent a lot of time trying to make this work.  After finally giving up, I tried to return it but the window had expired after one month.  Do not buy this!
Do not recommend buying.  Left streaks of dirt all over rug. My rug looked better before I used the bissell on it. Had trouble rolling on the rug. On hard wood my floors looked better when I sweeped and mopped it myself.
I bought the first one in 2015 and it worked great for about a year and half then the brush underneath was stuck.  I bought a second one in 2017 and it wouldn't charge fully after three months of use.  So I used the old battery charger for the second vacuum.  Now it is 2018, the second one has the same problem with the brush.  It appears that this vacuum cleaner works great but you will need to buy one every year or so.
If I could give it zero stars I would. This vacuum only picks up dust. I have one short haired dog and a toddler and this vacuum picked up nothing. I had to unclog it every 5 mins and the canister only collected dust. Very frustrating. Save your time and money and don't buy this vacuum.
Did not live up to the Hoover name  I bought this Hoover FloorMate SpinScrub Wet/Dry Vacuum to use on our hardwood floors. The cleaning mixture did not come out evenly, it came out unevenly. It did not clean the floors in a uniform manner since the solution only came out in "spits & sputters". I made adjustments, and tried to see if there was anything I was doing wrong. Nothing seemed to help so I boxed it up and sent it back. When I went to box it up, I even had problems with that....When I first got the vacuum I mistakenly carried it by the handle and of course the handle fell off TEWICE. Then when I went to re-box the item, the handle needed to be taken off for it to fit in the original box for shipping...well you guessed it, the handle stayed firmly in place. It would NOT come off ! It took my husband & I TWO HOURS unscrewing several parts to get the handle off and re-screwing everything back together so it would fit in the box properly. NOT A GOOD TIME!!!
one Star  Floor tool broke after one year and cannot find a replacement.
Dirt Blows Out  I was really excited to have a vacuum to use for our one carpeted area downstairs. Unfortunately it looks like I'll still be hauling our heavy duty upstairs vacuum down every week. The first time we used this Hoover it picked up a lot of dirt, but it also blew a lot of dirt out as well. The lower half of the whole vacuum was covered! This will be going back for sure.
New Hoover Flooremate  This is an OK hard floor cleaner, but not as good as the previous model (3040).  This one is much smaller than the previous 15 inch model, and takes almost twice the strokes of that model to clean the floor.  Additionally, who at Hoover decided to put a 20 foot cord on this model?  They need to have this cord wrapped around them.  This cord needs to be at least 25 feet and preferably 30 feet.  Look for another unit; this one is not worthy of the Hoover name.
The suction is okay but all parts fall off as you are trying to vacuum. The hose comes out of the base, the sections come apart. very irritating.
HORRIBLE DUST or DIRTBAG SMELL WHEN VACUUMING  This is a great vacuum for picking up dog hair etc - great suction. But it is very heavy to carry from floor to floor and even though it can vacuum well - it gives off a horrible DUST or DIRTBAG SMELL to the entire room. From the moment I got the vacuum (NEW) I thought how in the world could this be right...I ordered new hepa filters and changed the vacuum bag - with NO LUCK. I called and emailed Miele several times asking for an answer - the smell in the air was DIRT/DUST and it was awful and yet no one at Miele had any idea what was wrong except to tell me to get new filters - which I have done faithfully yearly - with NO IMPACT ON THE STINK. This is very bad for anyones lungs or for those with asthma or breathing difficulties - not to mention that the room smells terrible after vacuuming - not the feeling you want after cleaning a room. If anyone has a fix for this - please let me know and I would give it a much higher rating!
expensive and heavy; broke dead after 23 months  Suction was very good, but vacuum was heavy.  then smoked up and died just short of 2 years.  Previous simpler and lighter vacuums have worked just as well and lasted much longer.
Good for a while  Right out of the box I loved this vacuum.  Easy to operate, great suction, flexible with bagless or bagged options.  Then it began to lose power, got harder to push, the "lifetime" belt began to stretch and fail, and finally the switch failed.  Now that Hoover was purchased by a chinese company, getting the part is rediculous (over $40 for the switch plus shipping and labor).  Typical of these products, they work well for a while, but long term they can't because they are cheaply made.  I recommend Riccar (still made in the US) or the Eureka sanitaire models - almost indestructible with steel and aluminum construction (not plastic) and they stand behind their products with 5 year warranties!  This vacuum never made 5 years and, sadly, is another addition to our growing land fill.
Doesn't live up to hype  I love the idea of the Animal, having a large cat and 2 very fluffy Samoyeds.  This sounded like the answer to my vacuuming prayers. Worth the money if it would make keeping the fluff factor in our house to a minimum. In its favor,it's fairly easy to cart around and it does a great job of picking up dirt and fir. After a few months of use on both carpeting and hardwood floors, I noticed that it no longer glides on the bare floors, but drags, and leaves marks on the floor. Seems the little wheels have broken off. Also annoying is the fact that I need to stop 2 or 3 times each time I vacuum in order to clean out the fur that has wrapped itself around the rotor. I thought this was designed for pet owners! If they can make a Samoyed-proof product, I'll buy it. This vacuum was not worth the money for me.
Not best for hardwood floors IMO  Reviews all said best for hardwood floors,  but we found that not to be the case. Without the lift away brush on, it didn't pick up all and with it on, the brush kicked it all out the back. Thw hand tools had wonderful suction and worked great.  Easy to disassemble and reconnect.  Returning item due to 100% hardwoods throughout home.
I should've listened...to the bad reviews.  Just as they said, the self-propel went out after only 3 uses.  Shame on me! This is the second Hoover I've regretted buying.  Never again!
Short lifespan  Not bad for the money, I guess.  But mine died within less than 2 years despite minimal use (tiny apartment so not much to sweep)..  Also, the dust tank doesn't work well for pet hair.  Fuzz accumulates in the top where hand can't reach, and won't fall or easily shake out.  Kept having to use scissors or the like to pull things out.
This vacuum is not for carpets at all!  I bought this vacuum based on theses reviews, I was/am disappointed. I needed it for vacuuming all floor types, I promise you it only vacuums hard floors. It picks up dog hair but only 6x3 inches of it, the canister is tiny, you empty it constantly. I also thought it would help my bad back it is not very big and I bought the strap to carry it around easier. Now your lugging around a small vacuum with a long orange extension cord (no kidding!). I rarely use it because I have rugs on top of hardwood floors and it does not do carpet at all. I had to buy a good Panasonic vacuum to vacuum the dog hair I purchased this one to do. I don't know why they show it next to an upright. Hoover must have pulled something (this is probably not what you are looking for.) The bags are special order because they are so small and you will need a lot of them.
Was a god deal once  Was good for a year and a half. Then the suction stopped. The only real cons were the weight and filters were a bit difficult.to clean. I would buy this again but the Shark looks like a good deal. I checked the filters and hose. No go. And the roller brush.
Started out great but won't pick up crumbs off bare floor now  This started out working awesome.  It would practically suction itself to the laminate floor.  Now after a while it sucks at picking up crumbs on our kitchen and wood floors.  I have cleaned filters and cleaned it out many times and can't seem to get it to work better.  There was a little rubber gasket that wore out in no time and I think this is part of the problem why it does not work well on bare floors anymore.  It still seems to work okay on carpet with the rush on but we have lots of bare floor as well as and lots of crumbs from kids.  I recommend just spending more money on a better vacuum.  Out Shark still works good once I figured out where it was clogged (thought it was broken and bought this).  I would buy a shark again over this one.
Dirt devils aren't the best they don't last
So disappointed in this vacuum  So disappointed in this vacuum. It is plugged and I can't figure out where. The dirt will not go into the canister. I've unplugged the bottom, the hose everywhere on this darn thing. I plug it in to vacuum and still dirt won't enter the canister. Now I have to buy another vacuum.
The biggest joke of a vacuum ever..buyer beware  Possibly the worst vacuum ever purchased. I bought this for my small office with lower pile carpet. It was a joke. It felt cheap and when we turned on and tried to use this on our carpet we had a hard time trying to maneuver it anywhere..it kept on getting stuck would not glide at all. You have to be like 4 ft tall to use it so your back doesn't hurt as the wand is small. Anyway, It went back in the box 5 min later. I can't even believe there was a positive comments on this.  The inly thing positive about this is It looked cute bright red and small and light in size. Maybe if u just used it for hardwood possibly. I guess you get what you pay for. I had to chalk it up and spend an extra 100 to get a normal vacuum.
Very unhappy  I had bought two of these vacuums, one from Amazon and one from a different store and I am returning both.  These vacuums are supposed to work well with pet hair, and I have to say after heavy use they both stopped working.  These vacuums are not made for heavy dog hair. Very disappointed.
The wheels are for looks only  The wheels are for looks only, they don't turn easily enough nor do they extend much beyond the vacuum cleaner so you have to drag this turkey and i'm disabled with a bad back and this cleaner kills me. They need to put wheels that extend beyond the vacuum cleaner and that turn and swivel. freely, and preferably 4 wheels not three. Suction is good and the cord reel's in smoothly and the height adjuster setting is clearly visible.
Broke with in two weeks  Seem like a great machine until two weeks of using it on light carpet.  Then the front spinning rolled stopped spinning. This vacum is a piece of garbage.  Don't waste your money on it.
Heavy and a Hassle!  Ok, yesterday I went through the usual door-to-door salesman hassle already described by others.  Yes, the price is negotiable.  You should be able to get the same price as the best new price shown here on Amazon...the salesman will start at 2400 dollars, which is intimidating, then tell you about all the "discounts" he is so generously giving you, then a couple hundred off with a trade-in...that got us to 1700 dollars...that's when the real negotiation starts...and you have to be willing to walk away to get the best price.  Then today I went to work vacuuming my house...wow, am I going to be sore tomorrow!!!  And yes, I put it on D for Drive.  Here are the pros and cons as I see them after nearly 3 hours of vacuuming.  Pros: - Picks up an AMAZING amount of dirt from what appears on the surface to be a clean carpet or floor.  The new bag has a lot of dirt in it after just one session. - Heavy duty construction, lots of metal where all other vacuums are plastic - Nice light on the front  Cons: -Very difficult to maneuver around furniture! -Does not transition simply from carpet to hardwood or other hard surface...you have to turn it off, kneel down, lift the cover, turn a metal dial to the other setting to turn rotating brush either on or off...restart.  Sounds simple enough, but if you have mixed floors and multiple area rugs, this gets old fast. -Wheels left marks all over my hardwood as I moved the vacuum back and forth...so I abandoned trying to clean the hardwood in the upright configuration. -Changing from upright to portable canister mode is a HASSLE! -"Portable canister mode" with the handle is very heavy! Tried to use it on the carpeted stairs...won't reach all the  areas, can't get front edge or corners or the vertical portion of the steps this way.  Abandoned this effort in disgust and I don't plan on using the Kirby this way ever again. -Power Cord keeps coming undone from routing notches on upright handle...annoying -Stick used with different attachments is in two pieces that just slide together...feels cheap and feels like it will probably start coming apart after extended use -Transition to use of attachments is again, a huge hassle.  NO onboard attachments...you have to go back to the huge caddy to retrieve those as needed. -Hardwood floor attachment...did a nice job...but I'll stick with my SEBO X4 rather than go to the hassle of switching to the attachment mode -As part of the demo yesterday, the salesman used the Kirby in foam cleaning mode in my living room...NOT impressed.  The very small cleaning solution holding tank, and the small tray that holds the dirty solution, would result in so many iterations of cleaning and dumping, that I would never use the Kirby for this except in an emergency spill situation.  The carpet was very stiff where the salesman shampooed it yesterday, and all the stains were still there.  So with a stiff neck and sore shoulders and arms, I'm writing this review and still contemplating on wether I should return it.  The ONLY redeeming feature for me with this monstrosity is the amazing suction power and amount of dirt it pulls out.  I hate this thing for opposite all the reasons I love my Sebo X4.  My Sebo is light, moves effortlessly from carpet to hardwood to tile to linoleum to area rug, highly maneuverable, on board attachments, and quick transition to attachments (don't even have to turn it off).  But alas, the salesman proved to me yesterday that my Sebo does not suck the down deep dirt out.  And the carpeted areas of the house, especially the kids play areas, look fabulous after the effort.  Is the dirt factor worth over 1200 bucks in the long-run...I'm not sure.
Not Your Mother's Electrolux, Sadly.  As has been pointed out by others - - but I'll say it again - - this isn't really an Electrolux vacuum cleaner. It is a Eureka low- to mid-range vacuum with many design flaws. It is hard to understand how Electrolux would allow its once-excellent name to be associated with this embarrassing product line.  Let me say that after five years of keeping the Electrolux parts dealers in business, I've had enough and gone with a Kenmore unit that cost half what the Oxygen did, but is clearly superior in construction and design. For one thing, the Kenmore has a METAL pipe between the handle and power head - - not plastic.  The recurring problems I had with the Oxygen had mostly to do with the very flimsy electrical path between the handle and the power head. The connectors seem to wear rapidly, soon shorting and producing heat - - probably from dangerous electrical arcing. I've had to replace the plastic handle pipe more than once because shorting melted it! Also, the piece connecting the power head to the handle column is made of plastic, so that, one day, it cracked and the entire handle assembly broke free. Note that this vacuum cleaner saw only routine, typical household use. It was not treated roughly.  Had Electrolux (or Eureka) built a sturdy handle and electrical system for this unit, choosing metal over plastic, the Oxygen could have been a much better product. The cannister and motor seem to be of good quality. The electrical problems between the handle and power head are reason to stay away.  Also, be aware that the bag is about the size of a grapefruit.  I highly recommend that you look at the Kenmore 29319 (Orange) vacuum. It's nothing like the Electrolux bruisers from 30-40 years ago, but for the money, it is superior to the Oxygen.
Always gets clogged with pet fur. EVERY Time.  If you don't have any pets, this vacuum may work better for you.  But I have had a terrible time with it, especially cleaning out the dirt cup. EVERY TIME I use this thing, vacuumed up cat hair clogs up in the space just above the cup (all around the teal plastic part in the "cleanview helix" area), which prevents the fur(and a good chunk of whatever else you just sucked up)from falling down into the cup. So whenever I take out the cup to clean it, a bunch of dust/cat litter/dirt/other nasty stuff falls all over the place. To make matters worse, some of the fur/carpet fluff doesn't fall down on its own, so I have to put my hand up inside and pull it all out manually, which results in a disgusting mess every time I use it. I tried cleaning it out between different rooms, thinking maybe I was letting the cup get too full, but nope, the hair still gets stuck. POOR design for pet owners. I'm going to look for a vacuum with bags to replace this thing (WHY are vacuums with bags so hard to find these days?!), because if this is any indication of how the ones with so-called "easy to clean" dirt cups work, I'm out.  Addendum:  The "filter" at the bottom section is also a huge mess to clean.  The inner core of the filter is a plastic cylinder that has a bunch of grooves inside that collect dust and are hard to wash out. I imagine this part will eventually need replacing. The outer layer is a sponge that collects dust (boy does it EVER!), and needs to be washed out regularly or the vacuum starts to lose suction.  Yay, more getting your hands dirty with all the crud the vacuum got out of the carpet!(?) Once clean, both parts have to dry completely before you put them back together, so you can't use it for about a day, even to vacuum up the dust that inevitably falls back out of the vacuum when you open it up to clean it.  TL;DR: This vacuum sucks for pet owners because fur clogs it up. The filter is also a mess to clean.
I have 3 cats and at first I loved this vacuum  Bought this in May of 2017. I have 3 cats and at first I loved this vacuum.  The turbo attachment was my new best friend! It is now December.....a piece cracked off inside the turbo attachment so it will hardly twirl around anymore. The hose doesn't stay in the hole, the cat hair gets in EVERY little crevice, so you have to take it apart and clean it every time you use it. I now say, it's the worst vacuum I've ever owned.
Not what we had hoped for  With various Panasonic and Amazon rebates, we were able to get this vacuum for a great price.  It seemed to work well at first, picking up a lot of dirt and hair (the dog & cat shed like crazy) from the carpets.  The first issue we noted was that it was difficult to empty the canister, as the dirt & hair would wedge itself between the filter & the cansiter.  It was a pain to get out, dust would get everywhere.  Then the vacuum started throwing the belt, eventually it would come off every couple minutes.  We had purchased a couple replacement belts, but they did the same thing as well.  So, we made the decision to return it.  Kudos to Amazon for making the return experience a pleasant one.  Ended up buying a cheap Eureka 5550A model, which has worked much better for us.
I just don't like it  I don't like it.  The self-propelled is too aggressive.  It doesn't handle hard floors very well -- you need to get the tools out to do the the corners, and the hose isn't long enough.  You need to wind the cord (it doesn't retract) and it always seems like an ordeal to wind it all up.  We've had it for about a year and it still works fine, I've just never gotten used to it, and I liked my old Hoover canister much better.
Not impressed  I bought this thinking it would be a cheaper version of a Dyson.  Guess I have to take the plunge and buy the real thing!  After attaching the hose clip and inserting the telescopic handle, I did a quick pass on my living room carpet with my 10-year-old Hoover that I bought for $60 new.  I didn't even change the almost full filter bag first.  Then I vacuumed with the Infinity.  It did get some more carpet fiber and pet hair out of the carpet, but not a significant amount.  From what I have read about the Dyson, people are truly impressed and couldn't believe their carpets were that dirty.  This was definitely not the case with the Infinity.  With 3 kids under six, and 4 cats, I really think it should have found a lot more dirt than it did.
Not worth the cha-ching  Loved it for first dozen or so times because it's lightweight and smaller than many uprights so easier to store. Bit of a pain to dump the bagless chamber. Fairly good suction. NOT worth $100 by any means, however, as it began clogging in no time and was impossible to clear out the hose. So frustrating. AND the stupid push-button cord wind thing that I thought would be a lifesaver only worked for a few months before becoming so sluggish it was more time-consuming than winding the cord by hand. I thought Bissell was a good brand and that spending $100 was a good choice/investment but I thought wrong. NEVER buying Bissell again.
Arrived damaged  Parts are of cheap quality and was poorly designed overall. Buy a Shark or a Dyson. You buy cheap you buy twice... if you're lucky.
Defective Product with no customer service  I just purchased this on September 2016 and the hose handle broke.  The hose itself broke and now vacuum doesn't suck anything up. Reached out to Amazon and Shark. No response. Poor customer service. DO NOT BUY.
Wanted to Love It, But Couldn't....Broke within minutes  Oh, I wanted to love this vacuum.  I paid extra for overnight shipping and paced around until it arrived.  From the beginning, this was looking like a good purchase.  Even though it's a refurbished unit, it came in excellent packaging and looked brand new.  It's easy to put together and the manual wasn't that bad, like others had said.  I started it up and it is nice and quiet (relative to other vacuums I've used).  My toddlers didn't even mind being in the same room with it.  I vacuumed one room and was impressed with the results.  I wouldn't say that it was incredible by any means, but it did seem to pick up lots of small particulates and dust that I'd rather not have in my carpet.  I went to another room to vacuum and when I pressed the power button, it wouldn't "click" and stay on.  It got power, but I would have had to stand there and hold the button to keep it running.  I messed with it for  while and went to bed.  Today I researched this issue on line and learned that SEVERAL other people have had the same issue.  I followed a fix-it website's instructions and took the facing off the power button/hose shaft and messed with the actual power switch.  That didn't help.  I finally saw that there was a bent piece of plastic that was keeping the power button from staying engaged.  The only way to fix it was to keep the plastic facing off of the vacuum.  This looked bad, but I was willing to deal with it just to "limp it through" the day until I could get it fixed.  At this point, I figured I'd have to exchange for another unit becasue I got a bad part...no big deal.  I continued to vacuum with the plastic facing removed and not 3 minutes later a VERY loud and annoying noise came from the beater bar area.  The manual suggested that there was something stuck (string/yarn likely) in the beater bar and it needed to be cut out.  I flipped the unit over, removed the bar, and there was absolutely NOTHING in the bar.  Clean as a whistle.  I put the bar back in and continued without the noise.  Another 3 minutes later the noise was back....still nothing stuck in the beater bar.  It continued like this for the rest of my vacuuming exerience. I ended up Googling the beater bar issue and it sounds VERY common among Dysons.  This pretty much told me that I don't want a Dyson afterall.  I was going to live with the power switch not working (exchange for another) b/c I figured it was specific to this unit.  However, the beater bar thing was so frustrating and annoying that I didn't think exchanging for another unit would help.  Looks like a many, many Dysons have this issue.  I sent it back and ordered an LG Kompressor....hope it's better!  I think Dysons may be a little overpriced for the quality.  I also agree with other reviewers that the tools seem chincy and weak.  Also, I didn't love it's performance cleaning my carpeted stair.  The wand was too long and rigid.
allergen be gone  I own a 3 year old version of this vac, what I received was a much used version that looked 3 years older then my vac, everything was scratched, chrome lettering was scratched off and it really looked used, not re-manufactured. While it may work and perform, very disappointed with Allergen Be Gone, won't order any else from them.
Portable, but marred by obvious design flaws.  I've had this vacuum for over a year. For $99.99 (or less), it's inevitably a "you get what you paid for" type of purchase for a vacuumand its STILL disappointing, if not because there are a few areas where it shines. Disappointing, and also astounding how bizarre cost-saving measures held back what could have been an excellent product.  I strongly recommend against purchasing it for the following reasons:   The Floor Attachment: how did they screw up such a key component? Similar to other vacuum plastic hose attachments, the floor attachment connects to the hose with a plastic connector. Unlike other vacuum attachments (including the attachments INCLUDED WITH THE PRODUCT!), the floor attachment was not designed to securely connect with the metal hose. The result? The floor attachment will repeatedly detach from the hose while vacuuming any surface. We had to duct tape the attachment to the hose, which defeats the purpose of buying the vacuum for the convenience and versatility of using other attachments with the long hose!   Two Suction Controls: One suction control knob can be found on the vacuum unit itself. It works great. Why add a second control on the plastic hose handle that doesnt even control the RPM of the unit? Even worse, its shear existence forces the hose to lose suction due to its leaky design. The two cents of plastic used for this moving piece would have been better spent towards securing the connection between the floor attachment and the hose!   Combined Brush, Crevice, and Upholstery Attachment: instead of including three separate attachments that excel at their respective functions, Dirt Devil gives you one transformable attachment that fails to effectively perform ANY function. One side of the attachment includes the brush and a crevice tool that slides out from within the brush. Both tools are at odds with each other: the brush can block the crevice tool from getting into tight spots, and the crevice tool sucks in the bristles of the brush, which in turn acts like a dam for dirt, dust, and hair. The upholstery tool on the opposite side fairs better than the crevice and brush, but it can be frustrating (and kinda gross) to connect the brush end of the attachment to the hose when all of its bristles have been sucked in by the crevice tool!  Its a shame, because aside from these three flaws, it could have been a decent unit. The suction is fairly powerful for the vacuums size, and it maintains a usable amount of suction even when the canister is nearly full. Its not great for carpet, but it works well on hard floors, its lightweight, and I greatly appreciate the washable, multi-stage HEPA filtration system. Its almost as if Dirt Devil took a great product and intentionally crippled its design to justify its low price.
Ours is smoking as I type  We were very happy with it the first few months.  We switched back to bagged because we were sick of all of the dirt the bagless we had was spewing with every empty of the canister.  It had great suction and got the job done even though it was WAY bare bones.  The cord is in an awkward spot too so you almost always run over it.  We've owned this vaccuum for 6 months.  The last time we used it, something didn't sound right and it started to smell.  So the hubby took the plate off the bottom and cleaned it (most other models you can pop the brush out to clean it so this is just one more strike against it).  We turned it on this time, vaccuumed about 2 minutes, if that, and it smelled horrific and when we unplugged it we discovered the bottom was smoking and melted.  NOT recommended.  If you buy this just remember, you get what you pay for.
So I returned it to Amazon which was great and they shipped out a new one  I bought one and it worked very well for about two week. Tried calling the customer service number at Hoover and waited forever and still couldn't get through. So I returned it to Amazon which was great and they shipped out a new one. This one worked great for about 6 weeks and just died. I have a fairly large house with a lot of carpet but this should last years and not weeks.
Not good.  Does not have the power and capacity I need. Tools barely have any suction.
Not for Cleaning!  I have owned my Samsung MotionSync Bagless Upright Vacuum with Detachable Handheld Vac and Built-In Accessories - Refined Wine for less than a month. Right away I noticed how heavy this item was making it dangerous to carry up and down the stairs. I do like the fact that it is an upright. Currently, I use a canister style vacuum which is an absolute pain to since you have to drag both the separate motorized brush, the long hose, and the canister. This vacuum was refreshing that it had the swivel technology allowing it to move easily from area to area in any direction.  It has big plastic wheels that provide a way for the vacuum to move more smoothly. However, I am finding the wheels don't always move so smoothly and I fear that they will break soon.  One of the biggest disappointments is that while the vacuum has good suction, it gets blocked easily by hair. It can suck up wrappers, large crumbs, Legos (I know that is a bad thing to do!), but hair which is all over the place from the long haired shedding cat and the long haired shedding people, it refuses to pick up. Everytime the motorized brush gets obstructed, you have to take out the hair or whatever is in the motorized brush and hit the reset button. This is a safety feature to protect the longevity of your motorized brush. This is not only a disgusting task but as an allergy sufferer this part was triggering my allergies.  After several times of this and having to hit the reset button located on the head of the motorized brush part rather than the upper part of the vacuum; I was fed up. My back was hurting, the chore was taking longer than usual, and my allergies were triggered, the one room was still not done completely.  As part of the swivel technology which uses a huge ball for the vacuum to move around in tight corners, it creates a whole new issue. It is too big to use under a bed or a couch. This means you either have to let the dust accumulate for years and pretend it will magically go away or you have to use the hand held vac which does not have the same suction power. It also does not do such a thorough job.  For allergy sufferers, it is critical that these areas be kept dust free and clean.  While trying to initially figure out why my motorized bridge stopped before grabbing the instructions, I figured it might be the canister since my handheld vac by a different company shuts off when the canister is full. I went to empty it but had problems and before you know it, the canister opened and dumped on me. I had to vacuum myself afterwards. Word of caution when emptying the canister, you need to pull your head back so as not to let the dust being emptied to plume into your face.  In the end, I barely vacuumed a room before calling it quits. My back hurt, my allergies were acting up, and nothing was getting very clean.  I still would need to keep my older vacuum because I could not picture carrying this heavy vacuum up and down the stairs. Also due to the lack of attachments with this vacuum, I still need other attachments that my other machine has.  There is a positive side believe it or not. The cord is plenty long enough reaching a few feet allowing you to not have to unplug and plug back in for every room.  While it is not truly anti-allergy if you come into contact with the stuff when emptying out the canister, I still like the bagless feature. My older vacuum came from a retail store and I can't get the bags anywhere else but their store and I pay a lot for them.  The Samsung Vacuum also transitions from rug to floor and back again pretty well.  All in all, this vacuum is not worth the investment. You still need a vacuum to reach under furniture and for the attachments, if you use them. If you have a lot of hair, you will need to use another vacuum or the handheld if it can accommodate it. I hate the chore of cleaning to begin with so this item just makes it that much worse for me. I cannot recommend this vacuum.
Does not clean carpet well  Though impressed with several nice features on this vacuum at the store, it fell short on the key issue: It could not pick up particles on my carpet. Here are the details:  We have handmade oriental carpets. That should make them easy to clean because they are short, not shag.  But, even loose cotton fibers from my husband's socks were a challenge for this vaccum on the two carpet settings.  The only setting that could pick up these fibers was the bare floor setting, but using that setting was like pushing a ton of bricks across the carpet. One try and I knew this vacuum was a mistake, so I will return it. Very dissapointed. Even so, it did have two very nice features.  First, the wand was not only the flexible hose, but included an attached wand that extended with a push of a button.  Attachments fit at the end of this long wand (making it easy to reach the floor).  Alternatively, one could easily detach the handle from the wand, though the full wand must be out of the holder for suction.  Second, the wand was not just the flexible hose -- it was a piece of metal with an extendable plastic attachment which stayed on all the time so you don't need to futz with it.  This was the primary reason I bought the vacuum in the first place, but what good is a vacuum that can't pick up particles on a carpet? No good at all. I will buy another Kenmore canister vacuum with quick release wand. Those always work great for 10 years, sometimes longer. And, they are cheaper than this one. Overall, I was VERY dissapointed with this vacuum and do not recommend it to anybody who has short pile carpets.
Large dust buster- Not vacuum  I live in a small New York city apartment and sadly this does not have enough power for that. It is basically a dust buster with an extension. I am very surprised that it received so many good reviews. The attachment does not have moving brushes. It is an extension to the hose. Also, one of the wheels fell off within the first month. I would have returned it, however,  I live in the city going to UPS and shipping it would cost close the the actual price. Just waste of money overall.
Save your $$$  I bought this vacuum because I have two cats, a lot of carpeting and I wanted the best, however, I'm very disappointed in its performance.  It works just as well but not better than my last vacuum cleaner that only cost 150$.  For the price of the Dyson, I assumed it would pick up everything it went over, yet it doesn't.  I recommend consumers to save a lot of money and buy a vacuum that's priced more reasonably as this Dyson certainly doesn't outperform other well rated cleaners!
Great on Carpet Only  Great on carpet, but doesn't do well on hard floors. The beater bar does not turn off either. The hand held beater bar is "air powered" and doesn't do much at all. If you are only vacuuming carpet, this would be a great vacuum. If you plan to vacuum anything else, I would get something else.
This "pet" vacuum clogs nearly every time I use it, with just cat hair.
At LEAST try this one before Dyson  Only giving 4 stars because I just purchased this vacuum today at my local store.  However, if this vac performs everyday like it did today, 5 stars would be in order.  Trust me, I've had many vacuums including just about every Dyson there is.  Do yourself a favor, try this Hoover first.  It's several hundred dollars less but the performance, even though it's only the first day, is quite impressive.  I personally don't like the feel of the self-propelled feature, I prefer it off.  When vacuuming, you can feel the power and the cleaning.  It has a much firmer feel than any Dyson I've ever used.  UPDATE:  Self propel feature already broken.  Didn't even last a year.  If that is the main reason for buying this vacuum....keep shopping!
Does not work well for pet hair  Product says that it does well with pet hair.  Not the case.  The motor can not handle pet hair and stops working after a few runs.  Very unsatisfied with this product.
We used it maybe 10 times in 5 months and it no longer sucks up water.  First impression is good. Got it to wash the tile floors since they're always dirty from my 3-year-old twin boys and 2 cats. Hardest part of assembly was getting it out of the box. Lightweight. Very easy to maneuver (kinda like a swivel handle even though it isn't). I like how it is loose and the handle goes up and down as you go forward and backwards. I have back problems and wasn't bothered by it. Didn't pick up all the water, but what was left was dry in under 5 minutes so the first part was dry before I finished the room. Clean and dirty water compartments are both easy to open/fill/rinse. Only complaint so far is that the hooks to hold the cord could be a bit bigger.
Vacuum died after 2 years with minimal use  I bought this vacuum 2 years ago and I am sorry to say it is dead.  I thought overall it did a decent job with my one dog and hair, but I am VERY disappointed that it didn't last!  I didn't overuse it either as I use the Neato BotVac daily for vacuuming (which is awesome for pet hair) and this was used every 2 weeks when my housecleaner came.  So to spend 150.00 on it and not make it that long or last is very disappointing.
ITS NOT WHAT IT IS!!!  It's not what it is. It's small, the bag small, small hose, terrible reach, poor suction, not worth it at all. It reads as a commercial vacuum, but it should read you vacuum. Bought it because I needed something compared or that did the same job as my old Oreck Mighty Might, I thought this was going to be as better or the same,but don't be fulledd by the name.
DYSON VACUME  Don't buy from DISCOUNTED PRODUCTS ONLINE . THEY SOLD ME A SO CALLED NEW VACUUM, 2012 WAS A 2008 WITH A BROKEN CLUTCH ,IT COSTS ME $125 TO FIX .WHEN I CONTACTED THEM I WAS TOLD TO SHIP IT BACK TO DYSON AT A CHARGE OF 45 BUCKS EACH WAY .THEY HAD TO KNOW IT WAS BROKEN ,WHEN I RAN IT IT MADE A NOISE THAT GOT WORSE EVERY TIME .STEER CLEAR OF THESE GUYS
doesn't really suck as good as I was hoping.  I wouldn't get a Hoover again.
Makes way too much noise.  I purchased this to replace my old Hoover because it was self-propelled and my old Hoover was not.  This vacuum seems cheap.  It looks cheap.  The embedded dirt finder appears not to work.  On my old Hoover, the embedded dirt finder always worked turning from red to green.  This wind tunnel is always on green even when it picks up visible debris.  Surprisingly, I happened to open the bag and discovered it had come loose and blowing dirt into the compartment and filter was full of dirt.  No indication light came on telling me the bag had come loose.  Again, now I think I will have to watch this to make certain it does not come off again.  One last point, this vacuum seems very loud--louder than my old Hoover.  That is rather annoying.  On the whole, I am not impressed with this vacuum.  **Approximately one year later, my opinion has changed regarding this vacuum.  I can't stand the noise level.  The vacuum is just too loud.  It is horrible.  While I like the self-propel option, it is the noise that ruins this machine.  Am now looking for another vacuum cleaner that will be quieter.
didn't suck well.  lasted a few weeks. Seals were off, didn't suck well...  Then a crap piece of plastic broke and I threw it in the trash in rage.  NEVER BUYING BLACK & DECKER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!  Waste of money, our new Dyson sucks 10x better and is made with quality.
Bought this for our cabin, its pretty worthless. When you are on hard floors it just spews the crumbs all over. Would not recommend.
First and last Dyson I will ever buy.  First and last Dyson I will ever buy. It is great at pulling dust from the carpets. It is a complicated system (over engineered) that has too many opportunities to break, and it will.  The brush's drive belt is worn on mine.  Dyson only sells an entire head assembly for over $120. I'll spend that much on a competitor vacuum every three years and never have maintenance issues again.
Box was taped shut like someone returned it  After opening it and assembling it, it turned out a part was not glued to the rest of the vacuum.  Maybe that's why it was returned and than shipped to me.  NOT NICE.  I will attempt to glue this because shipping it back is a  pain in the butt.  Quality control is obviously not a big deal to this manufacturer.
Disappointed  Did not have good suction and the mopping seemed to get the floor too wet and not dry it up enough. Keep using what you were using before. Just not worth it, we returned the item.
After three months it started making a very loud noise and would not pick up anything.  Worthless
Returned  I was totally dissatisfied with this vacuum.  It was too heavy for me to manage because of the self-propelled motor Thanks to Amazon,  my return was uneventful.
PLASTIC JUNK  Don't waste your time with this.  It arrived with one missing part, 2 of the 3 screws were too big to fit,  the dirt cup could not be properly affixed.and the hose attachment was not air tight.  It is just a piece of plastic junk.
not very happey overall  This vacuum is a great vacuum but finding a belt replacement I have found to be impossible I have looked all over town and the internet trying to find a replacement and haven't found one yet. Can't even get it at Hoover's web site.  It they don't have it then who will.  I feel like I wasted my money on the vacuum because I can't even replace the belt when needed.  So I bought it new for $250 and can't use it after 8 months because I need to replace the belt and can't find one ANYWHERE!!!!!!
serious design flaws and easily broken neck  Design flaws such as hose that easily crimps and no power switch on handle are annoying, but the fragile and easily broken handle is intolerable.  After one year the attachment point between the power brush and the handle cracked and fractured. Took it to a repair shop, tech said it was a very common problem with this model. After another 3 months of use, it cracked and failed again.  The weight of the power head is too much for the flimsy handle.  A deeply flawed design and a very disappointing product. Never again!
Vacuum itself is very good  I generaly love this vacuum the on isue i had with this product is that it said that it was new but when i received it was actually used,, i never had a issue with this vacuums and i buy  a few a year.
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT  It only worked for 2 mins and started smelling of burning !!! Terrible product. Really hard to return and contact seller
Do not buy this vacuum. After 1 month of use this vacuum lost it's suction and the wheel fell off. We contacted Eureka and they would not fix or replace the item.
Good except for bad (yes very bad) sound.  Very good vacuum if you don't mind the very high pitched sound. I wanted to keep it but could not. Wasn't worth it. Sent it back after one use.
Buying refurbished is Luck of the Draw -- I was not lucky  I was so excited to buy this refurbished Dyson. I read all of the reviews and it seemed too good to be true. It was! I ordered my vacuum and chose free super saver shipping. It took nearly TWO weeks to get the vacuum. It came in an unmarked box and contained no packing slip, no owner's manual, nothing. Two accessories were broken, not in working order. I'm not sure if the canister part fit correctly, because there was NO owner's manual. I didn't even turn the vacuum on, because I didn't want to use it if I was going to return it for these reasons. I purchased the extended warranty that was sold with the vacuum on Amazon. I called the company to inquire about getting the parts fixed, because the vacuum came with no contact information. They told me that my vacuum is NOT COVERED, because it is refurbished. They don't cover refurbished vacuums. It seems to me that they are selling warranties that they have no intention of honoring. They should not be sold with this vacuum. So, I am returning my vacuum, and now I have to go through a lengthy cancellation process with the warranty company. I will bite the bullet and buy the Dyson new. Then maybe I can actually write a review on the product!
Great suction, messy and awkward to clean.  We have had this vacuum for about one and half years.  It replaced a Hoover self-propelled that died after 10 years.  We have a lot of dogs (five at last count). That means dog hair is everywhere, and lots of dust too.  This vacuum does a great job pulling dog hair off carpet.  The four floor height adjustments are easy to access from the handle.  Rolls well.  However, the hose and wand are too short.  Brush and crevice tools are very small.  This vacuum is not well suited for anything but carpeted floors.  The worst thing about this vacuum is the dust bin/cyclone system.  Hair gets wrapped around the "tree".  The dust bin has to be emptied 4 or 5 times every time we clean. It can be difficult to close and latch the dust bin cover.  Don't forget to reinsert that "tree".  We have to go outside to the garage to empty it because there is so much dust that gets all over when emptied into the kitchen waste can.  Dust clings to all of the interior plastic.  Cyclone tubes clog with pet hair.  Cleaning the cyclone tubes requires unscrewing about 8 screws and then blowing it out with an air compressor.  There may be better bagless vacuums.  For us, we are going back to bags.
To weak to clean  This vacuum cleaner simply does not have enough suction.  I was using it without the HEPA filter to try to get it to suck a little harder. Also: - because it's light it rolls over very easily - the chord does not retract (I know it's only $80 but for a canister this is kind of important)   We returned ours.
Sucks good ,but Sucks Bad  Well when I bought it at the beginning, I was pleased of how light it was, how well it sucked up all the dirt and determined whether the dirt was cleaned up from the carpet. As I got along with cleaning it each time, I put the dust into a trash bag and as I go along cleaning the filters, replacing the HEPA Filter, the more the equipment would get dusty in the cracks of the vacuum. After you clean up all the equipment look how much dust remains on the vacuum itself. Pretty nasty. I have a Bissell in every part of my floor cleaning needs. I have their Carpet cleaner and just a general carpet sweeper that is non-electric. I'm sorry I cannot recommend this kind of vacuum. It is messy and a chore to clean up. I will never go with a bagless anymore. It was the coolest thing at first, but its extremely unhealthy for me to keep dumping toxic dust particle in a trash bag holding my breath. I am putting this in Craigslist if anyone wants it and I am going with Hoover. Its sturdy and it really does the job. You will never see a mess with their products. Yes They are a little heavy, but It will last me a long time.  Happy Cleaning!
Dont waste your money.  I bought this in May 2017 and 10 months later its going in the trash. The handle where it attaches to the vacuum cracked and the motor on the roller brush stopped working. The wheel fell off and my son-in-law had to superglue it on. Because I bought this from a third-party vendor on Amazon Hoover refused to honor the warranty. It is easy to use in very convenient. The lithium ion batteries do not last 50 minutes though more like 30. Thats OK because I generally got what I needed to get done in that time. Section was OK but you had to have the roller brush on and rotating before it would pick up anything. Its a real shame Hoover put such an unacceptable product on the market and will not back its warranty. I will not buy hoover again and I strongly suggest that you think twice before buying this vacuum even though there were a lot of positive reviews on it. Look at the percentages of positive against the percentages of the other level of stars.
this is a lot of work for very little cleaning power. the brushes really do not scrub anything more than a damp mop. I wanted it to clean tile flooring but it doesn't work for that at all.
Would not turn on after 6 months.  Called Hoover and told me to take it to a repair center 55 miles one way where I dropped it off.  10 days later they replaced it, did not repair it.  On the replacement, the brushes were not what I had on when I dropped it off.  NOW, I have to buy brushes that I all ready bought for $45.00
The hose is too short!!!!
The floor suction does not seem to work  The floor suction does not work well.  Had to update my experience because now the vaccum stopped working. Horrible experience. I would like a refund.
Awful vacuum  Worse vacuum I've ever bought, wish I would have sent it back. Does not pick up anything . Where the spinning head is I have to clean by hand the dirt gets stuck in the beater bar and you have to pull it out all the time.
I do not recommend this product  I bought this product after reading the reviews.  I regret it.  The sucking power is weak even on a very flat carpet and when you put it to the maximum it overheats and stops. At the beginning the filter in the back snapped out. I had to fix it.  You have to empty the vacuum after every room.  I do not recommend this product.
broke quickly  TERRIBLE QUALITY:  My mom bought this for me at Costco after I had done lots of research.  We didn't get to test it out because the models are locked in place.  It replaced my cheap and efficent Sharp vacuum that I had used for 12 years.  I couldn't believe how heavy it was.  It doesn't have a direct drive so moving it back and forth takes effort (I'm a strong person - but my Sharp was s nice and easy).  After 3 months with use about 1 time a week the hose broke and I duck-taped it together.  After 6 months the on/off switch broke so when it is plugged in, it is on.  Now a year and half later the carpet aggitator broke.  I've replaced many belts in my years and I replaced this belt but that wasn't the problem.  I'm happy it broke because now I have an excuse to get a good vacuum.  Don't waste your money.
Bad if used in Encino CA  I live in Encino CA and I just purchased the purple Dyson animal.  I have to say that at first I thought I was buying the "Next Big Thing" in home cleaning - I was wrong.  Not only does this purple piece of plastic not do all the things it claims to do, but it destroyed my entire life.  After plugging the Dyson animal in to test it at home - all the lights went out.  There is nothing in the manual that lets you know how many watts this purple piece of whatever has.  Ok, so I may have had a few holiday lights on at the time; Christmas tree, candles in each window, 9' electric Santa and all 8 reindeer, 3 CD players playing Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanza music, maybe a few inflated snow and gingerbread men out on the lawn and the rest of the exterior covered in bulbs.  But the fact is that once I plugged the purple Dyson animal in my lights went out, the fuse box blew and the Christmas tree (next to my lit menorah) went up in flames.  All the presents under the tree, the tinsel on the tree, stockings by the fireplace - all went up in flames.  The firemen told me later that there is a low watt area in Encino CA and that the purple Dyson animal often has problems with this.  If I ever suggest anything to anyone about a product I say this - If you live in Encino California, do not buy the purple Dyson animal, the green one works much better!
Terrible...did not pick up kitty litter.  I returned it.
Meh  I mean, it does a good job cleaning, but you have to clean the vacuum out so much that it's a hassle. Dump the chamber, wash and rinse that out. Pop the brush out. Wash and rinse, also let dry otherwise it smells moldy. Wash and rinse the base. Too much work for something that claims to simplify.
Very much disappointed.  I've experienced good products from Panasonic.  However, the Panasonic MC-CL310 isn't worth their effort.  It's another Southeast Asia plastic pos.  Do yourself a favor, spend a little more, and get something that doesn't look like a kid's toy, and probably not last as long.
Completely stopped working after three months.
Junk  This thing sucks. ( no pun intended) won't pick up any pet hair.
All of those attachments. Don't go with the sentria 2
Just bought and used after my old vacuum died. I'm not sure I like it. It seemed to pick up a lot but so did my old one. It is lightweight and that is partially why I don't like it. its almost to light. It also doesn't edge clean at all. I have a fully carpeted house animals and kids. The canister is way to small. I couldn't vacuum my whole house with out  emptying the canister.  You can not vacuum rugs with the roller on and what's the point of vacuuming if you cant use the roller. Suction alone doesn't pick up hair.  I'm trying to figure out why it's a $200 vacuum.
The ad sounds great but this is a very light vacuum  The ad sounds great but this is a very light vacuum. Not for deep cleaning. There is no rotater bar so does not lift dirt.
Not very good  The first 2 times I used my hoover wet/dry vacuum I ended up with blisters on my thumbs from pushing the  the soap dispenser.  Plus it seems to suck the soap cleaner up before it cleaned the floor.  I'm back to using my $9.99 sponge mop.
Rather disappointed  This vac picks up very well.  However, the tube won't stay on the machine,keeps coming off. And it is really  hard to get the contanier off to enpty.  Might have to return it - don't want to work so hard to use a product.
Worthless  Absolutely worthless.  Couldn't return it fast enough.
worst vaccum ever  I bought my Dyson over a year ago and have been severely disappointed after all the great reviews.  The vaccum attachment hose doesn't work and the vaccum itself doesn't pick up like it claims to.  I would spend the extra money on a Kirby or Oreck, much better vaccums.
Motor gave out in one month!  Quit working after only having it a month.  The motor won't even turn on.
Don't expect it to clean a dirty floor...  It did not do the expected job! i had to scrub with a manual scrubber again!
Good while it lasted  I had this unit for almost exactly 2 years before it broke. You are purchasing a disposable cleaner as Hoover does not make replacement parts for it. Be advised. The water intake hose became brittle and cracked open. I spent 10 minutes waiting for Hoover to answer the phone. They then advised me that my cleaner will need to be taken in to an authorized repair place. She proceeded to provide me with the repair place's phone number. Never once did she think to mention that this vacuum is intentionally a disposable model. Hoover does not and never has made replacement parts for it. So I had to call the repair place to find this out for myself. He says that Hoover was sold to China sometime ago and now has horrible customer service. He said that many of these types of vacuums are now being made to be disposable. The repair expert told me that this goes for pretty much every brand now. The problem is that they only last for about a year. I got 2 years out of mine so I consider myself lucky. The best advice is to purchase a floor cleaner at Sam's Club or Costco. That way right before the thing is a year-old you can return it and get a new one.
Not New! Refurbished  Well, the title says it all! Buyer beware. As unpacked the item, it had appeared to be opened before. When I got to the instructions package after taking everything out, I found a letter from Dyson stating thank you for purchasing our refurbished vacuum cleaner! I was totally annoyed, as I have to repackage and now send back to Amazon. I did call Amazon, and the customer service rep was awesome, and he too seemed annoyed that this happened. Sending it back, and hopefully will get a new one this time!  Obviously, this review is not a critique of the item, but I want to make folks aware to check when they purchase, to assure the item is new!
Lack of longevity  This thing doesnt last. We vacuum maybe once a week. After 8 months or so the suction is gone. Get what you pay for when it comes to vacuums. Weve owned two sharks and neither of them have lasted more than a year.
Don't bother! Manufacturer defect and waste of time!  I can't even write about the product itself because I couldn't even get the darn thing assembled! They sent a screw that doesn't meet the thread so you can't attach the handle. I attempted to call Hoover but after being on hold for 45 mins and still no customer service, I hung up. After doing some research I found that others had the same issue with the screw, and that the only solution Hoover gave was to take it to a repair shop. Repair something brand new??? I think not! I should have never swayed from my Bissell, this is what I get!
Didn't last long. I already need a new vacuum
Extremely hard to push when vacuuming carpet! Exhausting!!  Vacuum power is good but it is extremely hard to push the vacuum when using it on carpet. I would not buy it again. It's too difficult to use and leaves you exhausted after vacuuming a room with carpet.
Wand arm kept breaking apart when trying to clean carpet.
Worst vacuum  Worst vacuum ever!! I clean daily, everyday, this vacuum is not for frequent use! It clogs easily,  filter does not filter at all, doesn't pick up as good as advertised! I will stick with my Dyson which is the best vacuum I have ever owned! I don't know what I was thinking , no vacuum can ever beat a Dyson!
underpowered
Did not come with screws for the handle.  Did not come with screws for the handle. we had to go to Home depot and buy new ones
Glad it went out before the one year warranty  10 months of use and the motor burnt out. Glad it went out before the one year warranty. Authorized repair shop told me hoover filed for bankruptcy a while back and now they are being made in China. He also stated they have been getting quite a few of these being returned with the same issue. Now have to wait two+ weeks to get it repaired. Not too happy.
Broke after 3 months  Broke after 4 months. So disappointed. Felt chintzy and cheap when it arrived and I gave it the benefit of the doubt. Now it's useless  and I'll have to buy another one.
Terrible product  This is the worst vacuum I have ever purchased.  The wheels constantly fall off and all efforts to get them to stay on have been for nothing.  It definitely does not have the power my old Hoover did and certainly not worth the having the cordless feature.  The battery will not charge long enough to do the carpet in a 2500 square foot house.  We have to do half the house and then switch batteries which are large and clunky and we charge them in the garage to be out of sight.  I will give it away to Goodwill.
flimsy goes off when hot. OK for small jobs. But about right for price.
Dyson DC25 Animal Ball-Technology Upright Vacuum Cleaner  This product is way overrated and it is way overpriced. Hoover makes a better product at a much lower price!
Long hard road...  I have had two of these vacuums (Eureka Capture with Pet Paw). The first one fell COMPLETELY apart within the first year. Little pieces just started falling off. They were inconsequential at first, the piece for looping the cord around, the rubber corner... But then major pieces just started falling off until it could not be used. It was useless within 8 months. It was still under warranty though so I drove it to the authorized dealer/repair shop. Eureka replaced the vacuum (as it was beyond repair). The second one lasted a bit longer but just about a year later little pieces started to break again, the corner pieces, the hose cracked... Eventually, the entire brushroll broke off. Technically, it was the plastic piece that holds the brush to the vacuum. The repair shop I use "rigged" it by welding a piece of metal into it for me. That actually held for about another 6 months or so. Last week the outside corner broke completely off the vacuum (I do note that the welded piece my shop put together is still holding). This corner keeps the brushroll from popping up out of the machine. Yes, the corner of the brushroll now will not stay inside the vacuum, making vacuuming impossible. I am not even going to try to repair it again. I am taking advantage of this event to buy a new vacuum. I must also mention that the "turbo brush" (or pet paw) has not worked in months. I have taken it apart, cleaned it, made sure there was no hair wrapped around it, but it will NOT get enough suction to work.  Nearly half of my house is hard flooring so I only use it to vacuum half of a house. I do vacuum a couple of times per week but I do nothing unusual or rough to the machine- plug it in, turn it on, push it back and forth... It is EXTREMELY heavy and loud as well. I absolutely do not recommend this machine.
Not good broke a month later
Good potenial  Just got this the other day to take care of the fur from my two Maine Coon cats.  The instructions were not very helpful and the screws had to be found inside the box as they became detached and floated away during shipping. Have someone who is unfamiliar with your product try and assemble your vacuum, part of marketing.  The two stage bag-less feature is not so good.  When you empty the lower container all the dust, hair and derby from above falls back down.  This was not an issue of over filling as I emptied it often. It was due to the cyclone like design that sucked the stuff up and into the top.  The dust and dander (from the HEPA filter?) escaped and collected on the outside of the waste containers near the HEPA filter.  I would wonder how much of it was just ejected into the air?  The "Turbo" brush was great, until I used it on the stairs.  I was unable to complete half the stairs before the hair from the cats got entangled inside the drive wheel.  To correct this you have to have a long handled screw driver to dis assemble the handle and pull out the hair.  It was caught everywhere inside the device.  The hair brush on the front of the vacuum cleaner was useless and only kept me from getting close to the wall and made nice brush marks on the carpet when I was done.  There is a leak in the hose if it is bend to far, which occurs because the plastic handle has an unnatural curve.  The soft bristles were the best and dies really pick up the cat hair.
Made of cheap brittle plasfic  Made of cheap plastic, broke when unwrapping. Hard to put together. I am returning it for a refund.
Disappointing Vacuum Cleaner!  I have had this vacuum for almost a year and have been nothing but disappointed with it. The only redeeming quality is the automatic cord return... The problems I've had are as follows: the battery compartment in the handle broke after the first month when I tossed the handle on the floor while in the middle of cleaning (I tossed the handle toward the floorI did not aggressively throw itnow I use duct tape to hold the handle batteries inside their case)... The debris reservoir it tinyI'm emptying it after every clean (which includes my car, or one or two rooms in the housenot big rooms). The cord is not long enough! I am always frustrated by this. If it were just a few feet longer, amazing cleaning could happen. The vacuum does not follow along easily as I'm cleaningit ends up flopping onto its bellythe side without wheelsand I end up dragging it along as I clean. Very annoying. Before owning this vacuum, I had a cheap sanitaire, which had a longer cord and NEVER got plugged up with debris. The Bissell gets clogged so easily. I would not reccomend this vacuumsave yourself the frustration!
Can't remove the handle!!! HELP!!  While the suction is great, the unit is too heavy and I thought for some reason, I suppose from looking at so many models before ordering this that I was getting a retractable cord. So I printed out the return labels and guess what? We cannot remove the handle from the unit to repack it! I have called CS and he didn't  have a clue other than to tell me to buy a bigger box! Seems odd there is no way and we have tried everything, read all of the instructions and even tried to unscrew things to get the handle to release. I am not going to pay my local vacuum center to remove this but what a PITA this has become. I want to replace this with another lighter Bissell but scared if it isn't right I will go through the same brain damage and my pea brain is damaged enough.  And the worst part is,  I may have to get my stupid Dyson back to the shop and repair it and wait for the next "expert engineering" failure to occur. I have had this dyson in the shop five times in three years. I hate it and wanted to love a Bissell. Can anyone tell me how to remove this danged handle?
great vacuum......shoddy material  I love the vacuum.  It picks up everything and does a great job. I almost have to vacuum on my knees.  The adjustable handle doesn't stay locked in place so everytime I push on it, it goes down to the shortest length.  THAT DOES NOT make me happy.
This is the second one I purchased. The first one arrived after clearly being opened prior. The lip of the hose was bent so it could not be used. Returned that and got a second one. Everything worked perfectly for 30 seconds after which the motor in the rug piece stopped working. I bought an Electrolux vacuum cleaner because of positive prior experience but 2 out of 2 failures is too much.
Strap not strong enough  The strap broke while strapped around shoulder. It fell to the floor and after that it would not turn off by the switch. It also overheats once in a while.
I have had his vacuum for less than 6 months and it already stopped working!?!
Worst Vacuum and Customer Service Experience Ever  I was so excited when my new vacuum came. I took it out to use it and it seemed to work well. It was small and lightweight, which I need because of health problems. The first down side is there was an immediate smell of burning plastic. I should have quit while I was ahead. Then I turned it off, unplugged it, and went into another room. I started using it again and there was a loud pop and it just quit working. It was making noise but there was no suction. Nothing got sucked up in it (I had literally just swept the floor I was using it on but wanted to pick up some loose hair that didn't sweep up as easily as it should have vacuumed up). I checked everything and could find no clogs or anything obviously wrong with it.  I called customer service that day (keep in mind this is the day I received it from the shipper) and the first rude thing they said to me was ask why I waited so long to call, even after I had told her that I just received it that day. Then she listed off 3 local repair shops I could take it to. I ended up taking it to 2 of those within the next few days. Both places wanted to charge me more than I payed for the vacuum to even look at it and both told me that Eureka would most likely not cover the costs.  I called their customer service again five days after my first call, after I had taken it to the repair shops and asked if there was anything they could do to replace or refund me for this vacuum that basically arrived dead. The woman I was speaking to asked me to hold on while she forgot to put me on hold or press mute and held a conversation with someone there where they were joking around and not talking about their job at all, she finished with "Hold on let me get rid of this lady". In the end she basically told me there was nothing she could do.  I will never buy a Eureka vacuum again. I work in customer service myself and wouldn't have a job anymore if I talked to people the way their customer service reps talked to me. This piece of junk vacuum doesn't even deserve the 1 star I'm forced to give it. Buyer beware!
Piece of junk  Brand new and it quit working after just a couple of months, no suction, loudest vacuum I've ever heard.  We threw it out and bought a Shark Navigator that is just awesome.
Power head  dead  Got this vacuum from Amazon at the end of January 2016.  Worked fine for 2 1/2 months when the power head stopped working. Told by a repair shop the motor in the head was burnt out. Very disappointing.
Would not buy it again, I don't think  Delivered: May 16th Belt broke and I had to put on a new one on:  June 2nd It seems to vacuum well although it is heavy -- something which makes cleaning stairs difficult.  I would probably change my rating if I don't have to replace another belt on but considering the fact that they sent a belt along with it, leads  me to believe they know there is a problem.  Less than a month before it shredded is totally unacceptable.
works great the first few weeks  We have 3 kids and a dog so we were in need of a good vacuum. The first week it worked great but that was short lived after pieces slowly started breaking and we had to change/rinse off the filter every time. First the hose adhesive came unglued on the hose and then the hose clip/holder broke after falling backwards once...very cheaply made. We've had a dyson for the past 6 years and loved it but we're looking for a smaller vacuum that was more lightweight like the smaller dyson...but cheaper. Well we got what we payed for. Dyson is worth the $$$ if you use a vacuum as much as we do.
Great for 2 months....  This product worked great in the first few months and then slowly started going downhill.  We've had it for 6-8 months now and it can barely lift anything off the carpet. This should NOT happen with a vacuum that quickly while it is being used in a normal household setting.
Pricey for what it does....  Well, I bought this vacuum when it was still new on the market, and it was very pricey at about $300.  It definately wasn't worth it, and probably won't buy another one.  The vacuum fills too fast, clogs too easily, and isn't too sturdy.  As a matter of fact, I'm now searching for a new and more sturdy vacuum.  Yesterday, the electrical cord came out of the vacuum itself.  If you are looking for a really good vacuum, this really isn't the way you want to go.  It's very highly over rated.  It does pick up a lot off of the floor, but it's really not worth the money if you want something that will last.
Too much trouble. Was hoping brushes would actually do something.
Not a good purchase.  The power of this vacuum is good and the amount of dirt and pet hair it picks up a year after purchase is really great. What absolutely ruins this vacuum is the refuse disposal system. As this is bagless, the entire canister containing the filters and dirt cup disconnects from the main unit. There is a button on the side of the container that opens the dirt cup from the bottom, which causes the dust and hair to drop into the garbage. In theory. Since the dirt cup doesn't come completely out, and the filter sits inside, you end up having to reach into the canister to pull down the hair that is stuck in a lump up inside the container. This causes all of the dirt and dust you just vacuumed up to come spilling out all over your hand, the garbage, the floor and any nearby objects. It gets everywhere EVERY SINGLE TIME. To get the remaining dirt out of the canister you need to shake it, which again makes a mess, and when you are finally ready to close the bottom, a plume of dust escapes from the "lid" that got completely covered in it because it is on a hinge. It's ridiculous. Buy a vacuum with a dirt cup that can be completely removed and whose filter doesn't descend into the cup, causing the hair to get stuck. I'm so disappointed in this purchase.
Not very easy to clean  Not as powerful as advertised.  Cant stand by itself.  Always have to prop up against a wall to remain upright.  Not very easy to clean. So sorry I made the purchase.
useless and too big for me  no suction...literally...useless and too big for me,(older citizen) to return via UPS srore...
Not so impressed...its okay  This vacuum is just okay...I don't know. So, it can swivel and pivot. Big deal. Yes, it is lighter and smaller than my old Bissel vacuum, HOWEVER, the powerful dyson suction (it was supposed to have) is nothing compared to my old Bissel pet vacuum that I've had for about 6 years now. It is a nicer looking vacuum than my Bissel, but I'm sorry. It does not out-perform my old vacuum. My carpets look/feel cleaner only when I use my Bissel, and so does my cat's tower which is always covered in fur. When I use the Dyson it does not pick up everything it should and I have to go over areas more than once. The little dyson is mostly used for quick cleans or in rooms with less traffic and pet hair. This vacuum is way over-priced and I would consider buying something else if you have kids, pets, etc. If you live in a nice studio apartment by yourself and just want something small to put in your closet, then this is your vacuum. Its just really expensive. If my Bissel breaks, then I plan on buying another Bissel. I'm not impressed with the Dyson at all.
On my second machine within 6 mo and this is going back  First, I will say when this machine works, it works great.  It scrubs the floor well and sucks all the dirty water right up so your grout stays clean.  It is not as easy as vacuuming your floor because it requires more effort but it is certainly much better than mopping.  My issue with this machine is after a few weeks, is stop sucking up the water and you got a mess.  I returned it and got another.  It worked fine again for a for weeks and again started leaking and not sucking up the water.  This time I am going with a different brand.
I Will Never Do Business with Eureka Again!  I have had two of these units. The first one died during it's third use (my apt is only about 700 sq feet.) The store I purchased it at had 90 day policy, so it was replaced by them promptly. Four months later, another unit failure!  Eureka Headquarters of Peoria, Illinois have HORRIBLE customer service policies.  After realizing that I wasn't willing to travel 1 hour 55 minutes to have it serviced, they offered to send me a new unit(gosh, thanks!), but only AFTER THEY CONFIRM that they have received 6 inches of the plug from the unit that they made ME ship at my own cost! I have spoken to Customer Service over half a dozen times.... It's been 5 weeks.... no new unit yet... Glad my business is appreciated.
Burned my carpet  I have had this vacuum for a month now.  Last week I had the wand attachment hooked up and I was vacuuming a shelf.  It didn't take long, but the motor got hot and the vacuum tipped slightly back burning a hole in my new carpet.  The irony is thick.  Be wary of the hot motor.  Other than that the vacuum works well so far.
It sucks; no, wait, it doesn't  It sucks. Or rather, it doesn't suck. Not only does it have poor suction, it's poorly designed. You have to vacuum twice: once to pick up the dirt/dust, and then again to pick up the dirt/dust that was blown all over the place. It smells like burning and it's heavy and awkward. Looks great, has good tools, but what's the point?
This vacuum worked for approximately  3 minutes before it quit .
Sadly, this vacuum doesn't suck!  absolutely horrible! stopped working and blew the circuit during first use. I would say it sucks, but in this case - it doesn't.
Did not work!  First one would start and shut off in 15 seconds. Many attempts later I returned it for a replacement. The replacement did the same thing and it turns out that Hoover was aware of the problem. Amazon please stop selling this piece of crap.
Don't like as much as my old Dyson  The ball vacuum doesn't clean as well as the regular Dyson on carpet.  If you had a original Dyson, you are not going to like the ball. The ball works well on hard surfaces, but doesn't clean carpet very well.  The cord is much shorter - why did they shorten it, that was one of the really nice features of Dyson??.  The new DC25 Ball vacuum feels cheap.  With the amount of money you spend on it you want something that feels like it will last, the DC25 Ball misses that mark.
Worst vacuum cleaner I've ever owned  Worst vacuum cleaner I've ever owned.  Doesn't clean well and wand is almost impossible to remove.  I'm throwing it in the garbage!!!! GRRRRR!
TERRIBLE FOR MEDIUM OR HIGH PILE CARPETS!  It was time to replace my 10 year old bagless hoover. I wanted something that was truly bagless with no HEPA filters, and I found this Dyson. I heard good things about Dyson and decided to take a chance. It arrived in a plain cardboard box but was packaged well enough. I quickly put it together and immediately noticed the tangle-free attachment was missing. When I plugged it in and turned it on, I thought Dyson was playing a joke on me. It would not push through my medium to high pile carpet. I thought it was supposed to self-adjust for the carpet height. Instead it just sucked itself down into the carpet and would not budge. I looked for any adjustments and found none. I researched online and some people had luck removing a rubber seal in the powerhead. I tried it but it made very little difference. Other people drilled holes in their Dyson to relieve the pressure. I am not going to drill into my brand new vacuum! However, when I tried it on my very low pile area rugs and it moved well enough, but by no means is easy to push. Dyson should come with a warning, "NOT FOR MEDIUM OR HIGH PILE CARPETS!"
Extremely Disappointed  I am a pet owner, multiple pets, multiple years of multiple pets, multiple vacuums over the years. My last vacuum was also a Hoover, a Windtunnel Air Lightweight which I quite liked, but it had a clip issue I didn't care for, so when it stopped working, I thought that I would check out some pet-specific machines. I looked at various online reviews, as well as Consumer Reports, and decided on the WindTunnel Pet because it was highly rated, and I had had good luck with my last Hoover.  Short version:  Pros: Works okay as an upright on floors Cons: Hand tools easily knocked out of their holders (even just by the movement of the vacuum itself), hose attachment for hand tools is too short to adequately clean furniture, pet fur tool works only on some types of fabrics, hand beater brush stopped working within three months.  Longer version:  I purchased the machine in early August of this year, and had a house full of cats (6) and dogs (5), plus the occasional guest pet. I wanted a chance to really use the Windtunnel Pet before I reviewed it, which is why I waited until now. From the beginning, there were things that annoyed me (that hadn't been a problem on the Windtunnel Air): The pet fur tool and the hand beater brush were both easily knocked out of their holders while I was vacuuming, so I was either picking them up, or setting them on a counter somewhere so I wouldn't be knocking into/stepping on them. The hose, even with the extender attachment, was very short--to get the back of my couch, I had to put the entire unit up on the seat cushions. To vacuum out the top of the cat towers, I had to stand on a chair and hold the entire vacuum about shoulder height in one hand, while wrangling the hose-and-hand tool with the other. Standing on the chair didn't bother me so much, but the shortness of the hose did, because it made the entire thing more awkward (and as for the back of the couch--I really think it should have reached that far from the floor; cat towers can be very tall, but my couch is not that tall or deep). A lot of pet fur clean up falls to the hand attachment and tools, so the short hose was disappointing as it seemed like the machine was not truly designed for pet fur cleanup in mind. (Even if one does not allow one's pets on furniture, pet fur can get there.)  The pet fur tool itself wasn't very useful to me, but that has more to do with the fact that the rubber polymer it's made of works great on some fabrics, but not on others. My main furniture is made of a fabric that it doesn't work so well on, but I don't fault the machine for my choice in upholstery. It did work okay on one chair that has a different type of fabric.  The hand beater brush actually worked very well on my furniture, so I tended to use that--until two weeks ago, when the beater brush, which works via suction through the hose, stopped spinning. There is still definitely suction, but the brush seems stuck somehow, although I can't see how. A call to the Hoover helpline was less than helpful--the customer service rep kept insisting that because the brush spins via suction, there was obviously a problem within the machine impeding suction, despite my telling her that the suction could still pick up small objects; the brush just didn't spin. I think it annoyed her that I kept disagreeing with her, but... I was the one actually seeing what was happening. She got snappy with me and told me that since I "had gotten it so long ago" (since when is 3 1/2 months a long time in the life of a vacuum?), I would have to take the machine to a certified repair shop in my area. I asked how the warranty worked, and how the repair shop would handle warrantied parts, and was told snippily that first the repair shop would have to determine that the cause of the problem was actually part of the warranty. Great. I bought a sub-par machine, got less than 4 months out of it, and then very likely will have to pay money to make it actually work.  You may wonder why I gave this machine two stars, when I'm obviously unhappy with it. Using it on my hardwood floors as an upright machine has worked fine, and I haven't been disappointed with that aspect of it. But because I really need a machine that can clean pet fur off of furniture, I wouldn't purchase it again, and am currently wishing I had just bought another Hoover Windtunnel Air Lightweight--the clip issue it had did not annoy me nearly as much as the hand tool issues of this current Windtunnel Pet.
I used to love this vacuum :(  I know when I go online looking for reviews they are all about recent purchases. This one bought it yesterday, that one last week. I try to look for long term owners. Well here I am. I have had this vacuum about a year.  At first this was an awesome vacuum, maybe even for the first 7 months,it cleaned so well, had a ton of suction.  Then it happened....It lost suction,  I couldn't figure out why the cup wasn't filling up. I messed with it took hoses off cleaned the filters, blew the whole thing out with compressed air. Ok I got it going again,it worked...for about 10 minutes, had to take it apart again...10 minutes later,  clogged again...again and again this happened till I wanted to throw it out the window!!!!Then My husband tried to fix it..he took the whole thing apart, I thought he did it!, but alas...it worked  twice. And now i went to vacuum again and guess what! NO SUCTION!!!! I HATE THIS VACUUM! actually I hate ALL Vacuums ( except my parents 1953 Kirby, that thing is like a tank, and it still works!!!BUT its HUGE! and you cant find bags for it anymore)   I don't have a big house, or alot of carpeting, only 2 rooms are carpeted, I only have 1 short haired dog.   so now I am online looking at vacuum cleaner reviews again...   I guess the deal is , I have to buy a new stinking Vacuum every year. Maybe I should make it a permanent mothers day gift UGH!!
It worked great while it was functioning  I bought this in June and it's already dead. It worked great while it was functioning.
the vacuum cleaner has great suction. but that's not everything that's important  the vacuum cleaner has great suction. but that's not everything that's important.three main problems, the weight and awkwardness of the unit, the short hose and the main thing the cost of replacing the agitator brush is $300. it's nice not having a belt replace but it's definitely not worth spending $300 to replace the agitator which includes the motors to turn the brush. when the bristles wear out you will have to replace the agitator brush which includes the motors that are built in. I'd rather spend $3 on a belt.
probably the worst suction power in a vacuum out there, not worth even 40.00
Power cord shorted out  This was my third Dirt Devil in four years. The first one worked wonderfully until the power cord shorted out and started a small fire. The second one worked fine, and still does, but keeps loosing its wheels. The third one was bought on June 17 and again had a power cord short. It produced a big spark and scared my wife who was using it at the time. The short always occurs at the point where the cord enters the body of the vacuum cleaner. I think that I am going to buy another one and just put a rubber sleeve around the area to prevent the cable from fraying and twisting.
Worst vacuum I've ever owned.  I'm about to throw this disaster of a vacuum cleaner in the trash.  It operates fine, but it is the worst performing vacuum I've ever owned.  It will not pick up anything but dust.  The smallest bit of lint or fuzz will stay on the carpet no matter how loosely it sits (i.e., no fibers are tangled in the rug).  I usually go over the same piece of lint about ten or fifteen times before I finally pick it up by hand.  After doing this over and over for every piece of lint, it's more than frustrating.  Worse than that, it is a devil to maintain.  It's bagless, so that means you have to pull out the handy dandy dirt cup and you can quickly dump it in the trash.  However, when you do so, a pile of dust falls on the floor.  Then you have to pull out the plastic cyclone filter, which causes a small mountain of dust to fall on the floor and your hand gets caked in dirt.  And you practically have to turn the darned thing over line the filter up to insert it again, which gets your hands dirtier -- and you're lucky if the dirt doesn't get on your face.  Then, you have to pull out the foam rubber air filter and remove the caked on dust on it.  I spend more time cleaning up after vacuuming than I do on just vacuuming.  I will never buy a Eureka again, and everyone should beware this monstrosity posing as a labor saving device.  I've had it for almost three years and I'm only amazed I've taken this long to stop cussing it out and finally throw it away.
Shark Bagless Canister Vacuum  Terrible.  Stopped working the same day I got it.  I don't know what to do with it. Junk.
Not worth the money  Please do not waste your money on the name of this product! Just because some handsome foreigner comes on your television screen to tell you how dramatically engineered this machine is, that is no reason to be swept up (which the product does not do) and sucked into (the vacuum doesn't do that either) his salesmanship.  I bought the DC 25 in January, 2009.  By March, 2009, I was ready to have the blasted thing carted away from my home by the garbage men.  The only thing that kept it from the dump was that my college-age son had no vacuum at all and appreciated a machine that would at least pick up his roommate's sandwich scraps.  My housekeeper was the first to let me know what a cheap piece of machinery this was.  She liked the way it crept around corners, but she did not like its LACK OF SUCTION.  She said she had to go over spaces on the floor several more time than she had to with my Hoover that she used previously on her visits.  I vacuumed the carpet twice, perhaps four times, between her twice monthly visits.  With the Dyson, she noticed a remarkable lack of care.  One thing I noticed was the lack of ability to "fluff" my carpet back up.  My Hoover used to make my carpets look all new and fresh.  The Dyson keeps my carpet looking beat down and dirty.  Especially since I have pets, this is an important thing for me.  I do not want to feel like I need to replace my carpeting before it is time to do so.  My carpeting has a 15 year limited warranty. It has barely been nine years, and since I have been using the Dyson for the last 9 months, it looks terribly worse.  Also, I find the fact that it does not have "headlights" a discouraging point.  I have to turn every lamp and light on in every room to see what I am doing while I vacuum with the Dyson. They are cheap in this matter.  I know this review is getting very long, but there is one more important factor I must share with you.  I have a home carpet cleaner.  It is also a Hoover product.  I try to clean each carpeted room on a regular basis.  Since I have purchased the Dyson, I find that my carpet cleaner is filled with much more dog hair and soot than it used to have.  This tells me the Dyson vacuum is not picking up the dirt it claims to.  Don't waste your money.  Go back to what you trust for half the price.
I feel that I waste my money  It was a mistake to buy a used one. It came some pieces apart. I try to put together myself it works for a little bit and then fall apart again! I feel that I waste my money!
this vacuum blows  The suction was great but the filter is terrible. Everytime I used it I would have to re-dust because it blew dust everywhere.
Fire Hazard!!  I had the same problem as another Bissell owner. I noticed a burning smell and saw smoke while using the vacuum. After investigating, I noticed that one of the prongs had completely burned off the bottom of the canister and the connection on the base had burned as well. I immediately reported it to Bissell and they are sending a "remanufactured" replacement. The unit is 2 1/2 years old and out of warranty. While I am happy to get the machine replaced, I think they should have a recall on this model as it is certainly a safety hazard.  Not only that, it is very hard to maintain and the filters constantly have to be cleaned. I finally just went out and bought extras, so I can continue to use the unit while I wait 2 days for the washed filters to dry. I would think twice before purchasing this model.
Not Happy!  I've had my Eureka AS1000A for 1 yr and the motor started smoking, Further check indicated a spark and it was locked up. It worked well for a year but always had a high pitch that hurt my ears some, Unfortunately I didn't save my receipt during a move.
6 months and kaput  Ordered this cuz it was highly recommended in Consumer Reports.  It was extremely heavy!  I should have returned it immediately.  Instead, I held onto it and within 6-8 months it was broken.  I thought I had fixed it once, but it is not working again.  It might be something small but when a product breaks within a year .... there's a problem.
Hoover WindTunnel Product Specifications Misrepresented  [Hoover WindTunnel Self-Propelled Upright Vacuum with Pet-Hair Tool, Bagless, UH60010]]  Product specifications misrepresented: 1) No auto rewind cord storage; 2) Owner's Manual supplied with product contains obsolete information; 3) No *.pdf Owner's Manual available online from Hoover; 4) Actual cord length 2" shorter than advertised (31").  Attaching handle nearly impossibly difficult because screw holes are NOT pre drilled.  I recommend against purchase of this item.
didnt work
I am 3 days outside the return / replace timetable and the unit will not power on.  Unbelievable.  I convinced myself that for small areas like the stairs and baseboards it would be fine even though the hose is too short to maneuver the wand and the wand continually falls off the unit.  It is honestly not worth the money.  I bought 2 units at the same time one for upstairs and one for downstairs.  Let's see how long the second unit lasts.  Completely dissatisfied.
Very Disappointed with this product  Very Disappointed with this product. Bought on 04/02/16 and on 12/10/16 it is officially dead. Over $300 down the drain.....
good prefomace but falls apart  On the positive side it cleans very well and the bag is easy to change.  That said don't waste your money as it has countless design flaws that make it a pain to use.  The hose constantly falls off the handle because the cheap plastic hooks are not "closed" enough to hold the hose in place.  As other reviewers have noted the accessories constantly fall off when your are using the machine.  Cord storage hanger is held in place with a plastic rivet vs a screw or fixed plastic hook so it spins freely resulting in the coiled power cord falling off when trying to hang it for storage.  Too bad they mfg a good functioning motor and surrounded it by poorly designed junk.
Disappointed in one of our  Disappointed in one of our, we've already had to open 2nd one up, 1st one would not keep the brushes turning, unless you were banging it on the floor. I sure hope the 2nd one is in better shape.  We've own this type of vacuum for several years and Loved it, but sure was not happy with these last ones !
Worst hoover have ever owned  Absolutely no suction on vacuum setting, totally useless. So annoyed after a few tries that am ordering a different brand. Should have never bought it.
I wish I would have just spent a few more dollars for one much more recommended.  I can not give this vacuum a lower recommendation. . . when it does actually work, the bag less feature/ canister is way too small. But most of the time, it gets plugged up before the canister even gets full! For the price, well, I wish I would have just spent a few more dollars for one much more recommended.
To heavy and too messy  I used it once and it just made a big mess of water. It has the feature to go back and dry it but to me it was too heavy on my back and I was definitely not going to be doing double the work! I  ended up returning it and getting a steam mop.
Mickey Mouse Vacuum  This vacuum is Mickey Mouse, cheap thin plastic everywhere. The suction is very weak, and the plastic hose is so flimsy that if the hose is slightly twisted, it will pinch, thus no air flow. I returned it.
Too bad they use such cheap plastic  The hose part that attaches to the metal is plastic and broke within 2 weeks of use.  It was very powerful and the upholstery attachment was very effective.  Too bad they use such cheap plastic!!!
Worst Vacuum ever!!  First of all you can only swipe backwards with the vacuum.. ok that is do able. I has a good suction but it is very cheaply made. The hose comes out of the attachment bars constantly you can't really pull back without it falling out. Then today one of the attachment bars snapped on me I was hardly brushing.. What a waste of money, if it cannot stand up to every day vacuuming what is the use.. Totally getting a different one.
Buy something else!  This vacuum has great suction--this is the only good thing I have to say. It is VERY noisy and heavy. It took me quite awhile to assemble and in the process I broke the hose clip and couldn't get a screw in tight enough. When I was finally able to try it out, I was very impressed/horrified by the amount of dirt it got out of my carpet. When I went to empty the canister because the filter was getting clogged, I noticed a lot of dirt on the outside of the canister. I figured I did not install it correcty so I cleaned it up and tried again. Same thing happened and the dirt was all compacted around the spinning filter. I took it back and bought a Dyson--still not perfect but a lot better.
Ordered in January...Worked Great for a Week...Worked OK for 2 months...Now it's broken  Was so impressed at first...suction felt great, worked amazing for vacuuming pet fur.  Suction decreased greatly after a couple weeks.  Now the vacuum is totally broken, no suction and it's overheating.  Regretting this purchase, probably should have put the money towards a more expensive pet vacuum.  Apparently you get what you pay for....
Worst Vaccum Ever  This is the worst vacuum cleaner ever!! The materials other than the ball are cheap plastic and the ball so heavy it's very awkward to use. The hose for the attachments is so short the entire vacuum cleaner constantly falls. Plus the attachments are also cheaply made. I've had a Dyson before but this is the worst. The only thing good about it, is it does have good suction. I cringe every time I vacuum. Don't waste your money.
Check the model number!  Bait and switch?  Model #82700 is more expensive than model #82660.  As far as I can tell, the only difference is the length of the retractable cord.  The 82660 has a 15' cord (actually about 13 1/2 feet when fully extended) and the 82700 has a 20' cord.  I thought it was worth the extra expense to have the longer cord.  However, while I was charged for the 82700, I received the cheaper 82660.  They promptly sent me another, but it was also the wrong model.  So, I had two large boxes to re-pack and take to the post office.  I received an email from Amazon (1 month ago!) promising to resolve this issue.  I have not heard from them since.  At present, I don't have the vacuum cleaner and have not received a refund.  I agree with the other reviews. Except for the short cord, this seems to be a really good vacuum cleaner for the price (for hard floors, not carpet).  My low rating is due to the really poor service I've received.  I presume that this 'bait and switch' tactic is not condoned by Amazon, but they have done nothing to follow-up and resolve the issue.  So, if you purchase this item, be sure to check the label on the bottom to make certain you've received the correct model.  Even if the shorter cord is not a problem for you, you should get a refund for the price difference.
Only So-So  May be okay for smaller pets, but my Siberian Husky mix leaves memories of himself all over my couch and carpets. The product is poorly designed for larger jobs. The hose is too short to use effectively on upholstery. I have to lift the Vacuum and place it on the chair or couch to use the upholstery tool.  The bag-less cup is so small that even for the smallest jobs it has to be emptied over and over again. Doing so is not easy, and the design requires placing my hand inside the to pull out the hair and other debris. It is virtually impossible to empty without getting some of the muck on myself or on my floor.  It needs better design.
I'm very disappointed with this purchase  It's not worth the money. I'm very disappointed with this purchase! I waited too long and now I'm stuck with it!
Junk doesn't last  You pay for what you get.  If you plan on using this more than once a month look somewhere else
Worst Vacuum  Purchased this vacuum after reading many positive reviews. I had a Panasonic which worked great for over ten years. This vacuum lasted two months (used it twice weekly on three low area carpets) and the motor would shut off after vacuuming for ten minutes. Suffered another 9 months with this vacuum by shutting it off and letting it cool down every few minutes. Then the plastic hose broke and I gave up. I just purchased an Oreck.
Wish I could give ZERO STARS  This vac was impressive out of the box. the suction was amazing... for a week. You quickly will discover that his vac takes an enormous amount of TLC. If you have a woman in the house with longish hair, or pets, it will clog up immediately.  You have to use your fingers or a tool to pull out the debris EVERY time you vacuum. The filter pad has direct contact with debris, so it need to be replaced or washed every few vacuums.  WE VACUUM EVERY DAY.. not carpet.. hard wood floors.. and this vac lasted a month before it completely died, despite all our extra care of unclogging, etc. I'm not sure what it is supposed to vacuum up. It can't handle hair.. it chokes on anything bigger than a cheerio. Miserable, awful product.  Went into the garbage today. I suspect it has probably already been discontinued. PLEASE don't waste your money.
Poor customer service  rk
Great vacuuming, very poor wast contaner and attachments  I have to admit this vacuum does a good job of picking up dirt and a great job of pulling up dog hair.  The problem is that the container is sooooo small.  You are constantly dumping it.  If you have new carpets or rugs forget about this vacuum.  You will fill it in one pass over a new 5'  by 8' carpet with carpet fibers.  Then be ready to break out a pulled apart clothes hanger to fish everything out of the container when you try to dump it.  The container is only 1 1/2" inches wide around the canister at best.  Anything other than dust wedges itself in so it doesn't dump out.  It is a disaster try to dump.  Maybe this would even be tolerable if you didn't have to dump so often.  I give it three stars only because it does do a good job of vacuuming.  The attachments and hoses are also very cheaply made.  Using the hose and  attachments is also cumbersome.  The hose is thin, is always pulling back on itself so you are constantly pulling to keep the hose extended.  Spend more money and buy a Kirby.  It vacuums just as well and all the attachments are well build and easy to use.  It does use a bag, so that is continued expense but much cleaner in the end.  You pull the bag(after weeks if not months of use) and  throw it out.  There is not all the dust going everywhere the 4 or 5 times you have to dump the Dyson container during one vacuuming job.  Just don't buy the Kirby for the price the salesman hits you with at first.  They will come down by more than half if you are truly willing to let them walk out of you house without a sale.
Maybe it would be better on carpets  This vacuum disnt make any sense for us. We returned it. We have cats and maily hardwood floors. This vacuum's air vent is located directly on the front... Whenever we would try to clean up any dust or hair on the floor, it would get blown out of the way. The design makes no sense. Maybe it would be better on carpets.
it's in the garbage. Where it belongs  Hose is too short, wand is too short, cord is too short, hose winder works only part way, AND the hose pulls out of the canister. After two years of infrequent and frustrating use, it's in the garbage. Where it belongs.
JUNK!  Complete Garbage. This thing lasted about 6 months before it broke. Previously, I had a vaccum cleaner that lasted for what seemed like a decade. THIS, is junk!
Dont waste your money!!!!!  Only worked for a year!!!!!!!  Cuts off after 30 mins of use but now the hand held is not working at all!!!!!!!
Very disappointed in this vacuum  Very disappointed in this vacuum.  The hose is so cumbersome that it is difficult to even position the brushes where you want them to do the dusting etc.  I contacted the Eureka company, which of course, I didn't get any results and really didn't expect any.  I would definitely not recommend this Eureka Canister Vacuum. Wish I would have returned it but it's probably too late now.
Worst.  Vacuum. Ever.  I did quite a bit of research before I bought this vacuum.  I wanted something as powerful as my Eureka that I've had for 10 years, but a little lighter and easier to transition to hard wood.  When I first received this, I was disappointed that the power and suction wasn't comparable to by Eureka even with the same power.  Additionally, the hose is not very long and makes it hard to use the tools.  After 4 months, the vacuum is pretty much unusable.  It turns itself off after about 5 minutes of use and won't start again for 45 minutes.  And yes I've made sure to empty the canister, etc.  DO NOT BUY!!!!!
If you have a long haired dog do not get this machine. It has to be unclogged regularly. I have had it since February. One had to get a new head and then had to take it apart to clean the hose. Company does not back it in terms of getting a refund. I just can't crawl around on the floor "fixing" it.
Underpowered, overpriced, poor build quality  This vacuum is intended to be a clone of various 1980s-era Electrolux canisters. By looks and design, it is fairly close - it even takes the same bags. However, the build quality is nowhere near the same. An 80s Electrolux is probably still running today. In 30 years, this won't be. It is not worth the asking price. For $200, it might be worth considering.  However - even at that price point, it would only be mediocre. While it manages over 70 inches of water lift, its airflow is poor - managing only a 1.5 on a Baird meter at the end of the hose. The power nozzle is also substandard.  My recommendation - skip this. If you want a vacuum that will last for $900, get a Simplicity, Riccar, Miele or Sebo. For less money, you might look at either the Metropolitan canister, or the Panasonic MC-CG917 or MC-CG902. Any of these are far better than the (im)Perfect.
Poor design  It was very inexpensive, so I suppose I shouldn't complain, but it's a very poorly designed vacuum cleaner. The cord comes out the bottom and there's no way to raise it, so it's constantly getting in the way. I either trip on it, or it turns the power off because it's right near the power pedal. The suction is okay, but I wouldn't recommend it.
Hoover floor scrubbet  Thought it would have more scrubbing power. Thought it was the double tank. Have to fill water constantly not what I expectrf
Miele over-rated  Since I received my Miele vacuum, it has not worked properly. Husband threw away box, so I was advised by Miele customer service to take it to a local repair shop; the repair person did not help the machine at all. It is still blowing dirt from somewhere, rather than getting it off floor.  Thought  I would be all set with some "elite" vacuuming from this yellow monster.  Wish I had never heard of  Miele!
not that satisfied.. Just does not have as much power as i had hoped it would ..
buy the animal  I love Dyson and the "Animal" would get 20 stars from me.  Despite flimsy plastic construction (you'd be shocked) the performance is awe inspiring.  This twist on what I consider perfection was tempting so I bought it for my elderly mother- convincing her to retire her ancient Kirby (which had given hernias to all who dared use it).  What a disappointment.  Yes, the performance was incredible.  Dyson knows his stuff.  But the ball made this very hard to maneuver; I mean VERY HARD. It's like pushing a 30 pound wet noodle.  It's LIMP!  Who tested this thing???  Also the cheap plastic.......my 80 year old/80 pound mother broke it the second time she used it.  A piece didn't even break (which happened the first week of using my Animal), it actually came apart!  The handle release is a weird foot pedal kind of thing and it somehow separated itself from the unit.  A little plastic tab was holding it in a grove.  Getting it back in was a nightmare as there was no way to unscrew any surrounding parts and I had to pry (a little plastic tab) back into place.  A MAJOR component depends on a 1/4" plastic tab!!!  (Machine won't work without the handle release in a specified position.)  Yes, Dysons are worth the hype.....just not this one.
Sucks in that it doesn't.  Suction stopped after a month or two of no unusual use.  Followed everything in the manual to no avail.  On hold with Hoover for resolution.
Not what I expected  I bought the vacuum because I was looking for something small and something that would also do hardwood floors. I read most of the reviews and it sounded like a good little vacuum. It was easy to assemble. And the pick-up power was okay, however, the beater bar on the vacuum and the attachment kept sticking. You have to stop and switch the dial between "hose" and "floor" to use the attachments. And cleaning out the filter was messy and difficult. I have a bigger Eureka vacuum that I love, but it doesn't do hardwood floors. This is probably a good choice for someone who doesn't have a lot of space (apartment or condo, maybe).
Beautiful, With Fatal Design Flaw  This Electrolux is beautiful, ergonomic and performed nicely when it was new, but very soon, the problems began.  During light and normal usage within the first few weeks, the beater bar stopped turning and I took it apart to check it out.  What I found was a felt gasket which allowed hair and dirt to easily get past, destroying the bearing on the end of the beater bar.  After Electrolux scolded me about cleaning the beater bar, they reluctantly sent me a new part under warranty.  Although I kept the vacuum relatively clean over the next few months, the same problem occurred once again and the felt and rubber seals around the bearing disintegrated leaving the second bearing locked up solid. Vaccuum cleaners are meant to clean up hair and dirt, but this design is incapable of doing that for more than a few months before a predictable catastophic failure.
This cleaner is great....when it works!  This is the second Hoover SteamVac that we have owned. The first one was good, but the water reservoir kept leaking. While shopping around for a new one a few years ago, I struggled with what to get considering the lack of options out there at the time. We bought this model and while it's proven to be a good cleaner, it's made me a familiar face in the warranty dept. from having to get it served often. We learned from the previous model to purchase the extended 5 yr. warranty (we bought ours at BestBuy). To be honest, it was the best decision we made regarding the machine as I have to take it back to the Geek Squad for servicing the brushes or the leaky water reservoir about every 4 or 5 uses! Before I get flamed, let me first state that I thoroughly drain, rinse and air dry the soap/water reservoir every time after use. I also clean the brushes after every use as we have an Australian Shepherd and a German Shorthair Pointer in the house. I vacuum the carpets immediately before cleaning to grab excess hair and dirt out of the carpet fibers as best as I can. The most consistant issue is the stem that allows the brushes to spin breaks off. It is a small plastic rod that spins the brushes and it has proven to be a big design flaw. I've only had two issues with this machine regarding leaking. One was from a brittle stopper where the soap is dispensed. The other was a faulty rubber gasket. Like I said earlier, it's a great machine...when it works!
Don't Buy this Defective Product!  I hate giving this product a "one" because it is a terrible piece of equipment!  The first one delivered didn't work because the beater bar wouldn;t rotate.  The replacement failed in less than a year: again the beater bar was defective.  I went online to order a replacement beater bar and was informed it would have to be back ordered (long waiting list).  After a month I called to ask where I stood on the list and they said it would be another 3 months before I could expect a replacement. They wouldn't offer any special compensation for a replacement vacuum cleaner. With such a long waiting list for this part, it's obvious there are defective engineering and/or poor quality control issues with Hoover products.  I would warn all customers considering buying a vacuum cleaner to avoid Hoover products!
A great vaccume for hair long hair  Wow! A great vaccume for hair long hair!  We bought this vaccume it will save us from cleaning brush heads from hair. Which it is amazing at cleaning carpet and long hair. IT IS HORRIBLE ON HAIR WOOD FLOORS, it CANT EVEN PICK UP CRUMBS, or dust or dirt. So its great if you don't want to clean your vaccume all the time. Its horrible if you don't have wall to wall carpet everywhere in your house. Definately a one purpose vac.
Spend more money on a better one.  Over heating and handle is cheap.
Unbearable squeal!  Vacuum has a very loud high pitch squeal that makes your eardrums ache, even with earplugs and sound reducing headphones that play music.  The vacuum does a good job, but the sound irritation is unbearable.  I need to contact the manufacturer and see if they can replace the unit.  No problem with the seller, delivery was quick.
user unfriendly  user unfriendly!  very heavy.  when using the hose, the whole vacuum falls over when you pull the hose a little too hard (especially if on carpet).  dangerous if you're not aware and paying attention since the vacuum is usually behind you when using the hose.
bad quality of the vacuum head  I purchased DC25 two years ago (not refurbished machine).  Now the spin that the part is hooked with the brush does not move. I was told I have to replace the head of the vacuum, which is not covered by warranty, unfortunately.  I am not sure whether it is just bad luck, or a common problem.  BTW, the warranty looks so fake to me.
This was a great vacuum for almost a year  This was a great vacuum for almost a year, and really the small defect that I'm dealing with shouldn't be a big problem, but I'm giving this one star because of Dyson's TERRIBLE customer service.  As I mentioned, I have had this vacuum for a little under a year. Recently the latch button on the cyclone assembly has gone missing, I assume it popped out while somebody was emptying the bin and fell in the trash unnoticed. At any rate, the button is no longer there, and so the assembly can no longer be attached to the body. I figured this should be no problem to replace, after all I do have a 5 year warranty. I called up, and the representative told me that this is "not considered a manufacturer defect" because "with the type of plastic we use that could never happen by itself" and that in order to replace the button I would have to buy a whole new cyclone assembly for over $90. Never mind the fact that the button that went missing is contained within a plastic handle that is easily detachable from the cyclone assembly.  NO THANKS!  The 5 year warranty is a sham. don't believe the hype.
It stinks  It broke after 3 times using it. my choice is to mail it to Rochester NH. I get to pay freight both ways.  After paying freight I suppose it will cost as much as the $ 84 floormate did. It is 5 months old. I am pissed and it stinks.
Garbage  this machine never performed well and now the motor has died two weeks after the guarantee expired.  Am tossing in the garbage; Hoover products are consistently awful and we have joined Hoover anonymous to avoid future purchases.
close to horrible  i thought i was getting the best vacuum money could buy....WRONG  1.  it is very heavy 2.  when you go into tight spaces and the handle is more than about 75% upright, the rollers stop turning 3.  the attachments come in a bag, but you cannot keep your most used\fav one on the actual vacuum cleaner and if you take off the default attachment the vacuum will not run 4.  the cleaner is very immobile so if you use the crevice tool to say do baseboards its really VERY hard to lug the vacuum around the room with you 5. when you turn it on it automatically defaults on to carpet mode 6. it vacuums no better than a $100-200 vacuum 7.  one of the very few lg products (and i have quite a few in my house) that you cannot buy an extended warranty for 8. just between point 1 and 2 and 6 this vacuum isn't worth 20c  this purchase was such a bad one that i went and bought a miele which i used for the first time today and I really liked it.  i have 4 great danes...there is a lot to vacuum lol  anyway, if you are reading this review, do yourself a favour and buy something else
Works more like an electric broom  I've posted the stock image from the Hoover site - it's what the vacuum actually looks like. The one posted here is distorted. I've checked the model number listed here and the model number on the bottom of my vacuum; they are the same. I've had this model for about 6 months and use it 2-3 times a week.  I can't say I've owned a ton of vacuums. I try to get something with good reviews, around the $150 price range and hope it lasts several years. So far this vacuum has been the worst of the 5 that I've owned. Granted the older ones were from the early 90's and made of metal and not plastic. I've owned everything from this model to a Dyson red model from Target. This was $60 from Walmart, the Dyson was $300 (and still works great).  This works nothing like a typical 12 amp vacuum. The amps aren't listed on the box so you can't compare this at the store with other models. The stock image above first of all is stretched or the perspective altered, compared to what the vacuum actually looks like - the base is just over 11.5" wide at the front wheel base, a little narrower at the rear. The stock image here makes it look much wider than it appears in person, so don't be fooled. It does not have that "full-size" look in person. Vacuum amps are *not* listed on the Hoover website for this model.  There is a sticker on the vacuum which does not appear in the stock image, and it reads, "Lightweight Full Size cyclonic CLEANING POWER!" (all punctuation and capitalization is theirs). I don't know what full-size is supposed to reference exactly, but it does not have the cleaning ability of typical full-size vacuums.  If you want to use the attachments, you must remove the entire handle from the upper body, unclip the hose at the base of the body, clip the hose onto the upper handle, then put the the attachments onto the lower part of the handle. Suction power is only fair, nothing great (our main vacuum is a base model Eureka Airspeed Zuum, $100 from Target, and it works much better).  It is very lightweight. It does a fair job on low carpets and we have 2 short-hair cats and does a fair job picking up the hair but I have to go over an area a few times to get it clean. If you've got a small place, no pets, and your place is generally pretty clean in the first place, I can see that this *might* be a nice electric broom/light-duty vacuum to have around, but I've used a couple of Shark electric brooms that work better than this on hardwoods.  Go to the Hoover site for more customer feedback. Most reviews there are negative. [...]  UPDATE 5/13/2014 Suction power is ridiculously low. It was fair at best when new. I was using it less than once a week, and now it's outside and headed for the trash. I've checked it for clogs and there's nothing blocking airflow. I just received a Bissell today from Amazon for $75&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/BISSELL-CleanView-Upright-Vacuum-with-OnePass-9595/dp/B00AZBIZTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">BISSELL CleanView Upright Vacuum with OnePass, 9595</a>&nbsp;and it is AMAZING! Suction power is ridiculously better.
Buyer Beware!!!  This vacuum cleaner was a great buy, so I thought until yesterday! It picks up everything, and I do mean everything. The tools that come with it our great, and they do the job right. Problem is, I only had this vacuum 4 months, and yesteday while I was vacuuming, the motor burnt up on it. Now when I try to turn it on, it does nothing. I usually have great success with Bissell, not this time. Very dissapointing :(
Eureka 4870MZ Boss Smart-Vac Upright HEPA Vacuum Cleaner  In the beinginng I would have given this 5 stars for about 3  months.  I had to give 2 stars because in the beginning it worked good. Three months later our foot pedal release stopped working, the belt kept braking and finally the suction stopped working after 5-6 months so we are going to trash it:(  Glad to hear its working for some people...
Dust screen FLAWED!!!!  I bought the DC41 a couple of weeks ago and so far I'm not too happy with it. I got this vacuum because I have dogs and it sucks up the hair very good. But I find the DC41 to be very flimsy and awkward.  What I really hate is the screen that collects the find dust.  When I went to empty the hair, I noticed the screen had a lot of fine dust.  But guess what!  There is no way to get it out!  I guess I could get another vacuum and suck it out.  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!?!? This will drive me crazy! I'm seriously thinking about taking it back but the Dyson really does work better than any other vacuum.  So I guess i'm stuck with it.  Does anyone else have a problem with the fine dust just sitting in the vacuum?  I've had theDC07 for several years and really had no complaints.
It's NOT a vacuum. IT's for dusting...SO OVER RATED! Horribly expensive Dustbuster- This is a joke! I'm shocked how bad it is.  It's NOT a Vacuum cleaner... it's for dusting. It falls over, you can't vacuum an entire room without having to empty it 3-4 times per room! There is NO space for the dirt. MAYBE a cup of dirt. It's shocking they released this to the public as a vacuum.. It's NOT a vacuum. It's so annoying! The cord is SO short. It can't get to the other side of the room. You have to unplug it and find another outlet. I can't even get down the stairs without having to find another outlet.  The cord doesn't retract unless you put it on a flat service. It falls over constantly because it's too top heavy for the little wheels. IF you already have a vacuum cleaner and you want one for dusting that costs $350 dollars- go for it.  My sweet husband bought this for me for Christmas  for our first Christmas-and it was not the one I wanted but I couldn't tell him. Now I'm stuck with this inefficient , overpriced Dustbuster that I have to empty 3 times, remove the plug and find another outlet and  keep standing it up because it falls over constantly. I can't believe no one else is having these issues. It makes me not believe the other reviews. Seriously.
Beware of cheap materials  The price and description are very attractive, but unfortunately the quality is not. I liked the ease of switching batteries, and all the on-board attachments, and the size, but I didn't like the general quality. After 5 months, a wheel fell off. The vacuum is not usable without this cheap part. Also, the motor is weak and it is almost useless on carpet. When I examined the wheel, the housing is plastic and there is nothing that secures the wheel to the body. It appears to insert into a hole in the plastic housing, but there's no screw or other way to tighten it; so with time it loosens or the surrounding plastic cracks and the wheel falls off. It is inevitable that the wheel will eventually break.
On the recommendation of my brother in law we purchased this vacuum. We returned this item. We both hated it. It left the majority of the dog hair on the rug. We might have received a defective one as it seemed the height adjustment on the head did not move up or down. I wanted so badly to like this because I didn't want my wife to be able to choose its replacement. I would give it 1 star but, when I see those, I tend to think the reviewer is being extreme. Avoid this vacuum.
Bought used unit, arrived inoperative.  packaging was less than amateur, no manual included, machine was clogged when received (which is probably why it was returned and sold as refurbished, however problem was not corrected, they simply wrapped it up and resold it.) Also required many phone calls to rectify problem.  however now it works great but it was a pain to get it right.  I love the vacuum it is not fault of vacuum that someone clogged it up with wood shavings.  It is the fault of the reseller for not correcting the problem before reselling again as used.
Junk  I owned the previous model of this vacuum, had it for several years, and loved it!  So when it was time to replace the old one, I went and bought this model, even though it looked different and felt like it was made of cheaper plastic.  After using this vacuum 5 times, the belt broke.  I replaced the belt with the Bissel recommended belt, used it again, and it broke after 2 times of using it.  I got my boyfriend to replace the belt for a second time and still had the same issue, so I took the vacuum back and bought another one - exactly like the one I had and still had the same problem with belt breaking.  In this case, you get what you pay for.  Actually, I didn't even get what I paid for, considering I couldn't even get the thing to stay working!
Electrolux Warranty Worth Nothing!  Bought as gift for Christmas 2014.  Unit ONLY 2+ mos. old.  No handle to pick up unit -- only slot to put finger tips in which is not deep enough to grasp.  Unit had problem with powermate shutting off after a min. of use.  Went online and saw where numerous people had same problem and chalked it up to touching the buttons on the handle by mistake.  Unfortunately, went past my 30 days to return to Amazon thinking this was the problem and it's not.  Tried to take it to a repair center for warranty work and they want $29.95 to look at -- cost me $400 to buy and now they want $29.95!  Really disappointed at Amazon.  I thought it would be unfair to send it back back to Amazon without trying to get fixed under warranty and now I'm stuck with a $400 piece of .....!  SHAME ON YOU AMAZON FOR NOT STANDING BEHIND WHAT YOU SELL -- you should refuse to sell their products instead of the "old well" attitude you gave me.
Pathetic Communist Constructed Crap  The power head quit working in less than ten minutes of use.  I unsnapped the wand at the top to get a cobweb, when I snapped it back on the power head had no power.  I bought this because my old Kenmore canister power head motor burned out when a yarn was pulled out of a rug.  We couldn't get a new motor for it, so I bought this because the new Kenmore reviews were so bad.  The new Kenmore has the same problem that this vacuum does with the extension wand.  This is definitely NOT the Electrolux quality of my childhood.  I'm returning it and going back to square one.  I wish I could afford a Riccar instead of communist constructed crap.
Eureka 3670G Mighty Mite not so mighty !  Really disappointed in this vacuum . hard to push back and forth on carpet and doesn't pickup pet hair very well .
Don't buy this!  I have never written a review good or bad for a product before but I have had it with this piece of crap vacuum. Bought two dysons one for home one for office and they are in the repair shop at least twice a year. If all bagless vacuums are like this I will never buy one again. They don't turn on they don't pick up. The filters need to be cleaned all the time. Seems like a simple concept. You suck up the dirt into the canister and then you empty it out. So why is it so unpredictable?  Oh you have a leak in the hose (2times). Oh there are leaves caught. Now it won't even start up. So back to the repairman we go. Do yourself a favor and buy a different vacuum.
You get what you pay for (it not less)  The first time I used the vacuum I was impressed with how great it worked, but ever since the first use (no matter how much I clean the filters) I can't get it to work the same. It will randomly overheat and hardly picks up anything. Very disappointed as it got my hopes up after first use. Wouldn't purchase again.
A Pet Vacuum Only If Your Pet Is Bald  If I could give this negative stars it would be about a -3.  I purchased this because it's supposed to be for homes with pets.  It's for pets ONLY if you don't mind stopping every ten feet, turning it off, flipping it over, unhooking the intake hose, and unjamming the pet hair.  I will never purchase a Bissell product again.  The only reason I didn't return it is that due to some health issues, it was a few months after I purchased it before I actually started using it and the packaging had long since been thrown out.
Worked great - but only three times  Worked great - but only three times!  Second time I used it, the roller quit working.  The third time, it won't even stay on.  Hopefully, their customer service will replace it and it's just a lemon because I really like the features.
Cheap, breaks down, not worth it.  This vacuum is exactly what I paid for - garbage!!!  have owned it for less than 1 year (I bought it August 2014 right around moving time), and it worked great the first couple of months. I have cats, and long hair that I'm always shedding. I needed something to keep up with us hairy creatures, and this vacuum could not keep up after about 6 months, It's been sitting in my closet since February, it will no longer turn on. That's a little less life than I expected from my $50 purchase, but I am not surprised. In the long run, this is not worth it.
don't buy  Vacuum is made with cheap parts that break. One of the parts that broke was needed to clean the floors.  Even though the vacuum is under warranty this part was not.  Customer service is actually worse then the vacuum itself. I do not recommend this vacuum and will need to buy another brand.
Terribly designed  This is by far the worst vacuum you can purchase. Yes the suction power is amazing, but the vacuum itself is poorly designed. When you use the hose feature it becomes so unstable and is constantly falling on the floor, or on my foot, or has the potential to fall on my kids. I would not recommend this vacuum to any of my friends or family members. If I had the option to return it for the $180 I invested in it I would. From now on we will be sticking to Dyson only products!
Do Not purchase this cheap Chinese made electrolux  Vacuum itself is powerful and works.  The height adjustment on the head was always quirky and finally broke after 4 months.  We can't return it (which would be my preference) because it's over the return policy time period.  Calling Electrolux is not very helpful, and requires you, the customer, to take an Electrolux email stating warranty is allowed, with my proof of purchase to one of their authorized stores (only 15 miles away) to see if they can fix it.  Hopefully it won't cost anymore than my time and headache.  Very disappointed in Electrolux.  Electrolux vacuums have been used in my family for generations.  It's now March 2017, 7 months after this purchase.  We've been able to use this for only 2 months.  It went to a dealer for repair and came back with a "new" head that actually works worse.  It no longer is self-propelled and you have to push it with lots of force to move it on carpet.  This a such a cheap poorly made product.
Very Disappointed  Very disappointed in the quality of this vacuum. I really tried to embrace it and get used to the new design. I returned it yesterday. It vacuums great, how ever with Dyson wanting to make a lighter vaccum really made a poor design.  This design is light and spindly, It falls over so easily, ever time I would take my hand off of it. I fought with it every time I vacuumed. It doesn't feel like a solid vaccum. I wish I could replace my old Dyson that I loved so much and bought about 10 yrs ago. I wish I could have given Dyson a better review. Now I need to figure out what vacuum to buy.
European Plug  Not sure what the deal was but I received a blaster that did not have an American plug. Had to send it back so pretty sure someone else is going to get the same unit delivered to them.
Beware of Bissell!  I just purchased another model Bissell vacuum&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/BISSELL-67F8-Rewind-Premier-Pet-Black/dp/B0057QEJYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">BISSELL 67F8 Rewind Premier Pet, Black</a>&nbsp;to replace a smaller Bissell Pet Vac that is no longer being made. I noticed when I started vacuuming that the cord was getting very hot so I mentioned it to my husband who is an electrician. He checked the cord and found the information stamped on the cord that it was made with 17 gauge wire. He looked it up and found that 17 gauge wire is not to be used on anything higher than 2.9 amps. The vacuum is a 12 amp model. The wire inside the cord is only 1/4 the size it should be to handle 12 amps! It seems to me that a lot of previously good companies are going overboard trying to save money on their costs at the expense of the consumer. I don't plan on ever buying another Bissell product since it seems this is the way they are going. The model I ordered is made in China, if I would have noticed that before I ordered it I would have looked at another company to begin with.  I own a Bissell carpet shampooer and have owned Bissell vacuums in the past but I'm now afraid they are sacrificing quality and safety, this isn't the Bissell it used to be.
Great cordless feature but I'm already shopping for a new cordless vac.  This vac is great because you don't have to deal with a cord. However the build quality is not up to par. Cheap plastics are used, the motor is weak  and the beater brush  clog, freezes and breaks (pet and people hair) and it has been an on going problem(I'm on my 3rd at $20+ each ). If you want a replacement for your day-to-day vac, this isn't powerful enough to make you happy. The cordless feature was enough for me to buy this product, I just wish it had more power and was built better.
just died  I have a small place with wood floors. I thought this would be great but I didn't use it much but I wanted something to help with dust more than broom or dust mop. It started to smell like burnt rubber and then just died. Under a year so hopefully Bissell will cover warranty, Amazon is only 30 days. I must have a got a lemon because I got it because of the good reviews.
Died after 2 months!  Terrible suction and died after 2 months. Amazon return window closed so now I eat my $250. Do t buy it!
Amazon is selling used as new!!!  BUYER BEWARE!!!  We were sent a USED vacuum as brand new!  Everything looked legit util we started using it and there was no suction.  I no sooner clipped the ziptie to the retractable cord, turned it on, and the red flow indicator was on. Checked the filters and found the bottom one was dirty.  Then we pulled the hose and found a giant clog of stuff we didn't vacuum up!  I used it on bare floors for two minutes and the attached pic is what came out. Amazon, you have a quality control issue!!!!  We're sending this machine back, ASAP!
picks up a lot of dirt... that's about it  **edited at bottom**  for me it's more of a pain to use than anything.... it weighs a ton, the hose pops out all the time and if you don't notice it you have to go back over what you already did, the hand tool suction has never been strong even out of the box... the attachment that is supposed to rotate has never worked for us due to lack of proper suction from the hose.  The main section of the vacuum has great suction.. in fact we now have lumps throughout the house which after inspection are actually clumps of dirt under the carpet due to having a  dog for 10 years.  This thing will suck dirt up from China.  (can't figure out why the hose has terribly aweful suction.. I even inspected it for clogs, there are none.)  It's a good thing we're replacing the carpet soon.  The most annoying thing however is cleanup with this vacuum, which is basically every time you use it.  I tap the filter with a paint brush in the garage sink to clean it and then run the entire canister (not the paper filter) under hot water.  You have to do this every time and if you're picking up a lot due to animals you're cleaning it a few times per use.  So i wind up using 2 vacuums since this one can't get under things...  i'm still hooked to the old bag vacuum.  The only plus on this vacuum is the ease of not changing the bag.... which when you think about it is actually easier than cleaning and breathing in the dirt this thing picks up.  I wouldn't buy this type again, it's just too hard to deal with.  Aug. 4, 2007 a few months ago we took the vacuum in to be looked at.. it turns out there was a blown part in the motor.  After being replaced ($40) the hose now has suction and the vacuum brush will rotate when hooked to the hose.  I think i was a little harsh in my review.  It is a good vacuum... tons of suction as i said.  The main problem i have with it is the weight (i lift it to vacuum dog hair off beds), and the cleanup.  If you have pets you'll have to replace the main filter every 6 months max...  don't pay full price though, type in "hoover 40140201" and get a replacement filter for just under $15 right here on amazon.
I was very happy with this vacuum when I first got it but now 6  months later it has quit sucking up. very disappointed!  A vacuum should last more than 6 months and I only used it on average 2 times a week
Disappointed  I bought this vacuum just over a year ago. I have several cats and a lab who all shed. I didn't realize how poorly this vacuum was cleaning my carpet until I used another vacuum that cost under $50. I vacummed my living room twice with the Dyson. It wasn't picking up any more dust or fur so I thought I was done. My daughter's vacuum was right there, so I decided to try that one as well (what the heck, right?) I was shocked at what it picked up! After 12 more times of vacuuming the carpet, the cheap one was STILL picking up inbedded fur and dust. I was completely grossed out that this had been in my carpet. When I was done, my carpet looked like it had been shampooed and it had vacuum lines in it, which it never does with the Dyson. I would never buy one of these again. Don't wast your money.
doesn't suck up anything...not dog hair not crumbs  Worst vacuum ever.  Came highly recommended on review websites and it is really terrible at vacuuming. Don't buy!!  Our old Oreck vacuum does a way better job.
Now with lower quality!  Purchased this in December of 2014 to replace a much loved Dyson DC07 Animal. The DC07 was an incredible vacuum and built like a tank! So much so that we were sold on the Dyspn brand despite them being double the price of competitors. Upon receiving the latest and greatest new toy, disappointment almost instantly set in. Picking the cleaner up by the handle to remove it from the box brought an uncomfortable familiar feeling. It felt like the cheap Chinese made toys from the dollar store. The flimsy plastic flexed so much that we thought it would snap before it was out of the box. Needless to say, it didn't have the familiar build quality of the DC07.  Fast forward a year and a half and the handle has finally snapped. It snapped during normal use. The rear wheels retract during use and to engage them so the cleaner will stand up you must push the body of the sweeper forward. This is a crappy design and the wheels often refuse to stay locked to transport the unit. Now, I'm forced to purchase the complet upper duct work assembly so we can use it again.  In addition to this, the power button is finicky. It takes a magic touch to get the button to keep the sweeper on. Pushing it 6-7 times isn't unusual.  The only good thing I have to say is that it still sweeps reasonably well when it does work.  The short story is that Dyson has killed its reputation with this sweeper. I wouldn't hesitate purchasing a DC07 again, but these new cheaply made(but very expensive) vacuums are a rip off.
BAD product  It worked for 1 month.  Now I can't return it or get in touch with anyone at Hoover.  Won't buy another Hoover
JUNK!  JUNK! We have not had this vacuum very long and it already is having significant issues. I did SO much research before purchasing it and am so disappointed. It overheats, makes a crazy noise, doesnt suck that well, the cord rewind feature doesnt work that well, the handle falls off, its a pain in the butt to empty, and so on. I debated between all the big name vacuums, from Dyson on down, and after talking to someone who used to work for Hoover and reading the reviews on this one thought this would be our best option. BAD DECISION! I don't know what the right one is, but it isn't this one.
Pass, get a better vacuum.  We did a lot of research on a vacuum to purchase. LOTS OF RESEARCH and finally settled for this vacuum. It was nice for the first few weeks then all of a sudden, SNAP, wouldn't stand up on it's own anymore. When using the vacuum in the first place you literally had to almost stand on the front to get the suction part down to start vacuuming. We thought that was an odd feature but kept using it. Wouldn't recommend this vacuum at all. If you're in the marked for a good vacuum I'd recommend the Dyson Animal. We've had this one so far for over a year and couldn't be happier.
hate it  very cheezy,hose is to short .carpet attachment clogs and stops spinning.bag is too small . won't recommened this product !!!!!
I am Charlie Brown and Dirt Devil is Lucy holding the football....  Yes, I've been fooled by Dirt Devil before and I believe them and the reviews when their new line is gloriously touted.  Got 4 months out of this one before it stopped picking up dirt and began it's second career as a dust machine.  I'll continue to love Peanuts, but my relationship with Dirt Devil is concluded.  Hope others are having better luck.
Purchased vacuum only to find the two scews necessary to attach handle were missing. Of course you have to contact Hoover not Amazon. Spent 40 minutes on phone with Hoover trying to get two scews. Will take 7-10 days to arrive. So we have a new vacuum which we can't use for two weeks.
Disappointed  Has 2 belts; one of them is supposed to last a long time, but broke after little use.  Is not very smooth no matter what setting it is on (except maybe the floor setting). I do not have a lot of carpet in my home so I think the performance is bad for what little it needs to clean.
Great (if the animals you have are fish, lizards, or snakes)  We have 2 collies. They produce a LOT of fur. We have had two other Dyson Animals, and so bought this one when we finally burned out the other two. DON'T BUY THIS if you have any animals that shed fur. After less than two months of use, the beater bar gathered so much fur around the spindle that the plastic melted and gave off a burned smell. Now, every time I vacuum, I have to take the beater bar apart and clean out the hard, impacted fur to prevent this smell from occurring. I hate this vacuum so much, that I'm contemplating getting fish and selling the collies. Wait. Strike that - I'll get rid of this damn Dyson, instead.  The cord - shorter than our prior Animals.  The dust bin - less volume than our prior Animals.  The intake design from the beater bar into the neck of the machine gets clogged easily due to poor air-flow design when carrying fur.  I do like the design of the hose and also the suction of the motor (when not blocked by fur).
Even for the low price  The brush does not stop for bare floors so kicks out dirt. Also the brush against a bare floor creates a loud buzzing noise. Despite proper placement of tools they fall off as you vacuum. Very very cheap vacuum and seller has a terrible return policy for when you will want to return this item. Fortunately Amazon may make up for it. Does not work well on different rugs as well.  Don't let the cheap price deter you.  You'll throw away the money you could have spent on a better vacuum. Will never purchase from this Bissell, not sure they have quality control department.
2nd one wasn't a charm  1st one died after 3 weeks, but amazon exchanged it easily enough. Well fast forward 18 months after the second one and all IS NOT well. The cord stopped retracting after about 3 months and the power button fell off recently. Now I fully understand with wear and tear and I'd be remiss to say this vacuum wasn't used. It's a vacuum, it's gets its abuse sure, but I had a dirt devil for 7+ years with nearly no problems ( belt and bags replacement only ) and it's not like I threw it against a wall, it was carried and pulled just Ike it was designed ( except it's 3 wheels design is more often dragged then pulled ). This canister is no deal at all. It's just another disposable item after a year, so please don't expect it to last under normal use. I recently bought a Dyson and Im glad I finally got the sense to spend the extra money on quality.
No Suction, Loud, Falls Apart  This has barely any suction power and the little brush strands get clogged very easily because of there being no suction power. Also, it is very loud and the sections of the nozzle fall apart too easily. I bought this in hopes of it being a solution for quick pick ups between more thorough cleaningings on hardwood floor and tile. We have a dog and I hoped to run this once a day to get her hair up. It takes multiple slow passes to pick up the hair and in the process the brush gets clogged and the whole handle things falls apart. We have lived in this house for less than a week, so I wasn't trying to pick up any large messes and it couldnthandle it. I gave up both times I used it and only did about 200 square feet because it took about 10 minutes to do that, it wasn't  doing a good job and I couldn't handle the noise any longer than that. I think something like this will be a good solution, but this specific one is useless.
gave 5 months of good use, and THEN....  I fell in love with this vacuum the moment I started using it.  It was quiet, it maneuvered beautifully, and it picked virtually everything up. I felt uneasy buying such an expensive vacuum when my kenmore worked fine, but after using it, I thought, FINALLY, something for my money's worth. Well, 5 months later, the vacuum started losing suction and the power bar kept going to its lowest setting on its own.  I changed the dust bag, thinking it was full (even though the dust bag indicator hadn't turned on, being one of its features), but the same problem.  Then I thought it was the battery, so I opened the battery compartment, only to see that it was one of those tiny round batteries you'd have to buy especially for the vacuum.  Going back to the operating manual, I read that I only had to change the battery once every 18 months, so I tried to close the battery compartment back up.,..to no avail.  It just wouldn't close back properly!  My husband tried to push the compartment back in, but even he couldn't do it.  With a half-closed battery compartment, I called the Miele # on the manual. The closest local dealer is about an hour away, and it's not like they'd fix it on the spot.  I'd have to drop it off, then pick it up.  Packing the vacuum back up to ship it to the warranty center is going to take too long.  I'd be without a vacuum cleaner for God knows how long???!!!  I have 3 toddlers and 1 baby, and frankly, this is ridiculous.  I can't believe I paid so much money for only 5 months of use.
Don't belive the picture that Amazon.com on their site!!!  The attached pictures in their site has a hand vacumn attachment that is not part of the package.
doesn't work well  years ago i used one it worked very well.i was able to hold it or not. this one was very uncomforable to handle while using it.could not put it down without everything falling off.the tools.it did some pick up but not everything.i don't have time to play with a vaccum .
Painfully slow and ineffective.  If this put out more water to scrub the floors with, it'd be decent. Instead, I'm constantly holding down the handle trying to get more water on my tiles. It's painfully slow, and not very effective. The only nice thing is the dirty water it picks up. Still looking for a good machine.
This vacuum absolutely sucks. It's constantly getting clogged  This vacuum absolutely sucks. It's constantly getting clogged, it has to be on the bare floor setting to get the pet hair out of our carpet. Day one out of the box was even disappointing. We are a multi dog home, 2 great danes and 1 95 pound mix with very long hair. I like the tool that gets into small spaces, but that's if there is minimal dirt. I do like the rotating brush because I haven't had to clip hair out of that, but the rest is just straight disappointing. I purchased off of reviews, so I don't know if I just got a bad machine or what. I'm going to be purchasing another today.
It did not even last six months.  It did not even last six months before the motor burned out. It is a complete piece of garbage not worth purchasing.
Horrible  This horrible piece of junk failed in one month after I purchased it. Not only the it lost suction, It leaves behind a trail of dust balls Do not buy this .
not what I expected.  scars my painted garage floor and doesn't clean properly.  will probably return.
Dont buy  I thought this would be good since most the reviews were good. But this unit is awful. Weight was fine.  However the spinbrush does NOT clean your grout. I thought well maybe it would get the bird poop from our bird. It didn't even do that. So im hoping to return it.  Sprays the water picks up most the water which is dirty. But having dirty water in the return unit iant impressing me. After all thats why im cleaning the floor smh
Died on first use  Motor died on first use.
Way to heavy, many steps to make it work
Perfect Canister Vacuum Cleaner  Perfect Canister Vacuum Cleaner purchased thru Amazon.com in Oct. 2011.  While it had great suction, too many things went bad on it.  August 2012 the cord rewind quit working.  In September 2012 the cheap plastic that held the bag door broke.  The blower door has never stayed closed.  Now in August 2013 vacuum now will not turn on.  Very dissapointed as last electrolux lasted 19 years.  I have lost confidence in Electrolux.
Dangerous Vacuum  I used this vacuum to clean up after 4 dogs. The first time I used it I thought WOW this thing is great. I just finished using it for the second time and it will be going back to the store. It worked great on my carpet but when I used it on my hardwood floors it started throwing the dirt back out. It took several attempts at getting all the dirt vaccumed up. I could have cleaned the floor quicker with a broom. Then I made the biggest mistake of all. I ran over the cord. Sparks starting flying everywhere and the breakers in my house were thrown. The roller brush is so powerful that it ate up the cord. I have run over cords before and nothing like this has ever happened. I would not give one of these vacuums to my worst enemy
Worst vacuum ever!  I bought this 6 months ago and it's completely broken.  From the start, this vacuum proved to be inferior to even the cheapest Bissell vacuum I had before.  The suction was poor and it would shred little pieces of paper rather than vacuuming it up.  I can't believe they charge $140 for this piece of useless thing.  Definitely save your money and either buy a Bissell or go upscale and buy a Dyson.  Hope this helps you.  I'm off to shop for my replacement now...
Almost no suction  It doesn't have a good suction making it almost useless in hardwood floor
The Devil made me buy it!!  We have had this vacuum about a year. Actually my grandmother has. Sure it picks up dirt, dust and pet hair, but there are many faults. First, every couple uses, I go to empty the bin and the lid comes off and the handle is on the lid so the bin falls to the floor and dirt spills all over. Second, the hose is short and the dust brush is very very very hard to get to stay on or take off its hook. And in the dirt bin there is a filter and it sits in the dirt so it loses suction. The vacuum picks up the dirt on area rugs but also picks up the rug. Changing the belt is one of the most hard things to do. I actually ended up cutting myself doing it. And it took 3 people to do it in the end. One other thing I hate about it is that the auto carpet height adjustion dosent work wery well and will make the vacuum very hard to push on low traffic areas like arround the base bords where no one walks. Also it has a hepa type filter that has to be changed every three monthes, but is only $7.00 for two. But the vacuum is not that loud and does pick up dirt and hair, and is lightweight and not to expensive but is is isen't worth the money even at 79.99. Thanks for reading. Update: Lately after about 5 minutes of vacuuming the belt starts to smell like it is burning. I changed the belt and a couple of weeks laterthe belt was streched to almost twice th origional size. We only vacuum once a week and so this is like after 2-3 uses. Today, I had to stop a couple times beecause A: I couldent stand the smell of the belt burning, B; I was worried that it might not be the belt and it might be the motor and not wanting to start a fire, I had to stop, and 3:even on an empty canaster with a extreamly clean filter, I had almost no suction. After the whole house which has two pets I had almost no dust and very little pet hair. I found that the Fantom Twisters work as good as the origionals and out preform this piece of trash wonderfully!!!!!! I wish this mechine would brake so that I could get my grandmother to buy a new vacuum!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Not Quality  This machine did not meet my expectations.  My entire family always believed Electrlux was one of the best cleaners available, based on our history.  This machine is awkward to use at times, as depressing the button with your foot to relax the handle to begin vacuuming results in the beater nozzle going up in the air and the handle not being released easily.  Also I have hardwood floors throughout my house with area rugs in several rooms.  I needed a floor duster brush to use on the hardwoods.  The floor duster, which was not originally in my package (I had to call Electrolux twice to get it), is a joke.  There is no " brush" at all, but rather one strip of what looks like felt on it with noisy plastic rollers that rub across the floor as you are vacuuming.  the rollers are harsh on the floor and not what most people would consider a brush that serves to protect the hardwood.  What happened to the beautiful double brush floor duster attachment of years gone by?  Those were wonderful and held up well through the years.  After this experience with Electrolux, when shopping for a new dryer this week, I walked right past the ones with the Electrolux logo on them.  Business lost from this customer due to cheapened product line!
Horrible Vacuum...  this vacuum cleaner is not a good vacuum. I meat it. I will never buy it again.
Absolutely Awful, Do Not Purchase  This vacuum is by far the absolute worst vacuum I have ever used - and I have used some CHEAP vacuums. This vacuum literally just pushes dirt/debris around - it does a much less than mediocre job of vacuuming on carpet, you have to go over the same spot numerous times just to get it 80% clean, and forget about using it on any hard surface.  It absolutely refuses to pick up anything on a flat surface.  I am not one that typically writes reviews, but I have never been more disappointed with a purchase and hope to prevent someone else from feeling the same disappointment.
recall(?)  this vacuum has a recall on it if you call bissell personally. I do not know the exact years for the recall. Bissel was very helpful to me in getting it replaced for free.
do not waste your money  Constantly over heats, do not waste your money.
Will not Latch  I cannot really rate performance, because I have not gotten that far. The hood will not stay latched, so we have not even attempted to use it. I guess I get to try Panasonic service - wish me luck.
Junk  Stopped working after 2 months
Gets hot very fast that I need to turn it off every now and then.
Bad vacuum. Wasted my money!  i bought this vacuum when out at Lowes and needed one that day. Loved it at first--good suction and better than my other vacuums I have had in the past. HATE IT NOW.It stopped sucking dirt and now just spits it back out onto the floor. The worst part is the fact that it is constantly getting clogged near the top where the dirt first comes in, so you have to constantly take it apart to empty it if you want to clean your house. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!
it sucks  the dirt devil sucks! I mean it doesn;t suck dust... I hate it!
Would not recomend  Carpet hight adjustment does not work right out of the box.  Power cord exits to low so you always have to reach way down to get it.  Power switch in on the mid level front of the machine and not on the handle.  Hose is such that you have to always reverse the couplings in order to use it easily. As usual with many brands it comes as a pile of parts.  It does have good suction but, that is about all.  A total waste of $150 and going back to a Hoover again.
Warning.  Do not let this thing into your house  We bought this POS over a year ago.  We have all tile floors, and the machine will clog over the smallest pieces of junk laying on the floor.  A 1/4 inch piece of paper or wood will force you to take this stupid thing apart, find the offending debris, & put the monstrosity back together.  Unless your floor only has dust, don't bother to purchase this POS!
Died after a year even with regular maintenance. It will do a pretty good job getting cat hair off stuff during that year though
Do not buy this product!!!!!!!  This vacuum has great suction and is extremely light weight. Get ready to replace the drive belt every four months. I complained to the company and they advised this is normal .  If they could fix this problem it would be a great vacuum.
real crap  Real crap, save your money
Disappointed!  I was really excited to get this product as I had been using a vacuum for hardwood floors and then old school bucket with braided mop. I was tired of how long it took to do both. My whole house is hard wood floors. We have one dog and one cat. I am going back to the old way. I am not impressed with the amount of solution that comes out for mopping, it's barely anything! No matter how long you hold the button down! I don't think it works as well as the old mop does. And cleaning out the bin that has animal hair and dirt?! Gross.. if I didn't have animals and old dealt with the dirty water it wouldn't be so bad, but man... the amount of hair and dirt plus water is bad and the last thing I'm going to do is pour it down my sink or go outside with a hose. I don't have to deal with any of that the old way. The only reason I gave it two stars was because now I only use it for my area rugs as a vacuum... the hardwood vacuum I use before I mop is an old super light Boswell that I use everywhere really, but it doesn't work good on rugs. The crosswave does work good on area rugs to get all the embedded dog hair up, tho I don't use any solution so I don't have the wet hairy mess to clean up after. My old janitor braided mop works amazing and floors are way cleaner longer than this product!
Terrible customer service  We have 3 dogs and 3 cats and were excited to get this vacuum based on the reviews. It might be ok on carpets, but on bare floors it does not do a good job. The fur gets lodged in the brush and have to clean it quite often. However my biggest gripe is with their customer service. We had the vacuum less than two months and the metal clip that comes through the hole in the bare floor attachment fell out - we could not find it. I asked LG for the part number - first the part number they gave me was wrong then I found out that you cannot buy that clip by itself. The clip is about $4.50 but I have to buy the whole pipe assembly (item 1019 on their diagram) which sells for $20 to $60 without shipping. I just decided to put in a dowel pin into the whole - I can by a a ShopVac for the cost of this part and will do a better job on bare floors.
My home has a lot of tile floors to clean.  It took extremely long to clean and did not dry as I expected.  I also found it hard to turn off and on.
Noisy, Messy, Inefficient Piece of Junk  There is absolutely NOTHING good to say about this model. I have owned two other dirt devil vac's in the past and liked them both but not this one.  1. It has a hideous high pitched whine while running. It's so bad it made my ears ring and I had to resort to wearing ear protection while using. I'm not sure if they are all like this or if I just got "lucky". Whether the bagless  container was full or empty made no difference in the noise level.  2. The bagless feature is a JOKE. Words cannot describe how STUPIDLY it was put together. It's so convoluted and has so many parts that it's extremely hard to empty. The pet hair gets gobbed up inside it and you have to get some kind of long handled tool to try to scrape it out and to add insult to injury, it's horribly MESSY when emptying. Make sure you put some newspaper down around your garbage can or you'll end up having to Swiffer your kitchen floor after you empty this piece of junk. In fact, I recommend you take it outside and empty into something there.  3. As if the first two things weren't enough, it doesn't suck very well either. You have to go over and over and over carpet and upholstery to get it to pick up pet hair and even then, pet hair is still visible. My previous vacuum (a Hoover) did a much better job and cost less.  Wish my hubs would have checked the reviews here prior to buying. The negative reviews are all true. I wish we could get our money back.
DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM!!!  READ ME FIRST  The suction on this is SO SEVERE and powerful, even the HIGHEST CARPET SETTING, sucks the vacuum to SEAL and not move.. one centimeter, on my hard wood floors.  It simply seals.  I have tried all of the settings (low/hardwood/high carpet etc) and they all do the same thing.  It is the ultimate in cheap PLASTIC... all of it.  Waste of money, I am returning to Amazon.com.  I so wanted to love this.  ONE MORE THING... FORGET the HEPA filter on here... the SEAL IS EXTERNAL and PLASTIC...so dust can leak back into your air.  RETURNING FOR SURE!!!  Pure junk.
It was recommended by a friend  I bought this vacuum a few years back. It was recommended by a friend. I own one cat and I have to say I'm not that please overall because trying to clean up something simple like litter it will suck it but spits out behind. I have mostly hardwood floors in my home and I'll go back through a room that I just cleaned and still see stuff on the floors. Not super happy and shopping for a new one.
OK vacuum and VERY VERY VERY HEAVY...
especially things like cat hair on carpets  the turning brushes on the floor attachment get stuck often with dirt or derbis and won't turn, even when clean do not turn well. this vacuum does not pick up well, especially things like cat hair on carpets.  We are sorry we purchased it.
Totally Disappointed  After reading all of the reviews, I have decided that I must have a defective vacuum. I certainly don't have the wonder machine people are describing.  I have had this vacuum for 2 months.  I vacuum every day because  I have a Golden Retriever who loses a lot of hair.  So far, I haven't had the need to empty the canister at all -- simply because NOTHING is sucked up.  On bare floors, crumbs "spit" out the back.  If it weren't for a refurbished Dyson I am using, the house would be a disaster.  I am greatly disappointed.
broke in 1 week  Absolute garbage. We bought this mostly based on good reviews. Worked good for about a week than the height adjuster broke. Plastic junk. Avoid this product.

I have cleaned houses for over 25 years and I am a little obsessed with vacuum cleaners. Ive used Dyson (which I believe are over priced and overrated), Hoover which are ok depending on the model, and I own 2 sharks which I LOVE!! The reason I choose to buy a bissell pet hair eraser is to eliminate the need to clean the brush all the time. While it does not collect any hair, string, rug pieces on the brush, the suction is far less than the shark. Every time you move from carpet to hard floor, you must switch the dial on the side- thats annoying! The wand has no power and is very narrow. And all pics I viewed showed people cleaning stairs and up high on curtains, etc.  totally misleading!(picture shown below) If you want to clean -suck up anything more than 3 feet away, your picking up the machine. I have a lot of hardwood and tile in my house- this is not the sweeper for you! You have to make sure its set on floor and the setting is all the way down or you are throwing it all over and sometimes it does this even on lowest setting. The one picture I have with the leaf- I had on correct settings for tile, 2 minutes later I went to sweep the rug under my table and this is what fell from the bottom of the sweeper. The picture shows a clean drop after sweeping- I have to literally put my hand into the tank and pull dirt out- yuk!! And this day, I couldn't get some pieces out and there is not way to get all the dirt out of the small sections unless you rinse with water. Very disappointed !!!
belt broke after 1 week  I purchased this product to replace an Infinity brand vacuum I've had for 3 years.  My former vacuum was heavy and the extension wand was broken.  I was hoping for a lightweight, cost effective model to use on wood floor, tile, and carpeting with the ability to pick-up pet hair from one dog. The Bissell Helix was inexpensive and seemed to do a good job at picking up dirt and hair, but the belt broke after two uses.  I had it set for the correct height setting and used it mainly on bare floor and an area rug.  It never seemed to glide well on the rug unless I switched it to the highest setting, but then it wouldn't pick-up hair and debris on the rug.  I called customer service and they tried to make me pay for a replacement belt plus shipping.  Only after questioning the quality of the machine, the customer service rep agreed to send me two belts at no cost to me.  Overall, I am not satisfied with the quality of this machine and regret purchasing this product.
Does Not Work!  We purchased this product several months ago, but do to a busy schedule and other distractions, did not attempt to use it until today. After reading the instructions, mixing the soap and water and plugging in I was ready to go, but the thing would not start; pushed the button a dozen times and nothing happened. So, I called Hoover's Customer Service, after a long wait and being disconnected another call and wait and the service rep told me to push on the button with all my might! I did and it started, and ran for about 15- 20 seconds and died. It would not re-start, period. So, I got out the pail and mop and scrubbed the tile floors in about the same amount of time spent messing around with the Floormate SpinScrub Hard FLoor Cleaner. I could not be more disappointed! And, since we waited so long to try it out, and have misplaced the receipt, we are stuck. Won't be fooled by Hoover again.
Not good for pet owners  I got on Amazon to look at new vacuum cleaners because I HATE this vacuum.  To my surprise it's in the first few results.  Sure, it's light weight and for the first year or so it did wonderfully.  Then the plastic housing around the retractable cord broke, getting wound up with the cord.  This makes pulling the cord out difficult and retracting it impossible. My cat has medium length hair and it gets caught in every nook and cranny of this vacuum, making emptying the canister more painful than if I had picked each of the hairs up with tweezers.  The worst is when it gets wrapped around the latch that holds the canister in place and I can't unfasten it in order to empty it. I do sweep up the cat litter, but what's in my carpet gets sucked up by the vacuum (which one would think is good).  This makes the entire inside turn into a grimy, nasty, horrid smelling mess.  If I try to rinse or wipe the inside of the canister it only makes the entire situation that much worse.  This might actually be a decent vacuum, but it you have a longer haired cat, stay away.
They call it "One Pass" technology - i'd just say "Pass"  File this review under "You get what you pay for"- I have had good luck with BISSELL products in the past- but I am not a fan of this one. I believe  that the "One pass" technology that they claim is just a marketing thing. The machine has a serious plastics odor when in use. The on switch is a basc toggle not well placed and the bagless design clogs fairly easily. (It dumps out fine but clogs inside the pipe that leads to the filter). Its fairly loud and it does not "Track" straight while you use it. But again- it was half what I paid for my last one so; as a "basic" vacuum cleaner, I give it a couple of stars.
I loved this when I first bought it  I loved this when I first bought it. I had MAJOR construction done and cleaned with it at the end of each day. Needless to say, the filter took a hit. When I tried to replace them, none of the new ones fit. The two at the rop are easily 'forced' in but the hepa filter on the bottom (one of the major reasons for buying it) doesn't. It's so I'll fitted, I have it duct taped to the bottom, compromising the air circulation and hence the suction. So sad. It was a good vacuum.
Lemon  The sweeper I got was a lemon-------no stars !!!!!! Just a thumbs down.
Pay twice as much and it sucks, not literally.  My girlfriend and I just got an apartment. We were going to go vacuum shopping when her mom said we could have her Dyson Vacuum (DC24), because she didn't like it very much. Now we know why.  My girlfriend and I have a cat, so of course we have lots of feathery cat toys. I cannot think of anything that should be EASIER for a vacuum to pick up than a couple shreds of a feather. This vacuum could not pick them up. I lifted one off the floor and set it back down, and after THREE times going over it, it finally got it. (Not very impressive.)  I noticed loose dirt, a small pebble, some loose threads from clothing, and feather bits, among other things, that were still left on the floor after going over it all several times. Mind you, these were in the middle of the floor, not in some hard to get place.  I thought, there must be something wrong! I cleaned out the container, I cleaned the filter, I even tried to pull as much hair off the roller thing as I could (it has a mechanism to take that part off for "easy" cleaning, but after 15 minutes, I still couldn't figure out how to do it), and then I went over the floor another several times.  It picked up about 30% I'd say, from beginning to end. When I was so frustrated with the quality of the suction, and finally gave up because it simply wasn't getting any better, I sat down and noticed dirt, loose clothing threads, and feather bits, all still left on the floor.  I would understand paying twice as much for a higher quality vacuum. I wouldn't even be mad if it was merely as good as other vacuums I have used (I used to have a job in my college's computer labs, and we had many different vacuums in the 4 years I had the job, plus all the vacuums I've ever used elsewhere), but this vacuum is awful. It was work trying to figure out how to clean it thoroughly. It required several goes at things that every other vacuum I've used only needed one. It still didn't get the job done, despite my extra efforts.  Doing some math, 1.) to pay twice as much, 2.) have to go over the area at least 3 times, spending 15 minutes cleaning it, and 3.) still only getting about a third of the dirt done:  2 * 3 * 3 = 12 times worse than an average vacuum cleaner. I know that Dyson is a big vacuum name right now, but from this model, I don't get it. This thing sucks, not literally.
Toss out the broom? Think again!  2 in 1? I don't thinks so...The whole reason I put based this product was to find a floor cleaner that swept and cleaned at the same time with little effort. This product claims to replace mopping and sweeping . Absolutely not. I have 2 kids, dog, cats. We have wood floors. Absolutely terrible! If a company claims that the product " Vacuums floors" then I shouldn't see Cheerios, rice, being pushed around EVERYWHERE!! When I emptied out the dirty tank, there was some solid matter in tank but I still had to go back and vacuum 50 percent of what is pushed around. I even tried tilting the vacuum head to pick up cheerios, food particles around the dining table..Nope..Just ignored them. As if sucking power needed to be increased by a landslide!  Sucked up 50 percent of particles and that's about it. I did a floor around 1000 SF. Kithen..Cereal on floor, rice, etc.. Absolutely worthless! I suppose if I deeply swept first, it would clean my floors but this product simply pushed anything in its way out of the way. My carpet vacuum did a better job ..
Would NOT recommend!!  :(  I purchased this vacuum directly from Bissell with great hopes of it picking up all the pet hair from our dog and cat.  This is not the case at all.  You have to turn the suction knob when you want to use the the hose/tool suction which is not a big deal BUT the end of the clear hose that attaches to the base of the vacuum does not fit snug so the suction to the hose is hardly there.  I wanted to post a review on the Bissell website but could not.  I have sent Bissell an email with my issues so we will see if or how they respond.
Know what you're getting  "Deluxe Edition" Shark Navigators? Like the NV22L with a 7yr warranty vs. 5yr and extra accessories (e.g. a "Premium" Pet Power Brush).  If you really want the warranty and attachments that come with the deluxe and can't buy from Costco, this seems an ok buy (you're paying an extra $30).  4 star vac, but 2 stars because of price in this listing ($143.29 + $16.49 shipping).  Upright Models: X "NV22L" (Lavender) with all the attachments. X "NV22T" (Blue) previously sold at Walmart does NOT have the attachments (they now stock the NV22L) X There is a red "NV26" that swiveled at the base like the liftaway which was sold at Kohls X There also used to even be a green (teal) one too  As for choosing a Shark? It's a great choice for most people that pick it. The Shark Navigator (by Euro-Pro) is one of the best reviewed vacs out there.  The seemingly most popular listing is:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Shark-Navigator-Upright-Bagless-Vacuum-Cleaner-NV22L/dp/B002IPHBNE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Shark Navigator Upright Bagless Vacuum Cleaner, NV22L</a>.  Pros: X Price X Consistent Suction (claims to be like Dyson for less) X Good with Pet Hair X Long Hose Length X Lightweight X Reviewed highly X Can manually turn the beater bar off (also goes off automatically in upright position)  Cons: X No HEPA filter (only liftaway model NV350 has HEPA) X Low power - only 10 Amps versus 12 normal (check bestbuy.com description if you don't believe me) X Balance - tips over easily X Fragile/feels cheap & toylike - some pieces break easily when tipped over/dropped X Has small dustbin - must empty frequently X No adjustable roller (bad for high-pile carpet as it will eat it) X Front-facing vent sometimes has a tendency to blow debris away from the vac (especially on hardwood/linoleum) X Poor manufacturer support if you have problems X Inconsistent build quality (made cheaply / sometimes get lemons / tons of "factory serviced" ones for sale everywhere) X Poor performance on bare floors (esp. with vent issue) X Dustbin has a hair-trigger that can create a mess easily X Extremely poor edge cleaning X Attachments are in a bag (not onboard)  Notes on standup (NV22) versus liftaway (NV350) model: X Only the liftaway offers HEPA filter (be careful, some liftaways don't have the HEPA, but you can just buy the HEPA filter/frame later if you don't get one with it) X Best place/price to buy the liftaway is Amazon, even after buying the HEPA filter separately  A lot of reviews have wrong information in them claiming to know this or that. The no HEPA and only 10 amp thing surprised me after I spent a long time hunting down some authoritative sources like shark's parts list and national retailer's specs.  In the end, I went with Costco's Shark Upright "deluxe" because it was $129 with 7yr warranty instead of 5yr (they were offering $30 off instant rebate too recently).  Good luck in your choice.
Hmmm  Box damaged, wheel damaged , but works
TINY vacuum  This vacuum is absolutely TINY. I recently had someone pick one up for me at Target thinking it would be a great deal for $279.  I expected the size to be comparable to a normal Dyson.  I couldn't be more wrong. The dirt cup on this thing couldn't hold much more than a cup. If I kept this thing, I would literally have to empty it multiple times on one carpet. Now on to the extremely poor engineering of the handle. My mother owns an older dyson animal and when you pull out the handle, it becomes the vacuum suction wand. On this thing, you have to pull the handle completely off the machine, extend the handle, then hook the top of the handle to the hose. A complete hassle. Opposite of what dyson's "simple" engineering is supposed to be.  I'll be the first to admit that I only vacuum once a week with 2 border collies, but there is no way that I could make this thing work. Save your money and buy something worthwhile or find another vacuum that actually has a decent sized cup.
TERRIBLE. Do not waste your money.  I needed a replacement for my previous Pet Hair Eraser (which lasted 6 years as my primary vacuum, and is still going strong as my back up), so I was excited to receive this new model. But after merely 2 weeks, I am sorely disappointed. Here are my thoughts:  I will give it ONE credit -- it does suck up most items on linoleum flooring.  Aside from that -- it has ZERO power or suction on any other surfaces. It cannot even suck up a piece of dirt from your average carpet unless you go very slowly, and go over the spot several times. Anything of substance, forget it. And no going over a spot quickly and hoping to clean anything up. I don't understand, as I have tried every combination of settings -- but it just truly does not have any power. My previous vacuum had amazing suction. It still does even after 6 years. This new one just doesnt cut it.  My biggest frustration with this vacuum -- is the fact that on any entrance rugs -- kind that are meant to go in a mud room or entry way, that have some texture to them and are intended to catch dirt and mud as people enter buildings or homes -- it will not suck up ANYTHING off these rugs. NOTHING. I have to literally go upstairs and get my other vacuum, lug it downstairs, and revacuum those area/entry rugs. Sometimes if I am lucky, if i hold it over one spot for a minute or so, it will suck up whatever is there. But not typically, and it makes no difference what settings and combinations I use. It is absolutely ridiculous!  If this wasn't a gift from my kids (even though I picked it out) I would be returning it. I am going to have to purchase ANOTHER vacuum or go back to my old one because this is not doing the job.  VERY disappointed.
Would not recommend.  I bought this in January and the roll brush attachment would not come off. I finally got it off and the tab to keep it on broke off. I could no longer carry it on the vacuum. Not convenient. Then last week the motor burned up! Would not recommend.
The product did not work as described. The washing side was corrupted and I could not use it at all. The pieces kept falling off and the suction strength is mediocre. I will never buy a used product from this seller again.
I bought this in 2008, when it got great reviews.  It turned out not to be the vacuum depicted.  It had a strong engine, and strong suction, but the plastic hose was so flimsy, it sucked inward on first use, and got worse with each reuse.  I frequently had to use a coat hanger to push normal household dust through the hose, which is part of the suction system. I spent more time trying to fix the problem than it would have taken to vacuum my entire house with a decent vacuum cleaner.  I finally bought a new hose, and the same thing happened.  I eventually went through 3 hoses, and gave up on the thing.
Update 1 year, 6 days after owning it: broken head, $200 to fix  This vacuum deserves 5 starts for how it functions for and picks up dirt/etc. But it deserves two stars for costing over $900, plus having two broken parts one year later, costing another $200. The powerhead broke and local dealer is replacing for $200. On a side note, the lever to detach the head, in order to use the suction wand to vacuum larger debris, broke as well.
Vac head and suction not a good match!  The power head is too light, doesn't make a good contact with the floor/carpet to be able to brush up the dirt for all that good suction. Not sure I would recommend this vac because of that and the expense.
Suction stopped after 2 months  Very dissappointed. Worked well for the first two months then the suction went away. Fairly good cleaning, I liked the fact that it scrubbed with clean water then sucked up the grimey stuff. Got my tile floors much cleaner the  a mop. Too bad it only lasted 60 days.
Average  It does the job, but not perfectly. It's great for the price, but takes a few passes to pick stuff up. It also seems to have broken already, which is very disappointing.
Don't waste your money  By far the WORST vacuum I've ever purchased. It simply does not pick up! And on another note, it's absurd how short the cord is for a vacuum.
Good points - and bad points!  Although this vacuum is very heavy and I have a bad back, I purchased it anyway as I have 6 children and a dog. I was looking for something with powerful suction, low on dust emission, and durable. O don't have to carry it up and down stairs, so I thought my back would be alright with it. I will say that this vacuum fulfills the first 2 objectives (great suction, low dust), but is severely lacking in durability. I bought my vacuum from an authorized dealer. I took it back less than a year after purchase because one of the bottom swivel wheels kept falling out. This turned out to be a real pain (literally) as I had to tip the vacuum over, and hold the wheel in as I tried to put it upright again. The dealer supposedly replaced the bottom panel and the problem went away - temporarily. It began happening again about a year later. Same wheel. This time I took it back and he 'adjusted it' so the wheel would stay in, and so that I would not have to pay for a new panel. This adjustment lasted about 2 months, and now BOTH wheels are falling out. I contacted Miele directly, hoping they would stand behind this $600 vacuum. They have now told me that this will not be covered. Why you ask? Apparently, part of the reason is that i actually dared to purchase a HEPA filter (without the Miele name on it, but same exact thing)! This leads to the other problem I have with this machine: you buy it at a dealer, they tell you to bring it for a "FREE tune-up" once a year, you take it in and they tell you that you must purchase a $60 HEPA filter!!! So, being one to try to avoid a rip-off if possible, I went on Amazon, found the SAME filter (without the name) for $10, and because I have done this terrible thing, it VOIDS all warranty on my vacuum. Are you kidding me?? This has nothing to do with wheels falling off! And, I would like to add that the shiny silver panel on the bottom of this expensive vacuum might look like steel, but it is plastic. Thus, my problem with wheels falling off. So, all in all, this would be a great vacuum except for: the cost, weight, durability, and service scams.
The suction hose on the bottom has to be manually adjusted every time we use it
Works for the price that you pay for.
Disappointing at best!  This vacuum seems to have a reasonably powerful motor with good suction and it is quite maneuverable and lightweight. On the other hand, It puts out a terrible smell of dust when it is running which is an indication that the filter doesn't work very well.  The Swipes attachment is pretty useless - very poor design.  It is basically a dust mop with a vacuum attachment on the front edge.  All of the hair & diet stick to the mop so nothing goes into the vacuum. Terrible design & this is the only hard floor attachment that came with this vacuum. The owner's manual shows additional attachments but doesn't provide any parts numbers or any info on ordering additional parts and/or attachments.  So glad I didn't pay full price for this item!
You sometimes get what you pay for.  I assume you have read all the good reviews of this vacuum cleaner and I agree with much of what they say so I won't belabor those points. Here is my summary: LIKES 1. light 2. Rug brush can be disabled (turned off) 3. Great suction for its size. 4. HEPPA filter. 5. Tools attached. 6. Simple switch from floor to hose. 7. Bagless DON'T LIKES 1. Hose too short 2. Filter clogs too fast. Dirt tank emptying annoying and "dirty." 3. Small plastic parts break easily (cord holder, dirt chamber latch) SUMMARY   Like it, use it, looks a bit ummm wounded with duct tape holding it together.
Not a great vacuum to say the least  Not a great vacuum to say the least. This is small and the suction is really horrible, especially when using the attachments, compared to other vacuums. Not a big fan of the attachments and the lack of  holders for the attachments. Would not buy this item again or recommend it to anyone to buy.
If you are looking for something that looks better and is not as cumbersome as a shop-vac to cleanup fresh spills on a hard floor surface then THIS IS DEFINITELY FOR YOU.  In fact because it has a squeegee attached it is even BETTER than a shop-vac when it comes to cleaning up spills. However  if you are looking for something that will actually scrub floors better than, or even equal to just a mop and bucket and brush  well then this is really NOT for you.  It doesnt do that very well at all.  Unless of course you are attempting to scrub something up that just then fell on the floor.  Then it MIGHT work effectively.  But for scuff marks etc. that have been there for a while (as in a day or two), it doesnt cut it.
Horrible Vacuum, Horrible Experience with Hoover  This vacuum is horrible.  After only about 6 months, it picked dirt up, off the floor, only to spit it back at my feet.  What's worse is that Hoover, despite it obviously being their product, refused to do anything to make it right.  The customer service was just as horrible as the vacuum and the rep I spoke to was curt and rude.  They refused to do anything to help...except point me in the direction of a dealer than may be able to fix it (at my expense)...an hour and half away from my home.  I will never buy another Hoover again.
Hoover Vacuum doesn't measure up to my old Hoover  Unit falls over easily, dirt falls out of the vacuum after using when stopped. Plus when not using the power roller on hard wood floors it doesn't pick up dirt. One of the units will not easily slide over plush carpet. Very disappointed in quality.
Unhappy  I purchased this vacuum through Amazon in March. I routinely clean all filters and take very good care of it. The vacuum already is having problems. The suction power is already decreased to the point it won't pick up. It makes an odd sucking sound like it is clogged. Overall I'm not happy at all with this vacuum. One pass technology is not just and overstatement it simply isn't true. Will not purchase again. Hoping I can return the item to be fixed or for a new one seeing it is less than a year old.
Too harsh and hard to push  We have wood laminate flooring and bought the FloorMate to make scrubbing the floor easier.  It was hard to push.  Once we used it on our floor, we could see spin marks in the flooring.  We contacted the flooring company to see if these could be fixed.  We were told that we just have to live with the spin marks or have the flooring replaced.  If you have wood laminate flooring, don't buy this product.
Waste of money  Waste of money.  Within 6 months, the foot pedal broke. 4+ weeks for the part.  Now, 3 months later - the rollers no longer turn. Haven't had the heart to take it apart to see what the problem is.  I no longer have a high opinion of the Hoover name. So disappointed.
Not worth the money.  Pros - Easy to use on on carpet and wood floor.  Easy to clean canister.  Cons - Very difficult to use hose.  Doesn't stretch very easy and need to use back to move the hose.  Not engineered very well and the design has flaws.  Hate using this feature and that is a feature that is needed when cleaning the stairs.  When vacuuming the carpet, it doesn't always pick up pieces and the vacuum has to be run over the object several times to pick it up.  First Dyson bought and probably the last.  The mark up on these vacuums is to high for the poor design on the hose.
Read Consumer Reports First...Lots of "Engineering"..Mediocre Performance.....Short-Lived  I bought this product about a year or so ago and now I'm replacing it already. I only have one bedroom with carpet and do have a short-haired dog. The vacuum is light weight and very maneuverable but that's about it...performance is mediocre. It looks like a lot of engineering went into it but it's just not a very good at cleaning and very costly as compared to others. Do yourself a favor and read Consumer Reports before you buy this product. I wish I had. I'm replacing it already, died on me this weekend. I just ordered a Hoover for 95.00 as compared to the 300.00 I spent on this dud of a vacuum.
This works great except for the overwhelming smell of the Febreez.  Otherwise I would give it 5 stars.
A Disappointment  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Eureka-4236AZ-Comfort-Clean-Bagless-Upright-Vacuum-Cleaner/dp/B0027VTDY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Eureka 4236AZ Comfort Clean Bagless Upright Vacuum Cleaner</a>&nbsp;I found it a little difficult to assemble in that the holes could have lined up a little better.  Also, a part was missing--it was the hose rack on the bottom of the back of the machine.  I emailed the company, which directed me to a local repair shop.  My first belt broke after 4 months of use, the second, a week later.  I agree with other comments about how heavy this machine is.
SENT BACK.  DID NOT WORK WELL. VERY CHEAPLY MADE.
The product looks great and it very easy to put it together  The product looks great and it very easy to put it together. It did a great job at cleaning my carpet the first 3 times I used it. I was very satisfy until the fourth use, when i noticed that the floor brush was not moving. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to rotate. I followed the manual to check for jammed stuff but I was disappointed to find out that the belt was already broken.
HATE it!  HATE it! I only still have it because I  paid way too much for it. Everytime I use it I want to throw it away. The hose is attached to the canister in away that makes you fight with it the whole time.  The spinning brush locks up all the time so you have to stop and unlock it. And the cord is not nearly long enough.  Obviously the person who designed NEVER used it.
Way to heavy  I have owned this vacuum for over 2 years and enjoyed it at first.  It has great suction and the hands tools are nice.  But now, the hose for the hand tools has split open.  And it seems like every time I use it, it grows more heavy to work with.  So if you have any issues with upper body strength at all, pass this vacuum up - it is monstrously heavy! It is also very loud and blows hot air right where you hold it onto the base to use it on the stairs. There are too many issues with this vaccum for me to recommend it...particularly when I am looking to replace my investment after only 2 years.
I had another Hoover Wind Tunnel which I loved. This one is poorly made  This vacuum was literally impossible to push on a plush carpet. Changing settings was of no help. I had another Hoover Wind Tunnel which I loved.  This one is poorly made.  Tools are cheap and don't stay attached while vacuuming. I used it once and called Hoover as the sticker suggests.  Their comment was that it was my carpet and I should take it to a service company!  No help!  I returned it.  I did end up  spending another $100 and bought the Hoover React Professional!  Awesome.
This is the worst vacuum I have ever owned  This is the worst vacuum I have ever owned. I have a friend who has a Dyson with the ball design - it's wonderful, but this model is junk and so non-functional that I can't wait to get rid of it. My daughter bought it for me as a gift, she had no idea of the differences between the two styles. Yes, it has great suction, but only if you're using it on regular pile carpeting, and don't expect it to do corners, edges, or under furniture or cabinets because it sits so high it doesn't fit under anything. If you try to vacuum a throw rug, it will suck it up and make the loudest, most annoying sound you have ever heard! It also will not work on my thick pile carpeting without getting stuck and I'm unable to push it. The "handy" wand assembly with attachments is incredibly stiff and awkward to handle, basically making it unusable. The price of this piece of junk is ridiculous as well. I had an upright Electrolux before this Dyson and it was 10 times the vacuum the DC33 is.
disappointed  The attachment piece  broke literally 2 minutes into using. The plastic was to cheap and the piece broke after tapping on the wood siding of my stai'r Hoover is sending out a replacement but haven't been able to use yet. UI feel it will do the same thing next
Not in as good of shape.  Came missing an attachment. Looks like plastic was rubbed all over with steel wool. Was advertised as very good. Not true
Died at 16 months  This was a very bad purchase. It was an adequate vacuum until the battery died after 16 months. The replacement battery costs as much as the vacuum. I MUCH prefer the Shark Navigator Freestyle SV1106 Stick Vacuum, it works well, has a long run time, the dust cup is ample, and very easy to remove and clean. It is frequently on sale for $80.
Stopped working too soon.  The vacuum cleaner stopped working after using it maybe 5 times. We only use it for area carpets, so we are very disappointed in this product.
Fantastic on carpet  but a hassle for anything else  Beyond doubt the DC25 works great on carpet and sucks the dirt right out.  Where it falls down is using the attachments.  The hose is simply too short and you wind up putting so much tension on it that it pulls the vacuum base.  I find my self literally carrying the base around to avoid having it bang the furniture.  The problem is worst on hardwood floors and stairs.  On stairs I don't even bother trying to leave it sitting on the ground.  On hardwood floors it will vacuum almost all of the toe-kick area under cupboards - this is actually quite impressive - but you still need to run the wand around to get the remaining crumbs, dirt, etc. You'll wind up holding the base or putting a foot on it to make it stay put or it'll just bash off your cabinets.  If you're like me, you spend more time vacuuming the room edges, stairs, window sills than you do on the actual carpet.  The DC25 will be right there, banging on your ankles, bouncing off the furniture and cabinets or you'll be carrying the whole thing.
Unless that filter is spotless it gets loud and stops suction..you must clean filter every time.
Horrible Canister  The canister is a major pain to empty. We have 1 dog and long carpet, and the fibers and all the dirt gets jammed up high in the canister. When I open the lid to dump it in the trash, almost nothing falls out. I have to use barbecue tools to scrape out all the dirt. My whole arm gets dusty and I end up breathing in a cloud of  dust and getting it on my clothes. I never thought I'd have to be be so intimate with the contents of my vacuum.
Beater bar wouldn't beat carpet returned item  Received item box I damaged opened it up and assembled Handel and tools to Vacuum. Then tried to vacuum my floor only to find out that the beater bar would not beat when stationary on the carpet no matter what height setting I had it on, smelt smoke of burning rubber band trying to move the bar. Returned the same day to amazon to get a refund so I could buy a differnt one
Heavy  Very heavy and cumbersome, much wider than my other vac.  I work out at the gym every day but just couldn't deal with this everyday .
We purchased this vacuum 6 months ago because it was recommended by Consumer Reports  DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM! It is a piece of junk! We purchased this vacuum 6 months ago because it was recommended by Consumer Reports. We have replaced the belt over 10 times. We run it on the highest setting and have tried various replacement belts. The design has a serious defect! It is NOT worth your time and money!
Spend more.  I wish I'd spent more.  While this sweeper does have decent suction I can't use the lowest setting even on very low pile rugs.  It won't budge.  I have to raise it to level 3 to move it so I don't think it's doing as good a job as my old Hoover.  The dirt capacity is very small and I have to empty it 3 times to even sweep a 12 by 12 rug.  Granted I do have pets, but I've never had a sweeper with such a small containment area.  Also emptying it is frustrating as the bottom opens but you actually have to pull the lint, pet hair and dirt out as it seems to stick.  The only thing I like about this Hoover is the retractable cord.  I wish I could afford to buy another vacuum.
Dissatisfied  Worked great for awhile. Went to clean it and it plastic pieces won't stay connected. Also, there is a huge annoying sound from the unit from canister not making a tight seal to the vacuum. I don't think I'll buy anything from this company again.
It does clog!  TThe Dyson DC07 does clog!  We have had the Dyson 07 for 2.5 years. When we first got it, we really loved it.  It was easy and fun to use.  It now sits idle as I contemplate repair versus buying a new cleaner.  The problem is that it is clogged.  Not in the easily accessible locations; but deep in the bowels of the  Bin Cyclone assembly.  You know the thing that makes the  Dyson different.  Basically in the center of the collection Bin is a Tube for fine dust collection.  This is where the clog began.  It then continued up the tube to the rootcyclone assembly.  Here the direction of the air movement reverses to go down the cyclone tubes.  The tubes empty into a circular cavity . This is the point I got stuck trying to disassemble the unit.  Somewhere pass this circular cavity is the last part of the clog.  If I decide to buy a new vacuum I will continue my disassembly forcing the unit to give up the secret clog.  I would highly not recommend the purchase of this unit; but would consider the newer upgraded model DC14.  It looks like the rootcyclone/bin assembly has been redesigned.  Huh. I wonder why??
highly recommend a different product and even a different company  I have had this vacuum for only 4 months and it is already broken. I was using it on my regular living room carpet and the motor just gave out. Prior to it breaking I had actually just cleaned out the filter and the canister was empty. During its short 4 month lifespan, it had acceptable (not great) performance. highly recommend a different product and even a different company!
Doesn't have very much suction  We bought this as a vacuum that we would need for a year and a half and it has turned out that it doesn't have great suction.  the hose gets clogged often too.  It's pretty lightweight, but not very good quality.
Not Good Quality  It stopped working after a 1.5 years.
but wouldn"t recommend for carpets  thought it would have a power head being a "pet lover " vacuum... it does work, but wouldn"t recommend for carpets.
From the beginning this item never worked well.  I kept it a while hoping performance might improve. Then it stopped working.  Purchased this item Oct 2013.  The return policy is that it can only be returned within the 1st month. It would dump a puddle of water on the floor instead of spraying water out evenly.  If you held the spray button down continuously it would only feed water occasionally.  It did not vacuum up the water very well as the floor remained very wet after several passes of vacuuming.  If I wanted the floor dry I had to follow up mopping the floor with towels.  The brushes did not scrub  very well as you had to make multiple passes to get any tough spots totally up and again you had to make multiple passes of vacuming which still left the floor very wet.  .  The commercials on TV showed it leaving the floor only slightly damp or very dry but I never had a similar result.  In May it totally stopped dispensing soap and water and at this point I wanted to return it but the return policy only gives you one month to do so. It is going on the trash heap as it is worthless.
Disappointed  I sent it back twice and finally gave up. The rewind cord didn't work both times. The model was advertised to have a button to turn off while vacuuming bare floors. It didn't have it. It also didn't have a crevice device.
Not worth the price  After receiving and putting the unit together, the flexible hose separated from the handle during use. It did not pick up the amount of dirt hair in the carpet as advertised.  My current Bissell vacuum cleaner picked up what the Dirt Devil left behind.
Dyson DC35 Not Worth The Price  Gets low rating because for this kind of price you get a cleaner that works on high power for less than ten minutes! So basically at $300 bucks that's 30 dollars a minute which is quite ridiculous. I am sorry I fell for slick ads.  But there is more.  Thinking I could still run it using power cord while battery charges was a complete bust. It only runs on a battery. So I needed to wait 3.5 hrs for battery to recharge. YUCK!
not worth the cheap cost,, poor quality  THIS is the worst vacuum cleaner I have ever gotten. I was impressed by the quick delivery,  it came  on time. But when I opened the package, the disappointment started. The vacuum is very flimsy and made with very light, cheap plastic body, It was easy to assemble following simple directions. and three screws. it is easy to maneuver and the attachments were well placed ( so they don't fall off )  and work well. The first vacuum was terrific, it worked well, sucking up dirt and dust and with ease and cleaned my floors very well. It is a bit too light to take turns with out tipping, but I figured for the money I invested, It would do fine, just don't vacuum too fast. the second time I ever used it,, two days later, It would not suck the dirt up. I emptied it, again, completely taking the canister apart per instructions, checked all hoses and made sure all were not clogged and damaged and put back on tightly. It was still not sucking dirt. I took it apart and removed the filter, dusting it off, unclogging the filter and put it all back together. It worked for 10 min.  then quit altogether, ''  So the second vacuum it ever did was a complete failure.  It is definatley worth a trash bin,, not my hard earned money. My recommendation... spend a few more  bucks and get an appliance you can actually  used more than once,
You won't believe how awful it is to empty the dust/dirt canister.......  I would give this thing 4 stars for cleaning ability. But to empty the dust/dirt canister: you had better do it outdoors, & wear a dust mask. Then, no matter how careful I am, some/a lot of the dust swirls around & gets on my shoes, the porch stoop, etc. God forbid you try to empty it in your apartment or house. (If you think I'm exaggerating, buy one, & try it). Of course; I empty it, or try to, in a garbage bag of some sort.  See, there's a reason dirt bags were invented for vacuum cleaners: THEY MAKE IT VERY SIMPLE TO DISPOSE OF THE DUST & DIRT! What's the reason for "bagless" vacuums? To save a whole $2 or $3 on a bag? Trust me, it's not worth it.  There are a lot of other annoyances with this thing. Think you're going to clean carpeted stairs with the little pet hair tool that you fit on the (way too short) hose? Works great, for the first 4 or 5 stairs. Then, try carrying the vac up the rest of the stairs: it's heavy, awkward, & wider than the stairs. So there's no way to balance it on a stair step, & vacum at the same time.  I left out a bunch of other annoyances with this thing; but that's a start......
Bad Purchase  This product was purchased via recommedations on both Amazon and Consumer Reports.  We did not have the vaccum for six weeks before we had to have it serviced.  Sears was the only service rep in our area.  They had the unit for two months and had to replace the entire hose unit ($178 but not paid by us).  I get the unit home, it is working great--suction, etc.  Then I notice dirt in the red tubes and the unit is not performing as well in regards to suction.  I don't see anything in the manual about this issue.  We take the lid off and remove the dirt from the red tubes.  The dirt is packed into the tubs and we had to use a wooden skewer to remove it all, which ended up being over a quart of packed dirt.  Granted, we have two dog but no other vaccum has has this problem before.  I called Hoover to ask if I was doing something wrong.  They said I would have to take it back to the repair people and I absolutely should have not taken it apart.  I will not take it back and risk two months of not having a vaccum.  I will continue to clean the red tubes out until I can't use the machine anymore.  I would never, ever purchase a Hoover product again.
Grrr...  Every time I vacuum I am reminded how much I hate this vacuum. The attachments are not easy to use and the handle is awkward once you are trying to use the attachments, if I encounter something like a cheerio on my hardwood floors it just pushes it around until I lift the darn the thing and put it on top of the cereal and the air coming out of the machine is so strong that it blows the dust bunnies away from it so I have to chase them around.  Absolutely not worth the money and I so wish I could go back in time and get something else.
It was great the first time I used it  It was great the first time I used it. Then the second time, it wouldn't turn on.  I spent $50.00 and it only worked once. Don't waste your money.
Piece of junk with terrible warranty and service  This thing is an expensive piece of junk no where near the quality of the old Dyson vacs.  First of all it is kind of hard to control.  Second the warranty is extremely short compared to the old Dysons.  Ours broke a week after the warranty expired.  The roller no longer spins.  When we called, rather than even make suggestions on what may be wrong, they said sorry out of warranty take it to a repair shop.  I won't buy another Dyson product after this.
Not happy at all  The vacuum doesnt work. Customer service took days to reply. I have to drive 45 minutes to get someone to fix it. Not happy at all. Horrible customer service. Horrible product that doesnt work!
Cheap is as cheap does  Underpowered and the self-preservation shut off is confusing most purchasers will think this thing is broken because it takes a full 24 hours to reset
It does not clean dog hair and requires much time for cleaning and maintainence.  I don't believe that I have ever given a bad review except when products from China were delivered and completely unusable.  I am making an exception in this case.  Now, to be truthful, we have a huge Golden Retriever who sheds by the second.  They are known for this, so a vacuum is extremely important.  In addition, this vacuum got very high ratings from Consumer Reports even mentioning how well it handles pet hair. The appliance worked okay-just okay, but acceptable for about a month although I constantly had to clean out the tunnel of dog hair.  After about a month, the hair that it picked up was spit back out on the carpet in little hair balls.  Everywhere.  It actually looked worse than before I vacuumed.  In addition, the bags are very expensive and extremely small-they must be changed about every fourth time I vacuum!  I put in a new bag, cleaned out the tunnel completely, combed the bristles on the carpet roller to no avail.  I sweep up the dog hair, and spits out hair balls in all directions.  It does seem to be okay with regular dirt and debris, but there is nothing spectacular about it, and I would argue that if you have an animal, keep looking.
Disappointed :(  I highly do not recommend this product.  I rarely write reviews unless I seriously need to inform other buysers.  Within less than 7 months, this vacuum cleaner DIED! it doesn't even suck up anything! i was highly disappointed
Expensive and poorly built  Broke within the year,  wheel/ball shattered and flew off while vacuuming.  Also makes weird squeaky noises when moving the unit back a forth.  Was hoping for more and disappointed in purchase.
Cleaning the constantly dirty filter makes this otherwise good vacuum a bad choice.  This vacuum has a lot of good features:  -lightweight, comparable to a lightweight Oreck -Adjustable height handle -bagless -easy grip, movable handle -gets in tight spots b/c it's not the standard 15" width -very good suction and power for it's size -super easy controls, simple buttons and features that get the job done -has a brushroll off feature for hardwood floors (not all do in this price range.)  I owned it and year and got rid of it.  Why?  2 main reasons: 1) The cleanup.  Usually a bagless is just a dump it out and clip it back together sort of deal.  This one has a horrible design: the filter is inside the dust bin, it gets clogged instantly, and reduces suction immediately.  After every dirt dump, I saw the fabric-like filter with all of it's grooves and crannies getting packed with fine dirt.  Imagine going through every groove and cleaning it!  A mess and a waste of time.  They say you can buy new filters but it'd be too expensive to buy a new one every time it got filthy.  Expect to replace the delicate filter at least yearly.  They say you can soak it in water, but it still was a mess to flick out the wet filth, dry, and replace.  It's a little on the noisy side too.  If you want your fingers in filth daily, routing out little vertical slats of a filter, get this badly designed vacuum.  The cord is really, really short.  It also had a horrible smell for the first few months...really bad.  I got a slightly heavier but better designed Hoover Windtunnel UH70210 15" width, bagless, "pet" with cord rewind and no filter inside the dust bin that clogs instantly.  It was over double the price of the Eureka but worth it.  For the most part, I've given up on Eureka.
Shark vacuums not for use on area rugs!!  This is the 3rd Shark model I have tried in the past several weeks.  I also tried the NV352 and the Shark Rocket.  All 3 models pulled up the fibers from my area rugs.  The Shark Rocket was the worst.  I called the company and was actually told Shark makes the vacuums with so much suction now it will pull up fibers.  If it's going to ruin your rugs, what's the point? My daughter lives in an apartment which is carpeted and it seemed to work ok on her carpet. But it cannot be used on area rugs. It will pull up ALOT of fibers.
Same Model, Different Result  The HEPA filter "drawer" will not stay shut when vacuuming.  I sent a note to Hoover customer service and they directed me to a local service dealer who has atrocious reviews online (people wait months to get their sweepers repaired, rude employees, etc).  I am saddened as I have always owned a Hoover and am surprised that this model (which is the same as I had previously) is so inferior to its predecessor.  The cord return is hard to press down as well.  Will be buying another vacuum (not a Hoover).
Great on bare floors will not work on carpets. Do not buy this product.
Misleading Advertsising for this product  This vacuum CLAIMS to be steam vac--but is NOT. The water you add does not heat up--it's only as hot as your tap =costs as much as really good ones that really heat the water in the unit. Don't buy this if you want a steam vac.
BROKE AFTER 3 MONTHS. AWEFUL VACUUM!
not satisfied  After trying the Hoover wind tunnel, I had to return the product because I was dissatisfied for two reasons. 1) the hose was extremely stiff. Making moving the machine very difficult. 2) The floor brush is too high to go under my radiators. I did like the upholstery brush though.
The turbine on the small turbo brush head is installed wrong (reversed), and the belt is missing, making it useless
Loved it for the first ten times I used it  Loved it for the first ten times I used it.  Have barely used it since and now it won't function at all.  Shuts on and off  randomly and just stops altogether.  Took it to a professional Hoover vacuum technician/shop and they couldn't fix it.  This product has barely been used in our home; we have other vacuums.  This was just for the quick pick up here and there.  Won't turn on at all now; completely does not work.  Highly disappointed in this product from Hoover.
It is suitable only for bald people and no pet at home  The brush design is very bad - a few hairs and dog wool prevents it from further use. And it takes to clean it by hands every few minutes (unpleasant and not very effective). Simple design would work better than spinning brush, but I don't see simple attachment for this model. My money is wasted.
Worse relaibility that a 50$ vacuum cleaner  I bought this vacuum as I has heard great things about Oreck. It was pricey but if it was good and reliable, I was ok with that. I also liked the advertised feature to be able to move from carpet to hard wood floor seamlessly. Though I did not like how it bunched up in the bagless area, it is a bad design in my opinion, it did as advertised the first year. After using it very seldom last year, after less than 2 years,  it simply broke, no suction whatsoever. For that price ( around 300$ ), it is absolutely not worth it and clearly not recommended.
Do not buy this trash  I bought one from Wal-Mart.  The rubber piece would not stay on it.  After months of back and forth and mailing it in to Hoover, they sent me a new one.  After less than a year it overheats and stops working.  Two vacuum cleaners in less than two years.  My previous vacuum lasted ten years.  This is trash.
Customer service  #Dyson customer service is terrible! Bought a present on Oct 7th for Christmas and was told I'd have 30 days from Christmas to return. Today I was told 30 days from date of sale and I'm out of luck. So,if you want a vacumn or any dyson product don't expect good customer service!
DC07 with floor tool  Based upon its high ratings and previous customers' comments, I purchased this vacuum cleaner. It was very confusing to assemble (it was supposed to be assembled already!) and the manuals did not help. Using it in an upright position, the DC07 vacuumed way below my expectations. As an example, I vacuumed one room with the Dyson in its upright position. In the same area where I'd just vacuumed, I swept with a regular broom. There was more dirt in the swept-up pile than in the Dyson dirt collector. The floor tool performed even worse. I've returned the item. I do not recommend this vacuum cleaner.
Cleans so-so but won't work at all after a few uses.  Very disappointed.  It worked so so to clean tile floors/grout, the best part being the vacuum feature to suck up the dirty water.  however, the scrub brushes do not really reach down into the grout lines (and they are not even deep).  It is also incredibly noisy - with all of the super quiet motor technology these days seems ridiculous to have a motor like this.  Worst of all, it stopped working properly during its 4th use.  Would not vacuum up the water and the dispenser control no longer worked dumping all of the water onto the floor at once.  I have read that the older model worked great and was built to last.  Too bad Hoover decided to "new and improve" it.
does not suck very well  Plastic feels cheap, does not suck very well, and the vacuum head is very steeply angled so I have bend to use it properly.
Buying refurbished is Luck of the Draw -- I was not lucky  I was so excited to buy this refurbished Dyson. I read all of the reviews and it seemed too good to be true. It was! I ordered my vacuum and chose free super saver shipping. It took nearly TWO weeks to get the vacuum. It came in an unmarked box and contained no packing slip, no owner's manual, nothing. Two accessories were broken, not in working order. I'm not sure if the canister part fit correctly, because there was NO owner's manual. I didn't even turn the vacuum on, because I didn't want to use it if I was going to return it for these reasons. I purchased the extended warranty that was sold with the vacuum on Amazon. I called the company to inquire about getting the parts fixed, because the vacuum came with no contact information. They told me that my vacuum is NOT COVERED, because it is refurbished. They don't cover refurbished vacuums. It seems to me that they are selling warranties that they have no intention of honoring. They should not be sold with this vacuum. So, I am returning my vacuum, and now I have to go through a lengthy cancellation process with the warranty company. I will bite the bullet and buy the Dyson new. Then maybe I can actually write a review on the product!
Worst most annoying electronic purchase ever  My wife keeps buying these.  Worst most annoying electronic purchase ever.  Finally the 4th one stopped.  Four in 7 years. Self propelled feature breaks easily and vacuum becomes useless.  Will absolutely never buy another wind tunnel.  Ever.
Strike 2 for LG  strike 2 for LG, May 1, 2013  This review is from: LG Kompressor Total Care Upright Vacuum Cleaner, LuV400T (Kitchen) They have a 5 year warranty for vacuums. Model # indicated vac was made in 2010. Obviously it is under 5 years old. The poorly designed hing for the lid to canister broke off yesterday. Called LG Parts. You get Panama, gal confirms it's less than 5 years old, but without purchase date it isn't under warranty. Gives me a # to call to order new canister. They don't have one in stock. Will take 2 to 3 weeks to get.(I bet it comes from Panama! They don't sell parts from there) 100.18 plus shipping. Also our model # WM2050C front load washer, 3 years old, known to have a poor design flaw that causes it to leak with each load. There's a guy on youtube that describes his pain in dealing with LG for this. And how it's a known flaw for that year's model. He got no help either. Bottom line, with the cost of these two items I'd say STAY AWAY FROM LG products. Not sure they do anything right.
You're better off if the thing DOES break.  The vacuum worked okay for a couple of years and then just decided to stop working one day.  Even though we rarely used the self driving feature, it broke.  But even though we weren't using the self drive feature at the time and would have happily used the vacuum without it, it won't budge at all, even with the self drive turned to off.  It just freezes the entire machine like putting breaks on.  So we went out to buy a new vac and this time ended up with the low end Dyson vac thinking that we'd just get the Hoover fixed under warranty.  Forget the Hoover!  I went over the same piece of carpet that the Hoover died on and pulled up a full canister worth of dirt that the Hoover left behind.  No point in getting warranty work on something that obviously wasn't doing the job in the first place.  I've owned Hoover vacs for over 30 years, but they just lost a customer.  I've got far more into my carpet than their vacuum is worth.
I didn't even like this vacuum and it stopped working after a couple of months.  I was told to cut the cord off and send it in, which I did. It's been over a month, and 2 phone calls, and I still don't have a replacement.  I keep being told that it's out of stock. The cord wouldn't stay on the vacuum.
The handle is broke. Can't click in pulls out as I vacume  Received a broken  acume retuning it
the product ordered was materially misrepresented.  The product arrived on time but was not in working order.  One wheel was broken.  The metal pipe for the hose attachment was crushed on one side making the connection difficult.  The vacuum itself only remained on if you held the on/off button down.  This was a disappointing purchase.
This vaccuum has been a terrible investment.  It spits dirt and hair etc out the back end while you are trying to suck up dirt etc in front of you! A true nightmare.  Also, it has easily cleaned parts yes - however - the parts are very difficult to attach back in an air tight manner!  Please don't make the same mistake and go with this cheap product.
big noise  oh,my god! so so big noise! I want to return it! Trust me,don't buy it,it does not worth the price,I don't like it
hose were you connect to vacuum comes apart  actually not real impressed the attachments come unattached to easily and the hoses came apart were you connect it to the vaccum have to reglue it or something unless you will replace it
Worst Vacuum I've ever had  I realize I am in the minority when it comes to  a Dyson - but this vacuum is very (very) overrated.  Yes, it does a good job on carpets/pet hair, but that's IT.  Try spilling some rice on the floor - the Dyson can't get it up, you'll vacuum over (and over and over) that little speck on the floor, because the Dyson will zoom right over it and not grab it.  Forget picking up the stray coin, or the beans from the beanie baby that the dog ripped open - you'll drive yourself crazy!  This vacuum is heavy, bulky, awkward and hard to maneuver around and under furniture and other things.  The "stick" is too small and too short as well.  I.HATE.THIS.VAC!!
The suction is NOT "great for the price" in my opinion  UPDATE: Less than a year later and the stupid thing is broken. I unclogged it but it's still broken. Piece of crap!  All the reviews said "great suction for the price," but I disagree. I just received this vacuum and was disappointed that the hose clogged super fast when I was cleaning up after my bunnies (small pieces of hay, some bits of hard food, and little poops, and bedding). I had to clean out the hose several times just to get any suction back.  After I unclogged the hose for the 10th time, I vacuumed my downstairs. Same issue with clogging. It picks up well enough I guess, but IMO it should only cost about $50. It's so hard to know which reviews to trust:-/
I bought this vacuum last year. The suction was never great and after a year of light use its already not working. I watched a few YouTube videos about possible problems and fixes and its still not working. There is NO suction! Spend your money elsewhere unless you only want an ok vacuum for a year or so.
Melting Vacuum  This is my second of this model because I had to return the first one due to the same problem. This thing has smelled like fire and outgassed in my home so much so that it made me nauseous. I have had this thing for 2 months (my replacement) and I had the one before for 2 months as well. I finally took it apart and found that the 2 piece brush bar sodered itself apart (metal bearing thing) and the other half of the brush bar does not spin anymore after smelling like melted plastic and metal for the two months I have vacuumed with it and I am returning this poor excuse for a vacuum. Do not buy!
As with all newer versions of previously working excellent models, they have cut a few corners  As with all newer versions of previously working excellent models, they have cut a few corners. Suction as great as ever, but very fiddly construction make this tricky to empty and to detach hose for corners etc. And they have used the old profit making standby of shortening the cord, so the first thing I did was buy an extension cord to be able to actually clean two rooms without endlessly changing the wall socket.
Doesn't suck well, dog hair got stuck inside and outside!  I had a DYSON pet vacuum that worked great for 8 years- until it broke. I got this one, and was VERY disappointed.  It was brand new and it doesn't suck very well-it was NOT sucking up small things from the carpet.  We have a yellow lab dog (short, thin hair)and the dog hair was getting clogged constantly in the spinner brush.  The dog hair was also all over the outside of the vacuum like a magnet!  The "head" of the vacuum isn't wide enough and the electrical cord is too short.  Right after I bought it, it went on "closeout" and the price dropped $100+.  I have to return this since it's not working properly. DYSON claims their vacuums "never lose suction" yet this one wasn't sucking property from the beginning! I expect quality from DYSON-especially for the $500 price tag! DO NOT BUY!
Don't buy it!  Call me stupid but this was the 3rd Floormate I bought!  This one lasted about 9 months before it stopped working.  The other 2 were not the deluxe model and I doubt if the 2nd one I bought lasted 6 months.  The Floormate was the perfect fit for my tile floors but I wasn't planning on any of them lasting such a short time.  I am in the market for another machine that does what the Floormate does but lasts a lot longer.  Customer service was no help.  Never again will I buy Hoover products!
My worst mistake!  This brand came highly recommended to me & I read reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere, but the vacuum that I received doesn't match the reviews by a long shot.  It picks up dust from my hardwood or tile floors, but that is it.  Forget any kind of pet fur, lint, or even small pieces of a leaf or things that come in on our shoes.  It doesn't vacuum anything at all from my area rugs - I cannot even tell that I have tried to vacuum them.  I purchased an additional attachment for carpets thinking that would help, but it didn't.  Unfortunately, I waited too long to try to return this & am now stuck with it. The cord is also very short - I like the retractable feature, but that is really about all that works for me.  I find the disposable bags expensive and they don't hold much.  I will now need to purchase another vacuum cleaner to actually make my rugs look good.  Pass on this one folks!
I do not like this upright  I do not like this upright. TOO HEAVY for the purpose I purchased for. Will NOT stand alone and no way to hang it it closet. I have issue with a part on brush falling off. Cannot recommend. I have tried to get used to this upright but only leads to frustration. I would like to return but my time has expired. I have older Miele canister and it has been an excellent one. Plan to buy new canister type soon.
Item does not last  Be warned - this item does not last.  I used the Hoover once a week for four months and it would no longer turn on.  Hoover customer service was pleasant to work with, but their service centers are useless. My Floormate has been sitting at a service center for 10 weeks and still no update.  Waste of time and money. They promised to send out a new one, which I appreciate, but at this point I've been without my item longer than I've had it.
This vacuum makes a screeching noise and drives me crazy.  I hope it is just a defect and not the actual vacuum.  Also the dirt bin is hard to remove.  I am returning it.
Nice little vacuum...when it works  Having been the happy owner of a DC18 for many years, I opted for the DC24 for our new home since the DC18 is no longer available and I wanted a lightweight vacuum. The DC24 a compact, maneuverable machine with adequate suction for light cleaning and it does a decent job on my rugs...if it's working.  The first DC24 I ordered from Amazon stopped working within a few weeks (the brush bar stopped turning). Having been so satisfied with the DC18, I assumed this was a fluke, sent it back and got another DC24, and that one stopped working after ONE cleaning. I called Dyson and they sent me a replacement head for the vacuum, which fixed the problem--until it stopped working again a few weeks later (same problem, and yes, Dyson, I know how to reset the brush bar and turn it on and off). Customer service offered to send another replacement head. After some more tweaks with customer service on the phone we got the brush bar spinning again, but I explained that I've been able to get it spinning again on my own and then it stops again intermittently when cleaning. Sigh. Now I'm not even getting a replacement head, just the pleasure of calling again the next time it stops working.  That's TWO brand new faulty DC24 machines in less than 3 months, and Dyson won't let me exchange it for another model, even if I pay the price difference. (I'm outside the Amazon return window.)  Anyhow, I might be stuck with a borked vacuum, but that doesn't mean you have to be.  Buy something else.
Avoid at any cost!  We bought this vacuum based on Consumer Affairs report, and were totally disappointed. Not only is it useless on bare floors, it leaves black scuff marks from the wheels. Too many attachments that look good in the store but when you get it home they catch on everything and it is like maneuvering a small tugboat around.  The power cord gets very warm after using it a while, which worries me. This is definitely going back.
Shop Vac - Not a Vacuum Cleaner  Not user friendly, hard to maneuver on carpet, takes a lot of effort to vacuum medium shag carpet. Also not ergo friendly and after vacuuming for 20 minutes hunched over my back hurts and I am only 5'5 so not that i am super tall. Did not notice a huge difference in amount of debris picked up by this cleaner. I actually just order a Shark (going back to what I know works and what I like) and will keep this one as a back up or those really messy jobs that I don't want to use my good (Shark) vacuum cleaner for.
owned 2, both have short term life  This is my second Dirt Devil that continued to break in less than 6 mths. This time the sound is so loud, somthing must be broke and it continues to break parts.
Ok hard to clean out tank
Doesn't work on textured stone floors, or in the molding  Does not get textured stone floors in the cracks or crevasses. There's just not enough pressure on the brushes.
This vacuum cleaner is terrible  I am very disappointed with this vacuum cleaner. I can go over the same part of the carpet multiple times and get the same amount of dust in the canister each time. It is pretty good at picking up pet hair, but the suction is very poor to begin with the does not last long. During cleaning, I have to stop every 5-10 minutes and clean on of the four parts (brush, canister, prefilter, HEPA filter) because it dramatically loses suction if one of these parts is dirty. It is very hard to ensure that multiple components of a vacuum stay clean at all times. I'm replacing this vacuum and I will never buy a Bissell again.
Dyson26 Tipsy  I find the Dyson26 to be too light weight.  It tips over constantly and is not stable.  It needs to be weighted down to stabilize it.  It would be helpful to have some directions re. all the attachments re.their purpose and use.  That said, I do like the small size for small clean-up jobs.
Dont buy it. They don't use stainless steel screws!  It worked good but what person enjoys cleaning the mess that it makes when you turn the damn thing on and it blows rust powder all over the place? Ya, I see how they cut corners and use crap screws that aren't stainless steel.
disappointed  no handle to hold on to when using it and it tips over easy when not using shoulder harness.  I love Oreck products and have used their products alot.  I know they can make a better, easier to use product that is durable. I had the old square on that lasted for many years with no problems; so this was a real disappointment.
And it turned out to be a waste of money  Given all the mixed reviews for vacuums, I decided to give the new competition a try given that Samsung was such a big name in Asia.  And it turned out to be a waste of money.  The plastic piece connecting the adjustable non-flex hose to the power source handle cracked and broke less than a year in (I guess the power brush is too heavy for the flimsy plastic connector).  We patched this up with  duct tape and continued to use this for about 5 months. But last week when I used this vacuum (with the power brush), the hose attachment came off of the duct tape and the wires within the plastic housing also snapped.  I looked on Samsung's website, and it doesn't sell a replacement part for this piece.  And now with broken wires, I guess it's going in the trash unless a repair shop'll want it.  This vacuum lasted just a couple months over one year.  Needless to say I'm staying away from Samsung products now.
Failed in the 3rd use  started leaking in the third use - very disappointed.  Will try to see if the Manufacturer will help fix the issue
Not Worth the Bother  I agree with the other reviewers. The wand constantly separates from the hose while vacuuming. Short of glueing it on I see no other way to keep it in place. Very annoying! Plus, glueing,as other reviewers state defeats the whole purpose of having a canister vacuum. Don't waste your money. It's true that you get what you pay for but if what you have to pay with is all you have you've lost all the way around. I've had two fantastic canister vacuums in my lifetime one was the Electrolux (the old steel model) and a Singer (no longer manufactured) they were great.
Cheap - Dollar store plastic.  There is something wrong when you empty a vacuum cleaner and then have to get out the hand vac to clean up the dirt and dust that flies all over the room.  Relegated to the basement.
The powerhead design has a distinct flaw which let's fur get into an open bearing (ball bearings don't like fur! )  We started out being very impressed with this product, but the longer we've owned it, the less it has proved its worth. We have a golden retriever, so fur is always an issue. It's why we invested $500 in a vacuum. The first powerhead failed, but we'll take responsibility for that because we weren't apparently cleaning the nozzle brush correctly. But after the first one, we've always cleaned everything correctly. Despite that, we're on our 3rd powerhead (at $100 per crack) and had to have the motor replaced shortly before it went out of warranty (not even sure how much that might have cost us, if it hadn't been covered). The powerhead design has a distinct flaw which let's fur get into an open bearing (ball bearings don't like fur!).  The vacuum repair shop assures us that there are much better vacuums than Dyson for animal fur and that Dyson just does a great job of marketing.
Don't believe the reviews... It's a sad, sad vacuum  I wanted to like it. I have hardwoods and a dog and like the cordless idea. I didn't want to have to splurge on a dyson and trusted the reviews. Honestly, the suction is awful. I've tried cleaning it out, I've done everything I can think to do... But yesterday I spilled some cinnamon on the floor and seeing this vacuum leave red trails around the floor instead of making It disappear was the final straw. I'm so bummed I wasted my hard earned money on this model.
broke after 7 months  bare floor pedal broke while it was still under warranty. it's been 2 months and hoover still hasn't sent me my replacement yet. given the research i did i thought i was buying a quality product but i was wrong. this will be my last hoover purchase. disappointing.
Destroys carpet  My wife used this vacuum all over our brand new home (new construction). She used the "High Carpet" setting and it still frayed the tips of the carpeting over several places in the house. If you use the hose attachments, the roller keeps spinning while the vacuum is upright. I have roller-length carpet burns all over my new carpet. I did some testing on a spare piece of carpet we have and the different carpet settings make absolutely no difference whatsoever.  Needless to say I'm very upset, and Bissell was less than helpful on the phone when my wife called. I will be calling them this week to expect a full refund.
The vacuum randomly shuts down.  It worked okay for one year; then it started shutting down, and "bag is full" warning light would be turned on. I had to reset every a few minutes by plugging it off and on again. Now it just shuts off for no reasons every 5 to 10 seconds. This is a piece of junk. I had used Oreck for 10 years and got tired of having to fix it every year, so I bought Hoover this time. I will never buy Hoover again.
wet/dry vacuum  Save your money, does not clean well and does not dry either. Thought it clean better because of the brushes, doesn't do any better then What I all ready have a shark steamer.
Worst Vacuum Ever...  Suction power is very low and the filter has to be cleaned out halfway through vacuuming my apartment, and my apartment is not very large. Very pricey for a large noisemaker that pushes and blows dirt around your carpets. Construction is poor and hard to disconnect the "bagless" container (would probably be better with a bag because you finally get the container open and remove the filter and half the dirt and dust you collected spills out back on your carpet) and get the filter apart and clean. The self cleaning duster is completely useless, as are the hose attachments because the suction power is so weak. I have had $29 Walmart vacuums that work better than this piece of garbage.
Clog King  This is a great vacuum if you don't have anything but dust on the floor.  We have a German Shepherd and thought we found a great vacuum but I cannot vacuum without having to stop and unclog it a few times.  It always clogs in the same place, between the brush and where the hose attaches.  I thought dog hair was a nightmare but needles from the Christmas tree were worse.  I ended up picking up most with just the hose or by hand because I got tire of unclogging it after a pass or two.
WASTE of time and money!  Used on tile floors. Yes - I read and followed all directions.   So *disappointed* in this machine.  Barely puts out liquid even if you squeeze the trigger.  Machine is heavy and time consuming.  The weight wouldn't bother me if it was actually DOING the cleaning.  Don't mistake this for a steam cleaner -- it is NOT.   Basically you have some brushes and some liquid lightly skimming over your floor.  A 5 year old could clean harder than this machine. Again, very disappointed and waste of money.  If there is a free return I will be boxing it up,  otherwise, it's not worth what I would have to pay to ship it.
Piece of garbage. Leave it to the genius 'MENSA' society Engineers to not only DESIGN a product with PLASTIC 'compression type fittings that DO NOT HOLD the wand to the handle, but follow through with production!!  So while you are trying to vacuum, the WAND comes unattached! All for the sake of PROFIT!  No wonder Sear's is going under! I remembered when vacuums would last for YEARS! Now they are made with PLASTIC wheels, that NEVER operate smoothly on the floor, or CRACK, then you have the wand coming unattached! I tried duct tape, that didn't work, then I finally whipped it outside and through it out!  There could not have been any possible product testing on this piece of crap whatsoever!
Very Poor Suction on Bare floors. Dissapointed to say the least.
bad hose  I'll make it short. I bought it to back up my big upright vac.  We did not use it much, we got it for the stairs and quick jobs.   Once the warranty is over, the hose/pipe started to fall apart. I'm using duct-tape to keep the hose, the elbow and the pipe together.  I'm keeping it just because it is still working and I'm out of warranty.
Disappointed  Didn't realize how much I miss my Shark Liftaway.  I bought this because it had good consumer ratings.  This Hoover works good on open floors but I can't get under large furniture that can't be moved- like my entertainment center. The hose that comes with it is average length and the 1.5 ft long attachment is all I can use to get under the furniture or to my ceiling fans. Very disappointed in the lack of attachments and accessories and since it's not a lift away, it's a bitch having to pull and lift the unit every step of the way.  I'm going back to a Shark and using this as a backup unit.
this thing stopped working 2months after i purchased..  The Vacuum arrived on time.  The box looked really damaged, but I accepted anyway.  Opened it up and everything looked okay. The screw that attaches handle to machine was VERY difficult to put in.  Thankfully ,my neighbor was successful after 4 or 5 tries.  This vac no longer has suction....this was my rip-off of the year..
but not in a good way.  bought this to replace the old oreck hand held canister vacuum.  it is different , but not in a good way..the attached  portion of the hose does not stay stretched...and makes it almost impossible to use...
Not made in USA!  I don't know if the vacuum is any good or not, I haven't used it and I am contemplating sending it back as one of the primary reasons I bought it was that it said in the description that it was "Made in the USA"....the outer box clearly said "Made in China", the inner box clearly said "Made in China".....I guess it's made in China!  Amazon, PLEASE CHANGE THE DESCRIPTION!  Amazon changed the Description so at least someone is paying attention to these reviews!!
HOOVER doesn't stand behind warranty if bought from Amazon!!!!  Bought this Hoover in March of 2016 and had only used it about 5 times (had been dealing with cancer treatment so had housekeepers cleaning with their own cleaners) and the motor burned up!  Hoover refused to honor the warranty due to the fact I had bought it from an UNAUTHORIZED DEALER namely AMAZON!!!
Garbage  Stay away from this vacuum cleaner.  After reading all the great reviews I figured I'd give it a try.  It worked great for the first 2 months.  I've gone through 2 belts in 2 uses, one belt was brand new.  It now shreds the belts (which is a very thin piece of plastic - junk) into ribbons, literally.  Wish I'd gone with a Shark.  After spending over $100 and using it for just 3 months, this vacuum is now useless.  Don't waste your time or money on this garbage.
smelt like burning rubber
Ball won't move  I purchased this Dyson in August this year and paid $585 for it.  I hate it as the ball never seemed to roll just right in the beginning but I thought it would get better.  I am a busy executive who commutes into the city of Chicago every day and a single Mom to three teenagers who play travel sports, I have no time.  I have a wonderful housekeeper who was excited about this vacuum when I purchased it and now refuses to use it.  The ball will not make a complete rotation and you have to lift the vacuum to help it to keep moving.  I tried to video so you can see what I am referring to.  I have missed the 90 days to return it, which is my fault, as I said, I simply have no time.  I am seeking a Dyson repair shop.  I have owned Dyson's since I was able to afford buying one and this is the first one I am completely unsatisfied with.  I really just want my money back so I can get a vacuum that I know is going to work.
high price doesn't equal long last  I do like how the vacuum works, I want to be clear on that. The reason it deserves 1 star is because it's expensive and has a reputation that THIS is the vacuum to buy. We thought the price was ok only because it would last a LONG time... well it hasn't even been two years and we have to go through a whole process now to figure out how to fix it. It smells horribly like burning metal as soon as it's turned on... the tube is cleared, filter cleaned and it could still technically be used.  I really wanted to avoid going through these hassles by buying Dyson, well, the reputation is ruined for me for sure.  also to be clear, we use it only once a week, and nothing crazy has ever been vacuumed up, never used outside, all moderate normal use.
Ok for hard woods but terrible on are rugs  Awful vacuum- wish I kept the box to return.  Ok for hard woods but terrible on are rugs.  The floor handle head is very small and cheap. Dont waste your money!
DO NOT BUY  The hose is so stiff it does not bend, so you have  to fight with the canister to move it around. This is definitely the worst vacuum I have ever purchased. I went and purchased the dependable Hoover which I would recommend.
Don't be fooled.....  I bought this based on the reviews here, and I have to tell you, I was very disappointed. Something was not right when my son dropped the box of cocoa powder and it would not pick it up......so, I did some tests....here is what I found. I am not up on vacuum cleaner lingo, so I hope I get the terminology correct, or at least close enough so that I can explain well enough for you to understand.....so, here goes:  As I said, when my son dropped the box and some of the powder fell out, I thought, "perfect, this is a great time to use our brand new vacuum." So, I opened the box, followed the instructions, and guess what, it barely picked up anything. The suction coming from the main head is TERRIBLE. It is very weak. After a little observation, I noticed something else, the bristles seem to move the "dirt" (I will get to this in a second) towards the intake tube (which is off to one side) and does a VERY poor job of picking up anything. Okay, now this is the part that really bothered me. On a carpet, it looked like it did a great job. Picking up what I thought was tons of lint and dirt particles. Well, I noticed something on a light tan carpet that did not show up on the darker ones....the bristles seem to pull up a very thin layer of nap and create its own lint/dirt. I tested this on a runner that is about 3 feet by 2 feet. How much dirt would you expect it to have? After 15 minutes I cleaned out the cylinder and then vacuumed it again. Guess what? Yup, the same thing occured. YET, on that tan carpet I mentioned, all the lint it created that I mentioned, well, it would not pick it up going forward, and only when I pulled it back AND lifted the machine to angle the head did it pick it up. The marketing is brilliant, but, in my opinion, this is NOT a vacuum to use on carpeting of any real value, as I suspect it may destroy them over time. The wand attachment is very awkward, but has great suction. The 3 attachments that fit on the vacuum, fit very well and do not easily come lose when cleaning. There is no place on the vacuum for the two floor cleaning attachments. The "ball" works great to steer/turn the machine, and really, it is a great concept and everything else works great. That is my reason for two stars, and not one. However, for $480 (20% off with coupon at BB&B), the main head of the vacuum should work much better, and more importantly should not cause potential damage to a carpet. I should also note that I removed all the hoses and checked them for any kind of blockage (none present). I should also note that the floor attachments that attach to the wand have great suction, but still, you would quickly become a hunch back if you had to do the majority of your vacuuming that way on carpets. The vacuum is also very loud, but I suspect that is because of the cheap plastic and lack on any kind of sound absorbing material. To all who own this vacuum, take a closer look, and after about half an hour, you will see what I mean. For those considering buying this, I can only say beware. Make sure you have the ability to return it when you discover what I have pointed out. As for recommending something better, sorry, I am still looking, though I am leaning towards a Miele. I will try to update this when I find something worth recommending. Needless to say, I am returning this machine. I hope this helps.
not happy  I like the product. Vacuum has great suction and works well.  What I'm not happy about is Amazon sent me a less than perfect vacuum.  My vacuum was clearly a previous return.  It was repackaged with little care and had multiple scrapes and dings.  I've decided to keep the product simply because it's such a pain to return something of this size.  Thanks Amazon...  you'll not be getting my business again!
Too heavy.  I gave it away!  Leaves lines on plush carpet.
Bad product.  This vacuum backfires dust when turned on. Bad product.
A gift to our nephew.
Bad vacuum  The cord will not stay plugged into any wall sockets. I think it has a bad connection on the end of the plug.
Not like the commercial  I'll admit I was charmed by the beautiful commercials of this vacuum effortlessly picking up everything off the floor. The vacuum's wonderful ball letting you cut close and not have to struggle with the traditional "four wheel" pattern of vacuuming...looks and sounds great. Too bad it doesn't seem to do a very good job. It's great for solid surface floors and the accessory vacuum is awesome! On carpets it will take you a good five/ten minutes per square ft to pick up black sock lint, not to mention, hair, sand, glitter and the myriad of other debris that your family tracks into the house. Taking that kind of time for "the most powerful suction vacuum on the market" is ridiculous! Especially for a vacuum that is so expensive. Don't waste your money, or at least waste it on something else.
Great vacuum...NOT  I rec'd this vacuum 2 days ago and used it immediately after I assembled it (super easy to do). It is much lighter and quieter than my old Bissell for pet hair (can't remember the exact name).  It picked up so much dirt and pet hair that I was actually disgusted that there was that much in my carpet that the old vacuum didn't pick up. The biggest plus about this vacuum - it made my carpet fluffy again!! All the worn down high traffic areas are now standing up again after just one use!  I am super impressed with this vacuum!  3/27/17 Update - I now hate this vacuum.  I completely lost all suction while I was vacuuming the living room (which is now only half vacuumed).  The filters are clean, the roller is clean, the belt looks fine, no clogs.  I rec'd it in early December and have only been using it for about 3 months.  A $90 vacuum that only lasts 3 months is ridiculous!!!
Disappointing  I ordered this canister to replace a Kenmore that I had used for a number of years.  I had heard very positive reviews about Miele and thought I would give this a try.  On first "sweep", it was pretty clear that this unit was not for us.  It seems as though it's designed for quick clean-ups and doesn't hold up to anything other than that.  I had to go over the same area multiple times to effectively clear the usual daily dust.  Needless to say, it was packed and returned and I replaced it with another Kenmore Progressive.
Brush Roll Broke  Vacuumed one room. Brush roll cleaning feature was great and vacuum worked great. Vacuumed second room, brush roll broke. It appeared that one side of the brush roll dropped out of its socket and was melting the plastic that it is made of. Super bummed about it since the brush roll clean feature seemed like a great idea.
Motor is either a lemon has no power but gets the job done ather 5 passes
Garbage.  This little thing is aptly named "The Boss."  Just like my boss, it makes a lot of noise but doesn't actually do anything.  The suction is non-existant.  I can't even pick up crumbs on carpet, and good luck with anything on anything other than carpet.  After one use vacuuming about 500 square feet, the treads and filter were so clogged, it wouldn't clean anything.  I spent 20 minutes digging out all the bits of filth, and started vacuuming again, only to have it get stuck on the carpet when vacuuming in certain directions.  This doesn't clean anythng, it just makes a mess by spreading the dirt around because there isn't enough suction to get the dirt.  The construction of it is cheap garbage.  The light little plastic is so fragile that with normal use, the handle became loose, as the handle is made of two pieces, they started to rattle around when used.  The lock to keep the handle up doesn't work particularly well, and the lack of any sort of locking position for the vacuum makes it painfully annoying to use.  It won't lock upright and it won't lock if you lower it downward, so you cannot lift the vacuum over a bump of from hardwood to carpet without picking the entire vacuum up.  I wish you were allowed to give 0 stars.
Too heavy and doesn't move well.  I do not like this product. It's very heavy and not enough suction in my opinion. Hope I can return without the box. My husband threw it away.
Did not last very long  This vacuum was ok for about a year, with little use, but after the brushes got very dirty we tried to take it apart to clean it and it was impossible to put back together in working order. If you do buy this vacuum beware that you should never try to unscrew the bottom panel and get inside to the brushes and belt because the vacuum will be forever broken and useless.
I bought this in September 2016 and the brush (dowel) broke in January. Secondly, I called Bissell and they said that this part is not under warranty. So they make a part that totally lousy and then there is no warranty. The only thing they gave me was free shipping on a new brush (dowel). Do not buy this product. IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK!! CUSTOMER SERVICE IS LOUSY!! BEWARE!
It is very difficult to move it around  What were Hoover engineer/designer thinking when it comes to ergonomic design.  I will give F- for ergo design.  It is really difficult to take this vacuum cleaner up or down on stairs.  I wish they had an holder at middle part of body to lift and take it to stairs like other model: Hoover Tempo Widepath Upright Vacuum.
Utter Disaster of a Vacuum Cleaner  I bought the Eureka Altima from Target as a stop-gap while saving pennies for a Dyson and it turned out to be an utter disaster. Seemed fine for about the first hour, and then quickly began spewing out as much dust and dirt as it picked up.  So I broke it down and cleaned out the filters. Here-in lies the main problem with the Eureka Altima; it's got three filters in three separate compartments that all have to be cleaned out separately. This includes a small, round plastic filter that is impossible to see, hard to get to, and frequently gets clogged. I'd clean out all the filters, resuming vacuuming, only to have the Eureka Altima start spewing out dirt fifteen minutes later. I spent more time cleaning the filters than actually vacuuming. And even when the filters were perfectly clean the vacuum would still spew dirt, leaving the vacuum itself covered in a dusty grim and the floors a less than desired level of cleanliness.  This vacuum also eats belts like fat people eat McDonalds. Eureka includes a replacement belt with the Altima with good reason. The first belt last a week and the second lasted three days.  Ultimately I returned the Eureka Altima and exchanged it for a Dirt Devil Vibe (same price) which has a single filter system, doesn't eat belts, and doesn't spew dust in the air.
I hate this vacuum cleaner For dyson I am so disappointed  I hate this vacuum cleaner For dyson I am so disappointed.  Can't even finish vacuuming it's clogged
Buyer Beware  I read the bad reviews, but ignored them in favor of all the positive.  I bought this vacuum less than 3 months ago, and it has totally stopped working.  When it works its amazing, and picks up a ton of dust & pet hair.  It looks great, and has really good attachment.  The body is very cheaply made, and is very fragile.  I only used the product 10 times, and it started to randomly shut down.  It started doing it more often, and now dosent work.  I wouldnt order this product again.
FUALTY VACUMM  I purchased this vacuum with a 3 year warranty I have had it a month have not revived any thing on my warranty . It has just stopped working in the middle of using will not turn back on and now having no response from amozon or the seller after several messages. I have been on the phone for 2 days with black & decker transferred from dept. to dept. no on seems to handle this vacuum and now waiting on a call back from another dept. this product and black & decker is the worst out there and the service SUCKS  I am now going to file a complaint with the attorney generals office over black & decker DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
After six month the brush on this vacuum cleaner stopped working, it appears as if a belt is broken but there is absolutely no way to have access to it.  This vacuum cleaner is an expensive piece of junk might as well go with a cheap Kenmore. DO NOT BUY
Not for hard floors  I have a dog, 2 cats, small kids and mostly hardwoods and area rugs.  I bought this vacuum based on Consumer Reports high rating for my needs.  The self propelled function works great in the one room with wall to wall carpet, but on the tile and hard woods, the vacuum is careening out of control. It sounds like a screeching race car and then bumps hard into my furniture and molding along the walls.  It already has numerous scratch and scuff marks and we just can't control it well.  I switched from a 10 year old Oreck and was used to holding the baby while I vacuumed so she wouldn't be afraid of the noise.  This one is so ridiculously loud, I think the neighbors can tell I'm vacuuming.  The pet hair attachment works well, but the powerful suction sucks the short hose even shorter so you have to really use some muscle to get it to the couch.  The suction is great on the vacuum in general.  I also don't really appreciate the clean and dirty lights because the "dirty" light remains on even on a brand new area rug.  Noise and steering are the biggest reasons that I would not recommend this vacuum and I'm buying a different one after only 6 months.
The worst I have seen  The hepa filter stopped working in less then a month, looses suction quickly because it cloggs, a mess too dump the bagless canister, there is nothing I can say "good" about this vacuum.  I hate it.
Air Deluxe Lift: Don't lift it off the shelf...pick another vacuum  I love Hoover Air line but this one model, I've hated the most.  After two months of ownership, this vacuum does not have long enough tubing that is attached from machine and that you would use to do extended vacuuming chores with the use of other attachments: the whole vacuum just tumbles and falls down. It happens so much that you have to lift off the canister to do anything really. And then, do you want to carry a canister to do all your vacuuming. I typically love cleaning my home but this thing just is so stupidly engineered, top heavy, and the tubing is not long enough (the other Air models have extended flexible tubing and light enough that the machine stays standing).  There is also too much heated air blowing from below the canister area in the last couple of weeks, which has coincided with suction loss from the floor/carpet mode. There is just barely any suction intake from the bottom of this machine when vacuuming my floors. So weak, it wouldn't even pick up a popcorn kernel!  Hoover, why???? This is a horrible machine.  I was tolerant of the other Air models that suddenly had the tubes detach and I had to secure them myself...but those operated beautifully.  The only mode where suction is the best is when you don't use it for the floor but just the hose/tube itself. I love the smaller pet tool as it helps me pick up the dog hair off the furniture. But that's all this vacuum has going for it.  This Air Lift Deluxe is just horrendous. I really regret buying this Deluxe model and should have stuck with the basic Air model, which is perfectly light, does not tip over, and let's me do everything I need.  By the way, I replace my Air models about every 2 years. Sadly, this Deluxe Lift is not even surviving 3 months!!! Highly disappointed. And I consider myself loyal to the Hoover Air line.
OK, if you want it as a DIY project  For the price, the vacuum does a solid job. We used this vacuum mostly on a big area rug and hardwood floors. We spent most of the time vacuuming dog hair from our lab/husky mix who sheds like there is no tomorrow. I do have to say though, that 4-8 weeks into using it, I had to replace the belt. Luckily, I had an extra belt from an older model Eureka vacuum. (I then ended up replacing the belt one more time 5 months later)  Emptying and cleaning was an average process. If you did not put it back together correctly after cleaning, the vacuum wouldn't work correctly. You would think that everything was put back on fine, so there should be more guidance as to how to properly put the canister and filter back together.  After one year, I am sad to say, the vacuum now does not turn on. I  have spent way too much time fixing this thing from replacing 2 belts, cleaning stuck hair from the motor, to a broken wheel. I suggest spending a little more to not have to deal with all of these hassles.
Junk
I consider this a poor product and poor customer service  Item is  not working properly and Amazon will not allow me to return the item since it is over 30 days "as per policy."  How can a product not work after just 30 dasy?! There must be some kind of flexibility to allow a consumer to return if there is a defect. I consider this a poor product and poor customer service.
Don't waste your money  By far the WORST vacuum I've ever purchased. It simply does not pick up! And on another note, it's absurd how short the cord is for a vacuum.
Had to return the item... pieces missing.
This was my second Dyson vacuum cleaner. The first generation cleaners was so much better. This one I ended selling it for 25 % of the cost at a garage sale one year later, that is how bad it did its job. We had to vacuum 6-7 times the same area so it can pick up small crumbles from the hardwood floor. So disappointed. We purchased a Shark Navigator , it was so much cheaper and it vacuums 10X better than this Dyson.
I wouldn't buy it again  Doesn't brush carpet like expected. Feel too light, cheap.
Kirby is the worst vacuum that I have ever owned  Kirby is the worst vacuum that I have ever owned.  The sales people are very pushy, but they are also very good salesmen.  The salesperson shows you how your old vacuum leaves dirt behind after several passes over one spot and then how well the Kirby picks up the dirt left behind.  It was very impressive.  After owning it for a while and seeing what it leaves behind makes me sick.  I have two large dogs that shed a lot, the Kirby does not pick up the dog hair.  I can make another dog with all the hair that I had to use my shop vac to pick up, after using a rake on my carpet, and that was just one room.  If there is a small piece of fuzz on the carpet, the Kirby will just push it around, the only way it gets picked up is if I reach down and get it.  Bags are very expensive.  If I had read the reviews, that Kirby would not live at my house.  I now have it posted as a yard sale item, if I ever find the "right person" to buy it, my next purchase will be a Shark.
Not recommended!  I was very excited when I ordered my Dirt Devil Platinum Force Carpet Extractor. And I am always amazed how fast amazon.com is able to ship things! But when it arrived the Dirt Devil Carpet Cleaner was broken, the motor did not work. I reported my problem that night and Amazon had UPS pick up the cleaner at my door the very next morning, with no cost to me. Within just days a new Dirt Devil arrived at my door as a replacement. So I happily started cleaning - but unfortunately this cleaner lasted only 4 minutes (!) , then the suction motor broke down, I was so very disappointed. I really wanted a carpet cleaner because I have 2 dogs and I really appreciate Amazon's costumer service. I decided to give it another try and ordered the "Hoover F7425-900 SteamVac V2 with SpinScrub Hand Tool" from amazon.com. It is a little more expensive but the difference to the Dirt Devil is huge! It seems so much stronger build and has done a really, really good job on my carpet! And it is not expensive to buy an extended warranty for the Hoover, so even Dirt Devil offers the 2 year warranty it is not worth its money. I now always prefer Amazon to any other seller as their costumer service is just the best. But I do not recommend the Dirt Devil CE7900 to anyone.
Disturbingly disappointed.  The day purchased the Savvy, I was so ecstatic--it did a wonderful job. Then I tried the turbo-paw & upholstery attachment, there was NO suction. Same was true for the edger. Hoover said, probably needed repair--after 1 use??!! (Parts under short time warranty, not labor!).  Decided, OK, get a supplement vac for these projects for less cost.  Kept filters cleaned etc, and watched for pet hair etc around roller. On the 3rd use--lost all suction. Checked, cleaned all systems AGAIN. Turned back on, and smell of bad circuit, then smoke!  My last vacuum lasted 20 years, w/belt change now & then. The one before that had been in the family since the 1950's.  Hoover really doesn't back this product! I could have paid someone else to vacuum my house 10 times, instead of purchasing this product that didn't last thru 3 uses!
Didn't last long.  I purchased this item a little more than a year ago. It recently started smelling hot and then started losing suction. The warranty had just expired, of course, so my husband pulled it completely apart and to no avail. There's no clog, all the filters are clean and it hadn't been used very much. Also, even if it did work well, I wouldn't purchase if I had to do over again - it doesn't maneuver easily and the cord is far too short.
Really disappointed  I researched vacuums pretty heavily before choosing this one to replace our dying Dyson.  One of the plastic power cord holders snapped off when I was removing it from the box.  Then every time I ran over a piece of cellophane plastic (our dog loves to chew it up when he find it) I had to stop the vacuum and remove the plastic from various places in the suction mechanism.  Finally got tired of having to clear the mechanism and decided to take it to a repair place to be cleaned out then sell it.  My wife was so pissed at the vacuum that she put it in the garbage before I could take it to be repaired.  Only had it 3 months.  Back to Dyson.
Not all what Consumer Reports said  When the vacuum arrived the belt to drive the brush worked intermitently to not at all right out of the box.  I took it to a local warranty shop (to avoid the re-packaging hassle)and they had to bend a plastice piece that controlled the belt tension.  They said it happens often on this model.  Their advice was buy local, I now believe that.
this is NOT a quiet machine nor does it stand up to regular use.
I hate it  Within a week, it needed to be taken apart because the hoses were clogged. After about 4 months, the suction was very poor, and it had to be taken apart to clear the hoses before each use (I am not talking about emptying the canister and cleaning the filter - I did this before each use anyway)  Now, after 6 months of use, it is going back to the store (under extended warranty) It does not work at all, only blows dust and dirt around.
Vacuum Broke Within Six Months  I purchased the Hoover Cannister Windtunnel in August 1010. It provided good suction power and since I have two cats, I was happy with the amount of hair it sucked in the bagless machine.  I was surprised with how much hair it sucked compared to my previous cleaner, a Kenmore.  However in February 2011, six month after my purchase the machine stopped working.  It turned out that the electrical wire had lost its connection with the machine. I had to pay $83.00 to repair it.
Not an Easy Sweeper to Use  Terrible sweeper in terms of being lightweight and easy to handle on shag carpets.  First of all, the handle keeps retracting or sliding down, especially when using on shag carpets. It breaks your back. The suction is so strong, not on the highest setting,that it is so difficult to push or move it forward. Also, when switching to use the hose for cleaning shades, etc., there is not enough hose to each high window blinds.
Missing attachments.  The product is good and powerful but when I received the Vacuum cleaner it had missing attachments in it (Crevice tool missing). I'll be returning this item now.
Tall Tree  We returned this vaccum.  The hose is too long and will not stay in it's place.  It flops all over while you're vaccuming.  (Had to wind it around the front of the machine to keep it from coming undone.) The attachments fall out of their places as well, so you are always fiddling with them and the hose.  The cord gets tangled up with the hose and attachments, so that's another thing you have to stop and fix<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Eureka-4870MZ-Boss-Smart-Vac-Upright-HEPA-Vacuum-Cleaner/dp/B0015ASJIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Eureka 4870MZ Boss Smart-Vac Upright HEPA Vacuum Cleaner</a>.  It seemed to pick up well, but all the adjusting and fiddling negated that.  NOT a user friendly item.
Loved it for the 1 year that I got out of it, did a wonderful job cleaning the floors. It stopped working properly after a year of usage, it stopped spraying when you would push the trigger. I had a friend that had the same model and she also said hers stopped working after a year also.
Used it 7 times and it died!
DON'T DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This is the worst Vacuum cleaner I have ever owned! Do NOT buy! I purchased this cleaner November 12, 2014, it is now March 18, 2015 and the cleaner is not working! Three months is an unbelievable time frame for a vacuum that was gently used to stop picking up anything, the only thing that works is the suction hose. I really was hoping to like this cleaner but from the very first time I used it something was not right. Very jerky movement & power attachment broke during first use. It is very heavy & cumbersome too. I order everything through Amazon but I will not be ordering large items again through them and I will never buy another Hoover. Once bitten, twice hell no! I am investing in a Miele but I won't buy it from Amazon (who I usually love) because if I had bought this from a local store, I would have returned it from the start. If you are reading this review, don't buy it! I am so careful before purchasing an item (always check consumer reports, etc.) this is to date my biggest mistaken purchase. I paid $139.00 and only got to use this Hoover Windtunnel Anniversary edition for 3 months. I guess Hoover celebrates Anniversaries by ripping people off! Amazon should stop offering this item, so many complaints.
Returning Vacuum : broken powerhead  Great vacuum... my wife and I loved it.  Read all the reviews and still decided to purchase one.  Suction was great and it worked well in our house... it does seem a little cheap with lots of small plastic parts... but then again they all do and this looked like the best one of the bunch.  However after using it today for about the sixth time the powerhead motor went on the fritz... stopped working all together and went to the manual to see what the heck was happening.  Apparently there is a thermal switch which was activated so I waited until it cooled and cleaned out all the hair in the meantime (we have no pets).  Now it works intermittently and when running stutters.  I'm very sad to give it up since we enjoyed it when working and I'm not looking forward to weeks of combing reviews on other models.  Update:  During the process of writing this review the powerhead had more of a chance to cool down and seems to be running better.  Sometimes it will just stop and need to be coaxed into starting again.  I'd like to get at least five years out of this vac but now I'm not sure what to do.  I'm a little surprised no one else had a problem like this or if the did... didn't write about it.  I'm going to give it another week to see how it works out and possible contact Hoover.  Try to get back here to update.  (10/14) And.... Finally returned it.  Had too... The main motor starting burning up and stunk up the entire house with the smell of a melting motor.  Total let down and I'm unhappy to say the least.  Thankfully Target took it back  Now my house is in desperate need of a cleaning and I have no idea what to buy.  Great...
Your Product and it stopped working help me and change it back  "I brought your product and it stopped working,help me and renew it"
Not a good vacuum. Died after 8 months of use  Not a good vacuum.  Died after 8 months of use.
Skip this one  Ended up returning as it just didn't have enough suction power to get the dog hair off hardwood floors.
Disappointed  Based upon on all the positive reviews I was very excited to get my new Hoover windtunnel max. I am hoping that I got one that was defective, but unfortunately it did not work well. We do have pets and sweep about every other day. Just by sweeping one room the 3 channels of suction quickly filled with hair and there was no easy way of clearing the channels out. Also every time I pulled the sweeper backwards something made a horrible squeaking noise. After several times over the same area I could still see hair on the carpet. Needless to say UPS is coming today to send it back and the return process on amazon has been so easy so far. Hoover was a local company for so long and I was really hoping that this would be a better sweeper.
Do Not Buy This Vacumm Cleaner!  We have been highly disappointed with this vacuum cleaner.  The direct drive is simply too powerful for the plastic agitators.  After a couple weeks of use, the plastic agitators become "stripped" and do not turn.  We have owned for three months and have already replaced the agitators once and they need to be replaced again.  My wife hates the vacuum cleaner and we are going to try to get Hoover to swap it out for another model.
No Thanks!  I purchased a Dyson dc33 16 months ago.  When I used it on my Berber carpet the clutch made a horrible bringing noise.  The noise is so loud you won't use the vacuum. The rug beater bar stopped working altogether after a year.  I purchased a new clutch and installed it.  It would make the same grinding noise so I didn't use it much.  Now the beater bar won't run at all again.  I called Dyson support and they told me that the Berber carpet is causing so much suction that the clutch kicks in.  They told me not to use it on Berber.  When I bought it, it said it was for multi floors.  What a bunch on BS.  This is an expensive vacuum and it can't do carpet.  Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.  Dyson offered my 20% off a new canister vacuum.  No thank you!
Pos  Went thru 2 brush assembly's in 6 months at 30 bucks ea
Finally the streaks are gone. Poor build quality.  I love the concept. The stuff brushes don't get very deep into grout and textured tile because the machine is lightweight and the bristles skip across the high ridges of the tile but the soft bristles do great.  We have dark floors and have fought streaks for years because other hard surface cleaners just push gunk around picking up some of it in cloths, mops or sponges but this actually removes the gunk and no film or streaks. I only wish it would incorporate steam cleaning. We love our steam mop but wish it had better pickup like this floor mate. Other con is it has like a six second delay from when you pull the trigger and the water actually comes out which is rather annoying. The only drawback is the build quality. After a few months I had to replace the water valve. Now a couple years later the valve is toast again. The motor also is rusting out and it is shedding rust debris everywhere. I'm going to look for something with better design using more galvanized and stainless parts. I'm willing to spend more for durability. Even the screws in the water tanks and cleaning head are rusting because they are not stainless. This was great for the short time it lasted.
Loud and difficult to clean  We've had this vacuum now for a couple of years and it's a pretty bad unit. The suction is good, but the decibels are unpleasantly high and the filter is difficult and messy to clean. The filter issue is the bigger problem, as one can always wear ear protection for the sound. But the filters are so difficult to clean that it frankly defeats the purpose of not using a bag in the first place. They hold very fine dust which packs with the other larger particles, hair and so on, to clog the filter. When cleaning, not only does it take a long time but you breathe in plenty of that fine dust.  It could be fair to say that my objection is more to this whole class of vacuums - cheap, loud, and bagless - that to this particular model.
the worst vacumn - has stopped sucking - only 3 months -
Don't recommend.  Worked well for a couple of years with really light use.  The Vacuum stopped working after that. Took it to a factory authorized service center and was told that it is a service issue and not covered under warranty. I was asked to pay up $60 for service plus cost of parts  if needed. Better to buy a new one. Do not recommend this product. Stay away.
Each use, weakins it.  I received this Vac as a room hand-me-down; the previous owner used it for less than a year. I only have an area rug 6 by 4 feet to vac, which I vac once a week. The five times that I have used it, it has become increasingly more difficult, and has less powered than the previous. It is very loud and takes me 30 min to vac a small area. I have a Bissell upright at my house, and that's lasted me 2 years, still sucking up the smallest of dust particles.
The newest ones no longer re-engage back to carpet, horrible new design Eureka!  So this is the 4th vacuum like this I have bought and I have absolutely loved them all except for this  latest one I just bought in December 2015.  They have changed the vacuum and now when you are vacuuming carpet and stand it up to move something, pick up something, take a break, etc... it no longer engages again back to carpet, you literally have to bend all the way over and press the tab from bare floors back to carpet, every single time!.  All 3 of my previous ones (I had loved them so much I gave one to my daughter and one to my son, and I kept one for upstairs), stop spinning the brush when you stand it up and then it starts spinning again to continued vacuuming when you resume.  But this model makes you have to stoop all the way down and have to press the button back hard to start the brushes to carpet again.  It's the stupidest thing ever.   And I called Eureka before I returned it to make sure I wasn't getting defective ones and they said that's how they do it now!  They tried to tell me it was a safety feature to stop the brushes and I told them that was SO much bull because I've had 3 others over the last 9 years that have always stopped when you placed it upright and then it simply resumes.  They had to admit it was a horrible new design and they would report it to development?  Meanwhile they have ruined their reputation and they need to look up the bad reviews about this on Amazon.  Or simply ask women who vacuum A LOT (I have several cats and two large German Shepherds that shed horribly) if this was a good idea before they did this!  If you use this to vacuum bare floors then this won't bother you, but this is mainly a vacuum for carpet!    You can tell I'm really disappointed that after all these years and 4 of these that I have to start researching and find another that I will like as much as I have like these over the years because nothing before sucked up stuff as strong as this and I love love bagged vacuums because I cannot stand to have dust in the air with bagless, I hate them.  The attachments are so convenient!  People who complain about the hose stretching out over time are correct, but what they must not seem to realize is that when it does, just start placing it through the top loop in the handle and then down, it works and holds it perfectly.  Oh well, the re-engaging is a huge deal breaker for me since I vacuum carpet 99% of the time and cannot stand constantly bending all the way down to the floor and pressing that hard button to start vacuuming again.  And since I have the 3 that stop and start again, it makes me more upset they changed this.  UPDATE: I was on the last day to send it back (it would be the 2nd one I was going to send back) because I can NOT stand having to bend down to switch to carpet every single time, So for one last time I tried to see if I could make it do what my others had done (roller brush stops when standing up and then starts again when you start vacuuming). I started flipping that brush roll/bare floors switch back and forth a 1000 times over and over really quick thinking I might can just break it and make it stay on carpet , LOL. And guess what ! I didn't break it, but it now will stop when I stand it up and will start back to vacuuming carpets again when I let the handle down! But ONLY 50% of time, but still way better than every single time.
Perhaps i got a dud?  I have two cats and a semi-allergic husband, so i needed a vacuum to perform better than my old Kenmore.  I did lots of research and went with the Consumer Reports pick, this Eureka Boss Smart-Vac.  Performance-wise, I'm very happy with it.  However, it's very heavy, bulky and not very easy to use. First of all, the knobs and settings are near rediculous!  The button to step on to unlock it requires hard-soled shoes or you can bruise your foot-very hard to push!  The lever to switch from carpet to bare floors cannot be switched unless the vacuum is in the locked position and then it is often very hard to do.  There are three position knobs/dials you need to always be aware of to ensure correct setting.  If you were vacuuming the bare floors then used the attachment, then go to carpet, you have to remember to switch the top knob to 'floors', then the height to an appropriate one (not bare), and then the switch from carpet to bare. Second, it is very heavy.  i usually have to have my husband carry it between floors for me (especially back when i was pregnant) because it is so heavy and big, I'm afraid i'll fall with it. Third, and most disappointing...the belt breaks CONSTANTLY!  I've got to change the belt after every 3-4 uses!  The last time i went to buy belts I went to 4 different stores to find them!  I would think this is a popular brand (it was flying off the shelves at Lowe's when i originally bought it a year or so ago), but Target didn't have them, Home Depot didn't have them, Sears didn't have them...I had to go to a ma + pop vacuum shop to buy them and they were $10 each!  I just found them here on Amazon, so now i'm stocking up.  I took it in before the warrenty came up to have it looked at, but they didn't fix it.  Kind-of a long story, but basically I took it there to complain that the belt was always breaking and that the motor seemed to get really hot and stinky when i ran it for more than about 10 minutes at a time.  The guy took it apart and verified the belt was in tact, then put it back together.  a couple days later they called my husband and told him it was okay, the belt just needed to be replaced.  My husband went to pick it up before he told me what happened.  At the time i was about 6 mths pregnant and didn't feel like bothering with it. So now i'm left with a crappy vacuum that eats $10 belts like candy. Anyway, it does a good job of cleaning up cat hair....when the belt isn't broken!
This is a terrible vacuum. Don't buy it and put your money towards just about anything else.
Maybe it is me, but can't get this to work very well.  I ordered this a few weeks ago, and was excited to try it out as a replacement to a steamer.  The reviews looked good, and the sales video looked good.  Putting it together was easy, but it went downhill from there.  Figuring out the amount/timing/etc. of spraying the liquid seemed more difficult than it should be.  It seemed I had two options - soak the floor to the point of near-standing water (this was being used exclusively on tile), or only give enough liquid for the brushes to partially clean.  Given Hoover's reputation and the ratings of the product, I assumed something was wrong or defective and requested a replacement.  The replacement arrived quickly, and the exchange was handled very easily.  I tried out the new unit, which seemed to work a bit better, but I still found similar issues...it was tough to get water to come out going forward, but every time I pulled it back towards me, there was a ton of water where it stopped.  The brushes never got the right amount of liquid to really clean, yet there was water everywhere - too much for the unit to suck back up.  I read the instructions, watched the video, and still couldn't find the problem.  Most of the other reviews are great, and I had had the same issue on 2 units, so, perhaps something is wrong with me.  Though, I have been able to successfully use vacuums, steamers, etc. in the past, so I am just not sure what is going on...
I don't think I can dislike it more  This to me is a back breaker. You have to constantly change settings. Tools, Floors, carpets, bare, brush roll on or off.  It takes more time to vacuum then it ever did. Attachments keep falling off and cord could be longer. It gets hard to push. Only thing good is the suction and its easy to empty canister. I was very disappointed. Have had it 3 months and will look forward to replacing it. I think this is the first time I ever wrote a bad review but also first time in years I purchased a new vacuum. Maybe they are all made this way now?
All for want of a screw  Didn't get a chance to try it out, as the screw holding the bottom to the handle didn't go through to the other side.  Had to package the whole thing up and am waiting for the carrier to pick it up and return it.  What a shame!  Somebody sure failed QA on this one!
Does not replace hand scrubbing, so why bother?  I purchased this hoping that with the brush scrubbing action, it would scour my floors clean.  I was terribly disappointed.  I don't think it did any better than a Swiffer WetJet in that department.  The FloorMate was too loud, the cord too short, the juice too expensive, the dirty water tank too small, and the performance unacceptable considering the price.  We returned ours and purchased the Bissell steam mop instead, which works extremely well for frequent cleaning.
Inferior plastic housing.  In my opinion these used to be the best canister vacuum's, but something has changed with the plastic housing on the new ones, we've had two break apart in the last year and that's just with common use. It's like the heat is making the plastic brittle. I'm changing to a different brand this time because of it.
I thought it was just a random problem when my first vacuum broke and I really liked it so I just bought a new replacement  Bought in December and it is broken by July.  This was a replacement for an identical Hoover that broke.  I thought it was just a random problem when my first vacuum broke and I really liked it so I just bought a new replacement.  Wish I didn't because this one didn't even last as long as the first. Bottom line:  It works really well...until it doesn't.
Worse vacuum  I would give this vacuum zero stars if I could.  I just spent 30 minutes to get the 5 screws out to change the belt that broke after only 2weeks of use.  I'm frustrated with grease all over my hands from changing the belt.  I returned my first one because the belt broke several times in a short period of time.  I stupidly brought a second (thought the first was a lemon); I will be returning this one as well.
I do not normally write reviews for products. However, I have made an exception for this particular slice of hell.  The canister broke the second time I used the release to empty it. The cord winding mechanism never worked properly. It's as if it was assembled hastily by an underpaid manufacturing worker that hates their job. Then, it was inspected by a miserable QA representative that has given up on life and just gave this machine the rubber stamp because it was "within spec." Finally, it arrived at my door to be a continuing disappointment for a grand total of 10 months before simply failing to power on at all anymore.  Just spend your money on literally anything else.
Only buy if you plan on it being a disposable product in a few months!!  Had this vacuum for about five months. It did a decent job initially of picking up cat hair. I am a senior citizen and wanted something light weight and good for carpeting. Like other reviews I have just read, wish I had read them earlier, it now works fine with the hand held hose only. Used in the upright position it doesn't pick up anything. So it is essentially useless. It was a pure waste of money unless you plan on it only lasting about four months.
The Shark MV3010  Don't use the steam feature on your hard wood floors. The pad has plastic scrubbie pads on it. Why I don't know? The pad should be 100% cotton. It left streaks and scratchs on my hardwood floor.
5 Stars for Amazon return policy  Not very happy with this machine compared to the Electrolux upright it was supposed to replace.  We had the good fortune to have bought this from Amazon and were very happy with the return policy.  Note: Replace the HEPA filter in your older machine!
Disappointing  I would not recommend this vacuum. The dirt cup did not snap together and overall it seemed flimsy and could fall apart easily.
Flimsy. Small. Weak.  This is just not a very powerful vacuum. Maybe it would work if you're a single person in a small apartment. But Ive got three kids and two Siberian huskies, and this thing is just not up to the task. The cord is short, the canister is small, the suction is weak, the attachments are useless. I expect to have to replace it by spring.
This probably needs more sterilization very light but not very stable the section off the vacuum cleaner it's not that good I would not order this product again you better off with buying more expensive product instead
I liked it while it was working but  I liked it while it was working but,... This is the second one I've had. The company replaced the first one since the batter life was so awful. Lasted just over a year then wouldn't recharge. Same issue with this one. Expect about a years battery life. No more!
worked perfectly for about 2 months  I bought this vacuum right before moving out of my apartment, and it worked perfectly. Up until about a week ago I had no problems with it at all and was happy with my purchase.  Then suddenly the vacuum won't pick up cat litter and other things off my floor. I tried emptying and cleaning everything, and yet I still get so much stuff just pushed around my floor instead of being sucked up. Not bad for a ~$50 vacuum, but I wish it was more durable over time.
No good
DO NOT get for carpets  It doesn't work on carpet/rugs - you have to go over the same spot about 10-20 times just to get it to pick up dog fur.  Works great on tile / hard flooring to get crumbs and dust.
TV ad  was impressive, product was not.  I was very disappointed with the lack of good suction, the ad on TV was impressive the product was not. I would give 5 stars for the ease of returning and how promptly the correct amount was credited to my credit card.
Wake up Hoover  After reading some of the previous reviews, I am glad to hear that I am not the only one who has had more than one of these FloorMates that has died after only a few uses. My 3rd unit just died today after having received it from Hoover this past January (2017) The on/off switch or the motor just dies. As long as it is under the 1 yr warranty Hoover will  replace it, but it's such an inconvenience. When the machine works, it works pretty well.
It will break down on you soon.  Just wouldn't turn on one day. Maybe used 10 times.
We returned this because the hose gets clogged very easily! too many sharp turns in the hose!!
was not impressed.  The battery life was pathetic and the cleaning power was even worse. Not impressed at all and would not recommend to anyone.
Can't Recommend This  While I love the results from this carpet cleaner, I have two problems that prevent me from recommending its purchase: (1) I have replaced one part (which costs $70) twice now -- and have used the cleaner that many times; and (2) the Owner's Manual contains an inconsistency that could prevent you from ever rinsing your carpet.  A latch on the dirty water collection lid is defective.  It broke off the first time I used the machine.  Thinking that the latch had broken due to my clumsiness when rinsing the lid in my bathtub, I ordered a replacement part from the Hoover website -- and paid the $70.  But the part arrived with the same latch cracked off (probably dropped in shipping).  When I contacted Hoover about the problem, they sent a replacement but did not otherwise acknowledge the problem or offer a $70 refund.  Today, the replacement lid (my third) arrived with a crack in exactly the same place.  Because the latch is not broken through, I will use the cracked part and hope for the best.  But I do not see this cleaner lasting more than a few uses.  Once the current lid breaks, I'll replace the cleaner altogether -- a shame.  Also, the Owner's Manual tells you to "hold solution trigger while pushing machine straight forward.  This is the wash cycle.  Continue to depress solution trigger and pull cleaner towards you.  This is the rinse cycle."  But the illustration (Fig. 4.1) would have you release the trigger when you pull the cleaner towards you.  If you followed the illustration, you would vacuum the cleaning solution without rinsing.
I had an older floormate which was great. I will be looking for another older version  I purchased this machine today and am taking it back.  It is the cheapest made machine and does not clean. I had an older floormate which was great. I will be looking for another older version.
Cheap and bad product  Cheap product, gears of the electric motor that spins brushes, are made from a cheap plastic and wear away easily, no more scrubbing motion.
brush doesn't work  The vacuum  works but the rolling brush from the beginning only worked on occasion.  At this point it doesn't work at all.  I bought this because I wanted a rolling brush for my karastan carpets.  I've followed directions and cleaned the brush but it still does not work at all.  Hoover had a good reputation and I wanted to use something lighter than my Kirby.  No luck.  This brush will not work even off carpet.  People need to be told they have a nonworking machine!
It's okay for small spaces. Does not work well on tile floors with grout, or on floors that are even the slightest uneven. It does clean floors with 3 or 4 goes on the same small area though. Not a good match for our home as we have tile throughout the whole house. I do believe it would work on linoleum or other types of flooring that have no gaps. Hope it worked better for others.
Won't hold up.  There's no doubt that this vacuum has great suction power, picking up massive amounts of dog fur.  Unfortunately, after only one week, I have to return it because: 1. The dog hair it picked up is IMPOSSIBLE to empty from the chamber without reaching in with my hand or a stick. 2. The belt already broke.  Granted, it comes with one extra belt, but I have to wonder how long that will last if the first one lasted only one week.
Dyson Cheaped Out  Having owned a "non-ball" Dyson animal for years that worked great, we decided to get the "new" animal ball vacuum, the DC40. It is the epitome of a company making it big by making great products, then looking for ways to get richer by making the product more cheaply (without reducing the price). The cord is 10 FEET shorter than my original dyson, so I'm constantly unplugging and replugging. And they made the bin about 20% SMALLER!!! Ironically, if you have pets, you shouldn't buy this 'animal' vacuum. I vacuum almost every day, and have short haired dogs, so my floors do not have the big rolling tumbleweeds of dog hair that my long-haired dog friends have. Just a layer of hairs that need to be kept up with. And in order to vacuum my first floor I have to empty the bin at least 3 times.  All Dyson vacuums are plastic, so they definitely start cracking and breaking down after a few years, but this one feels EXTRA CHEAP, all the way around. When you snap it into the upright position, it sometimes doesn't snap just right and when you let go it falls down. I feel like I'm working A LOT harder to use this vacuum.  I purchased at Costco, and after several months, I'm returning it. I saw someone else doing the same the other day. I hope if Costco gets enough of them returned they will demand better from their supplier.  I feel ripped off by a company I had previously trusted and respected
Overall a Rip Off  Belt broke almost immediately. Very difficult to replace and reassemble. Brush clogs constantly. Extremely over priced. You can do a lot better than this at half the price.
Wouldn't Purchase Again. Emits Super Loud, High-Pitched Whine and is Unusable After Only 3 Months.  Edit: July 2015 // The vacuum is now completely broken and does not turn on after four months of normal use.  ----------------------------------------------  At first we loved this vacuum cleaner. It has good suction and made short work of the dog hair left around the house by our two large breed dogs. Then about 1 month in it start emitting a high pitched squeal, which was fixed with WD-40. I thought we were in the clear but now, two months later, the vacuum emits a super loud, high pitched whine the seems to be coming from inside the vacuum. It's so loud that it's not just irritating, it hurts your ears. As in, it's so painful we can't even use the vacuum. Haven't been able to figure out how to fix it this time but even if we did figure it out, this is a pretty bad track record for a vacuum only 3 months old.
Piece of junk  I am terribly disappointed with this vacuum and am returning it tomorrow.  I had 2 Kenmore canister vacuums previously and they were good workhorses.  This model is a piece of junk.  The suction is fantastic, but..... the handle and hose detach from each other for no apparent reason,  there is a terrible smell that comes from the body of the vacuum when using it, and it is very noisy.  I would NOT recommend buying it.
Do not buy Hoover!!!  Do not ever buy a Hoover vacuum!!! Vacuum not even 2 years old, still under warranty and the motor went out but Hoover will not pay to have it repaired at an authorized dealer that they sent us to go.... Never buying Hoover again!!!
PIECE OF JUNK!!!  This vacuum gets so hot after running for just a couple of minutes that it smells and smoke starts comming out of the filter area.  I have two young children so it takes more than a couple on minutes to vacuum.  Another thing I can't stand is the darn thing is always clogged and has to be taken apart. The cord drags on the floor and getts tangled.  I always thought that Dirt Devil was such a great brand but I think I will be trying something else.  I am afraid that this thing is going to start a fire the next time I use it.  If you are thinking of buying this vacuum, don't spend your money on something better.
This definitely has good suction.  Once a year or two I buy a cheap vacuum.  I have a large dog and I find even the expensive vacuums will stink before long so I just buy cheap and replace.  I'm really confused at the reviews that rant and rave about this Eureka. I question if they are even legitimate.  This definitely has good suction. .. but that's it.  It's beyond cheaply made.  Reminds me of a child's toy.  The cord is too short as in plan to unplug for every room.  The canister is tiny.  Even in my 1900 Sq ft home I dump every room or two. This would be great for a broke college student living in a tiny dorm.  If that's not you, I suggest spending an extra $20 for a Bissel from Walmart. 10x the vacuum at almost the same cost.  I should have driven to the city instead of taking a chance on the Eureka.
Poor for the Price... Keep Looking....  Completely broken does not work anymore after about 5 months of use did not work very good even when it was working. poor product for the price. Do Not Purchase.
Wanted to like this vacuum  After all the hype, I was hoping to like this vacuum. Alas, after sending the first one back for replacement because it kept clogging up in places I couldn't get to, the second one is even worse. The front lights stopped working in a couple of months and I'm afraid the engine will burn out from all the times it's running but not working.  It is also awkward and heavy and hurts my back. Nice idea.  Needs to go back to the drawing board. After all my reading of reviews and deciding on this vac, I am back to square one.
Loses Suction... Don't Waste Your Money  Taken into the repair shop twice already because unit loses suction.  Dyson customer service run-around.  Filed complaint with BBB asking for refund or replacement with different model.  Still no luck... Still stuck with a Dyson that won't suck.
Would not recommend.  You get what you pay for. Stopped working suddenly this morning. Only had product for a year and a half. Was not impressive for the time I used it either. Would not recommend.
Really disappointed  There is now way that this vacuum cleaner was re-conditioned. It sounded like it was sucking up nuts and bolts, and the red light (trouble) came on. I already had it fixed. I had it for a day, and was afraid to use it. It is better now, and seem to be doing o.k. I love this Dyson. It wasn't the product, it was the fact that it wasn't re-conditioned.
... and heavy for me my age is 79 i like to change to a smaller  i just had a knee replacement i find that this vacuum is to strong and heavy for me my age is 79 i like to change to a smaller vacuum
Ok for doing open areas of carpet, other than that, not so good.  Purchased Dyson DC upright model a few years back  its ok for doing open areas of carpet.  As for doing floors or furniture, corners, close to walls, furniture, under bed area, emptying, its a complete hassle. Here are some significant drawbacks we found: 1. When I have to change over to the furniture attachments etc., I often can't remember exactly how to disassemble the hose contraption from the unit because you have to reconfigure it in order to vacuum directly from the hose attachments, because 2.  Although the hose stretches, it only stretches so far -  only 1 or 2 feet before it starts to pull on and move the unit, you really need 3 hands for this.  [Once finished, you have to reattach and put all back together/reassemble the hose unit, and 9/10 times I do it wrong \ where the handle goes because it always looks backwards so this frustrates me. So if you're not sufficiently coordinated or good with puzzles like me, and have a bad shoulder/arm it's frustrating and time consuming going back and forth from hose to upright vacuuming. I usually like to do both but now I do all my hose vacuuming first, then go back to the same rooms and do the upright floor/carpet vacuuming afterwards] 3. The cord length is ok, because there's no retractable cord feature like the canisters, you do have to wrap it all around the hooks on the handle (which is better than the canister type model, it's definitely a plus to have to manually wrap the cord if you favour or prefer cord length, since Dyson severely sacrifices length for retraction feature). 4. Also although the unit has "ball" technology, you still need a lot of arm, shoulder and wrist action, so if you have issues with that, I'd stick to a straight model vacuum. It is not really that much easier to vacuum around coffee tables or under the bed and barely even beside the bed and such because the head on the unit is so big and tall/high, you cannot go under furniture lower to the ground, before it bumps into the bed or 2-tier end/coffee tables, you get about only 1-2" inches at most of vacuumed space under/around those kinds of areas. 5. Suction is good for normal dirt and light crumbs etc. although still have to go over area a few times to pick up, unless canister is completely empty, it gets less and less the fuller it is. Will eventually pick up pet hair or lint but must go over and over area several times, and even then ...meh. Also does not like to pick up larger pieces such as popcorn kernels and anything that size, have to either go over and over it, or just bend over, pick it up and put it in the garbage manually. 6.  Emptying the dirt from the canister is a chore, MUST be done into a garbage bag outside as it is very fine dirt/dust and a cloud forms. That only gets the majority of dirt from centre but if you want to remove all the fine dirt that remains inside the canister you have to keep tapping it on the ground to loosen and remove the remaining fine dust, also making sure the wind isn't blowing in your direction. Not easily done in the cold & snow in long winter months. I could not return the vacuum because the store I bought it from no longer exists here, and so I gave it away to our son. I'm disappointed and do not recommend it in context with the very high price, and believe me, many people ask how we like it. Ive had better for cheaper. It's hard to believe realistic trials were performed as these issues would quickly be discovered and hopefully resolved. I think there's other vacuums out there with just as good suction only better more effectively functioning features, hoses, cords, manoeuvrability, etc. etc. Is the cyclone technology great? sure, but that's about it. So I just wish the rest of the vacuum had as much thought put into it. Overall score 3/10 - for overall vacuum experience Rating Summary: For suction: 6/10 - a lot of vacuums have that For versatility: 3/10 good for straight large area carpet vacuuming only (not including along walls/corners, furniture, bare floors). For length of electrical cord: 5/10. Emptying dirt canister: 3/10. Overall score 3/10 - for overall vacuum experience
My vacuum stopped working Feb 2017 purchased Oct  2016
Great when it worked  It was great when it worked.  It worked for *maybe* a year, not long enough to justify the cost.  I bought it to clean our hard wood floors while we were teaching our child to eat.  Now, despite cleaning the machine itself and my husband carefully going over all of the seals, it does not pull the water back up off of the floor, even when on the dry function.  I just tried to clean up a large section of floor and had not a drop of water in the collection canister when I was done, no matter what I did.
Belt keeps slipping off the motor.  This vacuum worked great for 7 MONTHS. The belt keeps coming off of the motor, making it unable to pick up dirt. We've had to take into a vacuum repair shop twice and it keeps breaking. It seems to be a manufacturing error.
high maintainance, heavy, low suction for the price.  My first problem with this product is its 24-cyclone part (located at the top of the machine). When you want to clean it you have to wash it. The problem is that you cannot use the machine if that part is wet and it does not dry for days once you wash it. The reason is that it is so tightly built the water left inside evaporates very very slowly. Basically, this is a high maintainance machine. It says on its ad "Advanced cyclonic no loss of suction technology". Well, I am willing to trade this technology with emptying the dust cup more frequently if it requires that much maintainance.  Second, it is very heavy. I do not mind it but my girlfriend really hate to use it and everytime she complains about it.  Third, I don't think that its suction  is very good, especially for this price.
Not for floors with ANY texture  Very disappointed in this product.  If you have completely smooth tiles it will work beautifully.  However, my slate look porcelain is not at all clean. The dirt gets stuck in the ridges and the only way to get it out is on your knees with an old-fashioned scrub brush.  I also purchased the brush supposedly designed for tile and grout. It made absolutely no difference.  Back to my hands and knees.
Good option for a higher end vacuum at a better price point  From the side, this vacuum looks similar to a vehicle from the latest Tron. The wheels are rounded and futuristic looking. The brush head is wider than the body of the vacuum, so while it has a slim profile for the body, it still takes up a fair amount of storage space. Some assembly is required out of the box - I had some difficulty getting the hose to attach internally, but eventually got it.  Pros: * Hose is transparent gray, meaning users can see if something is stuck inside * Easy to dump and dispose of the vacuumed detritus * Hose reach extends further than similar models * Filter is easy to remove and clean; dries overnight * Easy transition from a carpet to hardwood with a button located on the handle. Other models have it located above the brush and it must be moved when the vacuum is not in operation. * Carpet got really clean. This is a 3 cat household, and I steam every 2 months after vacuuming. I usually end up needing to rinse out the brushes for the steamer, as additional hair gets released from the carpet. I was able to steam the entire house without needing to do that after using the Samsung.  Neutral: * Moderately heavy: while lighter than a Dyson, it's also heavier than the current Bissel * Volume level is about average of a high performing bagless vacuum  Cons: * Not many handheld attachments for pets, stairs, or furniture cleaning. Some similar units have those attachments. There is another Samsung model exactly like this one that offers the additional attachments, so be aware if those are of need. * Not self-winding cord - the electric cord must be wound around the handle. Having a retractable cord is a nice feature that is not offered in this model.  Samsung appears to have entered the higher end vacuum pool with a solid contender at a good price.  EDIT, 5/2 2015: Unfortunately, the spinner brush has stopped working and none of the fixes tried have been successful. It's only been in use for about 2 months, so this is disappointing. The suction still works ok, so it's fine for hardwood floors, or using the wand, but it's now useless on the carpet, which is 70% of my house. Dropped the rating from 4 star to 2. It's too expensive a model to break after such a short time.
Not holding up  I bought this vacuum in December, 2015. After four months, it seems the belt is melting and spraying a fine layer of rubber on the clear plastic brush cover. It has also started making a very loud sucking noise which I can stop by tilting it forward and then pressing the handle release quickly.  I really liked it at first, but it's not holding up well at all and I would like a repair or refund.
Don't waste your money  Overheated and would shut off. Would have to sit for quite awhile before it would turn on again.
It broke!  Not worth it at any price....  After a few uses, the beater bar started to make an incredibly loud sound which is supposed to mean the bar needs to be cleaned.  Even after cleaning, we always have maybe five minutes of vacuuming until it makes that sound and shuts down again....  It works only if we use the bare floor setting without the beater bar....  Not worth it at any price....
Keep Looking - This Is Not The Vacuum You Seek - Or - Make Sure To Keep Your Receipt  (Review by Mrs. Ricci).....  Have had this model for 2 months now, purchased at Boscov's for $199.00. I bought this one based on reviews and because it seemed better made than other models in the store.  Although the suction is excellent it is a horrible machine that is difficult to maneuver and has already stopped functioning in some capacities.  It is very heavy and has a large footprint - it does very badly in corner and smaller areas. Even the self-propelled function only helps a little; it's like dancing with a refrigerator.  The hose is thick and does not expand very well (but may soften with time). I can only get about 3 feet from the machine which impedes movement and hampers cleaning ability.  The power-roller brush is not working and the Clean/Dirty indicator light is stuck on. Based on a search to solve these problems.... clearing the dirty/clean light OR trying to get the power brush to work again involves taking the vac apart to clean.  A $200 machine should not need this kind of attention after a dozen uses - I'm cleaning up after a dog and a cat, not farm animals.  This vacuum WILL suck up socks, small area rugs, pet hair, crumbs, etc., but the problems with it are not worth the suction power.  I don't think I have the receipt anymore but am going to call Boscov's to see if they'll take it back, anyway.
Don't fall for the British accent commercials  Don't waste your money! You can buy a vacuum cleaner for much less money that is just as good. Actually, I found a Shark Rotator is easier to maneuver and has just as good suction. There are very similar models. Dyson has over-priced products to cover their costs for very shrewd marketing. Don't be duped!
No Power Beater Bar  We have a Dyson canister and needed a second one for a second room.  I ordered on from Amazon and upon opening found that it lacked a power beater. I had to pay $20 to return it (does not seem right) and am not happy with Dyson or Amazon!  The 2009 Dyson canister came with a power beater bar but this one does not even thought it costs more.  I end-up purchasing a LG - Kompressor PetCare Plus and am very happy with it.
Disappointed.  I had several of these in the past. All of them lasted more than two years of heavy use. This one is a piece of junk. Got it July 10. The plastic around the wheel cracked and therefore, the suction power sucks (no pun intended). I fixed it with tape, but the plastic keeps cracking. I do not know if this one is made in another country, but is obvious that the quality is really bad. Very dissapointed. Would not buy again. And You shouldn't .
To much money  I have used the Dyson for a year and it is not all that it is cracked up to be. The suction is good but;;; the appliance wand is a joke. You can remove it about 1/2 the time the rest it just refuses to come out of the machine. The furniture head is not up to par with other machines at 1/2 the price. One maker's furniture head has a suction driven beater which really works. The cord is about 6 feet to short compared to other makes and it has no light for dark hallways. Definitely overpriced.
Worked well for about a year then stopped rolling.
The 30 day return policy ended a week ago and now it has no suction. I've tried everything I can think of and cleaned out everything. I've never been so dissatisfied with a product from Amazon. Oh. And forget the one year limited warranty.
Hate It  I bought this after my DC14 went after having it for 8 years and using it a lot. That model I loved. This new model I absolutely hate. The canister is so small and I have to take the whole thing apart just to empty it. The ball is actually bigger than the canister and it does not maneuver as easily as one would think. The expandable wand cannot be used without an attachment and again is not as easy to use. I'm very disappointed with Dyson this time and will be looking to return this vacuum and go with one that got better ratings.
Ordered this 6 months ago and I'm already looking for a replacement. It doesn't pick up anything. Definitely not worth it.
do not buy if you have long hair pets  The vacum brush is very hard to clean dog hair off it. It has groves cut around the roler where hair can rap around it and makes it to hard to cut the hair off the roler. It is just a big pain.
Terrible product, falls apart all the time.
Poorly designed Vacuum with multiple issues.  Where do I start. This has to be one of the worst vacuums I ever had a chance to use. To add to this I have to say that Hoover customer service is also un acceptable. As others have said, this vacuum gets stuck to bare floor on most settings making it useless. Dragging it across a rug on a high setting picks up nothing and on any other setting it cannot be pushed. This vacuum lacks the little roller wheels around the pickup opening on the brushroll area which in my opinion is a huge design flaw. It does not allow for a break in suction.  The handle is flimsy, it wobbles and is very uncomfortable.  The roller assembly broke on the 3rd use.  About the only good thing about this vacuum is the long cord. This is useless when the unit itself is a complete failure.  Hoover Customer service only gave me a run around with one only option to drop it off at a service center and completely ignored my complaints from the moment I contacted them. They did not even address my issues.  Bottom line is poor design with no support that equals bad product.
Hose way too short!  I bought the new Kenmore because I have an older one and love it  (probably 15 years old and still working fine). I thought I better buy a new one to replace it  and move the older one downstairs. I am disappointed in the new one! As other reviews have mentioned, the most irritating thing about it is the hose! It is way too short and basically useless!  The older model has a really long hose! I have cleaning OCD and vacuum A LOT and I have animals in the house and I NEED a hose that is practical!  The new vacuum is going to the basement and I'm bringing the older model back upstairs! I have always had good luck with Kenmore brand but I am not happy with this vacuum!
Zinged out in cloud of black smoke  this thing died in a cloud of black smoke after just a few months of light use. I put it in the garbage and moved on to a better product.
Awful filter needs cleaning constantly and is impossible to clean  This vacuum cleaner is not expensive because you get what you pay for. The first week I had it I was happy with its performance, but thereafter I realized it is an awfully made product. Way too often, it stops picking up on my carpet. I check the filter regularly and it is so covered in dust and impossible to clean. I used a wet toothbrush, but it can't get between the tiny compartments that hold dust and dirt. I have a small apartment and this should not require constant cleaning. I used toothpicks, but it takes so long to clean it well. I think this is ridiculous and wonder how this product was approved for sale. I am not one to have buyers remorse, but I have to tell you, I wish I'd just paid more for a better product! The aggravation and poor performance leaves me to believe, you get what you pay for.
Buyer beware of Amazon Deals  Supposedly all of the merchandise on Amazon Warehouse Deals is tested and is in working condition before it leaves the warehouse, however, this is not the case. As soon as I plugged in the vacuum it was clearly apparent why the previous owner sent this vacuum back. The motorized brush roll continuously keeps turning off and on; making it impossible to vacuum. As I assessed the handle I found it doesn't look durable, so perhaps the electric contacts that power the brush head can easily be damaged.  This is the second time I get no deal from Amazon Warehouse Deals. The last time was with a broken power supply for a broadband modem.  Anyhow, Amazon did refund my purchase price and issued a prepaid return shipping label. I then ordered the Electrolux Nimble with Brushroll Technology, which is a better overall unit.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Electrolux-Nimble-Brushroll-Clean-Bagless-Upright-Vacuum/dp/B00BMRJH7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Electrolux Nimble Brushroll Clean, Bagless Upright Vacuum,</a>
Cannot Recommend  I cannot recommend this product. If the dirt or debris is RIGHT UNDER the vacuum it will pick it up fine. But anything to the side gets blown by the exhaust, causing one to have to chase the dirt around in a rather unfun game of catch-me-if-you-can. Also it blows the dirt out behind the vacuum, so I'm often feeling my feet being hit with dirt. The other not-so-charming feature of this product is that after you empty the dust container and snap it back onto the vacuum, when you turn the vacuum back on, it blows a giant dust cloud out. I think these can all be attributed to design flaws.
DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY  This vaccum just works for  a month or 2. After that all parts come off. suction gone, belt broke, its a piece of rock. complete waste of money
Stripped Cord and Safety Concerns  Terrible vacuum and even worse customer service.  Within a couple weeks after we bought this, the cheap plastic clasp on the canister broke.  We were able to still use it but basically the lid of the canister became totally separate instead of hinged which was annoying.  Then we noticed that due to the rewind feature, the cord became totally stripped exposing the electric wires.  Fortunately, my husband noticed this before my two year old grabbed the cord.  There's a number on the vacuum for Hoover's warranty which we called and were told by some call center employee that we had to take it to an authorized dealer / service center so they could determine whether it was a covered warranty item.  Of course, the closest one was an hour away.  When we did get the vacuum to this service center they said they would have to keep it for two days while they worked with Hoover to determine if it was a warranty item.  Long story short, Hoover would not cover the damage.  The service center rep (an independent business - not Hoover) was actually very nice and reasonable and thought it was crazy that Hoover wouldn't cover the cord reel and agreed it was a safety concern.  Needless to say, we'll just go buy a new vacuum and it will not be a Hoover!
Missing parts  Missing filter and missing screw that holds vacuum together
Impossible to purchase extra upper tank filters  I have owned this vacuum for over a year and have had frequent problems with it,  within 2 months the plastic release pedal which drops the vacuum from upright to vacuum mode broke,  this took about 2 months and 2 different Bissell repair shops to get repaired.  I have tried repeatedly to purchase extra filters for the upper tank since it clogs up so quickly and was told today that they are unavailable and to try making my own using foam!  The vacuum is out of commission as long as this filter is drying and if you use heat to dry it faster it will fuse the filtering components and become ineffective,  the belt just broke on my vacuum and it is difficult to remove the bottom of the vacuum to replace it once you manage to find one to purchase.  This vacuum seems to be out of service and unavailable to me to clean my home at least 50% of the time!  Really unhappy with this product.
Save Your Money -- A Mop Works Better  Save your money. You are much better off with an old-fashioned bucket and mop. I bought a new FloorMate less than four months ago. Even when it was brand new, performance was marginal at best. The brushes failed to touch the tile floor, so it was necessary to carry around a separate scrub brush. You still have to use a vacuum cleaner separately, because the FloorMate clogs with hair. Today, after not using it for over a month, I tore apart my condo to clean the floors. When I tried to use the FloorMate, it would not dispense clean water solution, even after pressing the two buttons repeatedly. I phoned Hoover's customer service number and got a recording. So, I left my call back number. Meanwhile, I grabbed my old reliable rope mop and bucket from the garage, completed my chore, and put the furniture back. Several hours later, Hoover returned my call. But by that time, I had already made arrangements to return this piece of junk to the merchant who sold it to me. This was for store credit, because the return period had just expired. Not only does the mop do a better job of cleaning the floor, it fits around the toilets and other places where the FloorMate cannot fit.
Not good quality, feel like I wasted $130 on junk  Only lasted 4 months before it started over heating and turning off. Then the bottom to put cord in broke! Not good quality, feel like I wasted $130 on junk...
a disappointment  When this works it's great - but as of this morning it no longer works and I will have to find a repair person/s to find out why the motor seized up.  I have only had this machine for 6 months  - it was purchased new through Amazon
FALLING APART  This "machine" is poorly designed and not built to last. The screws are coming out of the handle (I've had to replace with ever larger ones - a losing proposition). The suction is great but makes it very difficult to push across carpet. This is the worst product I've bought on Amazon. If anybody wants one, keep a lookout from my back door. It'll be there soon for the taking. DO NOT BUY!!
It shuts off after 10 minutes of use.  After letting it sit for a while you can turn it back on.  ????????
Broke down the first two weeks(Agitator carpet brush stopped rotating and vac was useless. ) However  Very heavy for use by very fit Senior citizens and those in the Advanced Age Category. Extremely cumbersome to use (without proper handles to grip). Just plain difficult to maneuver.  Broke down the first two weeks(Agitator carpet brush stopped rotating and vac was useless.) However, good suction; cleaned carpets very well. Dont buy....Youll hate the maneuverability and reliability of this vac.
Disappointed.  Cleans great. Literally can't vacuum even dust off the floor. If you want to be able to use it to dry clean the floor before wet cleaning it, it's absolutely useless. If you want to use it solely for wet cleaning, it does this very well. Takes practice to get used to using it. I would have returned it, but before we could get it out of the box, the return window had expired.
Powerful, but loud, smelly, and usually broken  I will never buy another Hoover again. This is a powerful and easy to use machine that cleans deeply, but I have to take it apart regularly to clear hair out of it. If you have hair, and most of us do, it binds up in the brush bearings, causing them to melt their housings and the brushes and making an unbearable burned hair/plastic stench. I have replaced the brushes once, and lubricate the bearings frequently. When picking up a small rubber band caused the gear drive for the brushes to melt and sieze, that was the end. I disassembled it to try to repair it, but seeing the extent of the damage, dumped the whole thing in the trash. Anyone else would have thrown it away in the first year. Hoover makes dozens of models of vac, with every conceivable kind of gadget, but they should make at least one that works well.
Great for floors  If you are looking for a vacuum cleaner that is lightweight and good for carpets, don't buy this one.  I was looking for a vacuum to be able to use for the stairs and under my bed and this has no brushes to clean carpets.  It looks like it is made strictly for floors.  It does have great suction and is pretty light, but I wish it was made more for carpets than floors.
Some good, Some Bad  Well I love the suction, and the power upholstery attachment, however there are a number of serious design flaws. The worst flaw is the hose, it is very cheap and stiff, although it can theoretically swivel on both ends, you will have to twist it with your hands for it to do so. The hose comes out of the canister at a nearly vertical angle so there is not enough sideways force to make it swivel even if they did have a half way decent swivel attachment. The result is that the hose is constantly kinking and every time you move a few feet the canister flips upside down. Adding to the flipability of the vacuum are the two large wheels on the sides that prevent the canister from turning easily. Rotating wheels would have been a big help here. I have a 1980's Hover canister that has never flipped. If I could buy an old Hover I would.   My next disappointment was the swiveling arm, which by the way swivels like a dream, so I know they can make a good swivel (try putting it on the hose). I thought I would like this feature however I have found that it makes turning the power head very difficult. When I push the arm to the side instead of moving the head to the side it just swivels the arm. To actually change the direction of the head I have to pick it up turn it and put it back down again (this can get very tiring). Additionally since the hose is kinked all the time, it puts sideways pressure on the arm as a result I am constantly fighting to keep the arm vertical.  On last flaw regards how attachments attach to the arm. The power attachments have a very loose connection and will come off with just a little pressure. When vacuuming under the couch I have pulled the arm back out and found that the power attachment was left behind.
Disappointed in what appears to be a lemon.  My old upright  Miele has performed extremely well for four years, but recently began sounding funny.  Two months ago, decided to purchase a new Miele U1 upright and top of the line canister - C3.  As well as the old upright has performed, the two new Mieles have performed diametrically the opposite.  Am astonished, given all the rave reviews, as well as Consumer Reports' review.  I've checked everything, but a part of me thinks I may be missing something.  I find the C3 clunky, difficult to maneuver, and it performs like the $89 vacuum I had many years ago.  I expected much more for $1K+.  Disappointed is an understatement.  Is it possible that in the normal course of business,  Miele and other manufacturers, make lemons?  Review for U1 will be similar.
I wanted to wait to review until I used it so I am stuck with it & will not use it. This machine left streaks & dull areas. The contact with the floor was poor even though my floor is very level & very new Morningstar strand bamboo. It didn't dry the floor. It is clumsy to handle &  the 13lbs. feels heavier probably due to the design. The ONLY thing I liked was seeing some dirty water being collected but the TV commercials give a false depiction of how much water is sucked up :-( You have to go soooooooooo slowly to get any result!  I am very disappointed & if someone will give me $20 it's theirs!
Not as good as the old Hoover vacuums  My vacuum was under a year old when the motor burned out.  Hoover said they would repair it under warranty. After taking it into the specified repair shop (ran by Oreck) it took over 3 months for the 'part' to come in.  Now I can vacuum for less than 5 minutes before the over heating sensor shuts off my vacuum.  Sad that the quality of the company has decreased to this.  I ran a Hoover canister vacuum for over 10 years.  I would think twice before buying this model again.
Dont buy this junk!  I received this on January 10 of this year.  Today is January 31, it stopped today.  Just completely stopped.  What a piece of junk.  Please don't waste your money.  I didn't even want to give it a star but had to to get this review to go through.
Horrible thing  Lost suction the second time i used it, cleaning the vacuum cleaner needs to be done about every 5 minutes because it thinks (!) it's clogged. There is almost nothing in there, how could there be something in it to clean as it has not sucked up anything.  The hose is clean, and even when it is completely empty it has no suction at all.  Takes more time to deal with this horrible thing than clean the whole house. We have hardwood floors in the house and some carpet, does not work on both floors at all. I have it now for about a month and next wednesday it will be where it belongs: the garbage dump station.
Died after little use in less than 2 years  Before it died it did an ok job but it's way too expensive to die after so little use and less than 2 years.  Everything is built to crap out these days so I'm going to buy a cheapy next time since it will probably last as long as this one and cost 1/6th the price.
Absolute Junk!  The first one I ordered arrived not only damaged (cracked base) but also had a faulty power button.  After the hassle or repackaging and returning it I received a replacement.  The replacement also had a faulty power button and did not work AT ALL.  I read the instruction booklet cover to cover and even called the toll free number for Hoover to ask if I was possibly doing something wrong or was unaware of some start up procedure.  Well I can say do not waste your time (38 minutes in my case) trying to contact Hoover!  They are among the most unhelpful customer service people I have experienced.  Next, I requested a call from Amazon customer service.  They prepared a return for full credit and were most helpful.  However this Hoover FloorMate is Junk.  I am two for two in receiving an inoperable piece of cheap plastic.  I will look for a brand other than Hoover in the future.
Had this vacuum 9 months works perfect then one day out of no where breaks and won't turn on. Not happy.
385 days from opening box to trashing it  I bought this on 11/11/2012  after reading reviews.  I won't say it sucks because that would be a good thing for vacuum cleaners.  At first I liked the way it swiveled for getting under furniture and close to baseboards.  After a few uses I began hating the feature since it made the unit VERY difficult to steer.  The retractable cord sounds good on paper but is very sensitive and forcefully retracts whenever it darn well feels like it.  The toe-lever that is supposed to switch between beater-bar-on and beater-bar-off broke within the first month.  Since we only used it on carpet, I "fixed" it by wedging it in place (beater-bar-on) with a cardboard shim.  In the 385 days I've owned it, I've had to dismantle it three times to unclog a right-angle air flow path design in the base - a definite design flaw.  We have no kids, no pets and live in a clean low dust area. The unit was definitely not being used in a challenging environment.  The final blow was that we bought new carpet -- slightly higher fiber than our old carpet.  The unit apparently has no mechanism (automatic or manual) to adjust for carpet density type (only "carpet" or "bare floor").  With our new carpet using this vacuum was like pushing a plow through thick mud.  No thanks.  Life is too short.  Yes, it looks good on paper but my wife brought home a new vacuum from a local store today. .....just in time to save me from a fourth dismantling and unclogging.  The first time I had the clogging problem I had taken it to a distant repair depot complaining of a short circuit.  It would power off after some initial use.  After being in the shop a couple week, the repair depot told me this was a "design feature" to keep the motor from burning out in the event of a clogged air flow.  Although I later found a statement in the manual which hinted at that, it was anything but clear and prominent.  Moreover, the repair depot said they wouldn't unclog it for me under warranty.  It would cost me quite a bit out of pocket.
i wanted to love this - i waited a long time to buy a Dyson, but I've had it less than a year and it broke already. It still runs, but nothing sucks up into the canister. So frustrating! The warranty was over, but Awesome Amazon still let me return for the majority of my $ back, which I really appreciate.
Good for small cleaning jobs and hardwood floors.  I found this to be much too flimsy and lightweight, if it's to be used as your main vacuum cleaner. It is good for small vacuuming jobs and hardwood floors.
Was a solid vacuum but only lasted one year. It is now weak and doesn't have any suction.
Great vacuum - cheap parts on it however.  UPDATE:  This is a piece of junk.  Spend a little more and get a SHARK brand vacuum.  Works well in a "dog house" occupied by one guy and one Chocolate lab and his fur shed.  Tile and low pile carpet  - works well on both. Only complaint so far is that after two weeks one of the two little rollers on the base of the rotating brush came off.  Only held in place by plastic formed "Bracket" that will easily crack and break from obciously minimal use.  I believe a new base plate can be purchased - but stronger plastic castings are required for an area of the bottom of the vacuum that obviously takes some hits as being rolled over hard tile and likely being banged around a bit from being placed down on the tile in a less than "soft touch" manner.  Also, the tools attached to the back of the machine are continually falling off - a bit of a Mickey Mouse design.  UPDATE:  After 4 months of use -- the entire suction motor stopped working.  Beater bar still rotates - but absolutely no suction as the motor is obviously fried.  Call Hoover Customer service - very kindly refer me to the nearest service centre for repair which is over 1 hour away.  Each way.  Once to pick up and once to drop off.  No - we won't send you a replacement one (as other owners seem to have been able to get) - explanation being "We're just a call center".  Translation:  The service line is there to give you the phone number of the nearest repair facility.  Very helpful.  So - thankfully the product only cost around $80 on a special Amazon Prime sale.  Like much of todays products - completely disposable after a few months of work.  Back to my equally well priced Shark brand that I owned before this purchase - and which lasted for 3 years and was still working at the time I upgraded to this Hoover.
This is the worst vacuum cleaner we have ever purchased  My wife bought this based on consumer reports recommendation.  What a crock of you know what.  With the power head on you can only turn it to the right.  What idiot would design something like this.  Would you buy a car that only turned to the right???  There is also some cheap c-clip thing that holds the power head on.  This clip is always getting knocked off and lost and then you are without the power head until you go online and find new ones-- (good luck finding them-- when you do you better bookmark the web site cause you'll need more later).  I just had to order 3 more at $5 each!!  Stay far, far away from this vacuum cleaner.
Dead after 5 months  UPDATE: 3/5/2017 After only 5 months of VERY light use (we vacuum, at most, once every 2 weeks, and we don't have that much carpeting, only about 150 square feet that we vacuumed regularly) this piece of junk has died. It would run for a little bit, then the engine would just give up and die. After that no amount of unplugging and replugging it in, switching it on/off would change anything. I had to rest for about 12 hours before it would start again. Put up with that for a month while cleaning it and trying to get it working again, to no avail. Nothing helped. AVOID this brand! ---------------------------------------------- ORIGINAL REVIEW: Sept. 2016  I have been testing this for several weeks, it works all right. It assembles easily, but it is also easy to THINK you have it assembled correctly, but NOT have it assembled correctly, most especially the placement of the hose so it provides suction properly to the whole system.  PROS: -light -has pulled a LOT of dirt out of my carpets -good price -nice standard features (easy to raise, lower; easy to use hand tools, etc.) -easy to empty -includes a HEPA filter  CONS: -Finicky assembly -Easy to assemble it wrong  Bottom line, for the cost, it is going to hard to find a much better vacuum cleaner  4 stars.
Performance should equal price  I'm a handyman by trade and I work in middle to upper class neighborhoods because that is where the money is.  And on many of my jobs, though I use drop cloths, I finish up with vacuum cleaners to add that appearance of a job well done.  And after 15 years on the job, and after using countless, Hoover's, Oreck's, Electrolux's, Eureka's, Dirt Devils, Bissell's, and the insanely over priced Dyson; my opinion is this: vacuum cleaners should be rated by their ability to suck in direct proportion to their purchasing price.  The more you spend, the more it should suck.  That's common sense right?  You buy a vacuum to suck right?  So why not get a vacuum that is the best in that area?  And for that reason compared to some other vacuum cleaners, Dyson is a terrible buy.  Moreover, the next feature that should be mentioned is the method used to contain that which a vacuum vacuums, which is primarily dust, hair, cockroaches, and a few socks here and there (joking).  And still, even to this day, the best method at containing dust you will find - is in a "bagged" vacuum cleaner. Look it up!  In addition, "noise" could be a major factor but you will have to sacrifice some (little) suction to achieve your goal of less noise.  And from my experience, the drag around canister type vacuums are quieter because they are built to be quieter.  I liked the Bissell and the Hoover Wind Tunnel though I couldn't tell you model numbers.  But both are "bagged" vacuums.  Furthermore, weight should be a factor but that is a personal choice.  I haven't used a newer model vacuum where weight was the biggest issue.  Those old school solid aluminum vacs were heavy but they've been phased out of existence.  Not only that, they don't perform like today's vacs.  Hence, out of the entire above mentioned list of vacuums, Dyson is by no means at the top of this list.  It's on the bottom with the other upright bagless vacuums when it should not be.  And that is simply because it is the most expensive (insanely over priced) vacuum cleaner that I ever came across.  The vacuum cleaner I own is the one I purchased for approx $200 on sale at Sears.  It can almost suck chrome off a trailer hitch, LOL.  It's the steadfast, reliable, bagged, HEPA filtered, upright H_____.
Good while it lasted  Good while it lasted.  I wouldn't say great, but it got the floor pretty clean with no bending down.  I couldn't get right up to the edges of things.  Water stopped coming out for some reason.  I used it maybe 20 times.  I purchased this to save me time.  I am a pretty handy guy, but I am not interested in fixing it.  Disappointed in the quality.
Pure Garbage!  My wife bought it years ago for $700, since day one it has had numerous problems, the first time we had to take it back, they told us it was because we had new carpets!, 2nd time, it was a paper clip, 3rd, 4th 5th and so on I guess it was because it was picking dust! I wish I could use it to vacuum itself into the garbage!
Poor Quality  My Oreck arrived with the stitching to both side of the unit from the arm band so poorly stitched the machine fell off my cleaning lady and dented the hard wood floors. She had to use threat and needle to re stitch the strap on both sides.  My last Oreck lasted 16 years before it wouldn't turn on one day. This one isn't made as well. Disappointed to say the least.
May be the worst vacuum ever!  Where do I begin with how terrible this vacuum is?!  I have had it 6 months and the main vacuum has stopped turning (unless I roll over thick carpet and then the rollers roll from contact with the carpet!).  I have purchased many of these throw away type vacuums (not intending for them to be throw away but that's where it always seem to end up) and this is by far the worst.  Let's start with the "retractable" cord.  Who ever thought to require the power to be on in order to retract a cord?  Doesn't common sense tell you you need a cord for power?  With the right timing, you can yank the cord out of the wall while still coiling but don't expect to shut the machine off!  The extension wand is a joke.  It doesn't extend anywhere and I can't tell you how many times I've rammed the stupid machine in the back of my foot trying to pull it closer.  Suction is nothing to write home about.  I have a dog that sheds terribly so I really needed a quality machine.  This is not even close.  How they even put "Pet" in the name of this machine is beyond me!  It is going back to the manufacturer whether I get credit back or not.  Let them take this stupid machine home and try to have it pick up anything!  Looks like you can't get anything but a Dyson these days if you want anything of any quality!  Save you're money and invest in Dyson!
Won't hold up...  So I bought a cheap-o vac, knowing that it might only last a year or so. What I didn't expect was for it to go tits up in 3 months. I live in a small apartment, just me, one cat, no kids, vacuum once a week. At first I was super impressed, it worked great, suction was awesome, easy to empty and clean and replace filters...but one afternoon it just decided to be a crappy vacuum. Nothing wrong with it as far as I can tell. Hoses aren't clogged, spinner still spins...filters changed and good to go...just literally started to...Suck...by NOT sucking.
Very disappointed  One of the worst vacuum cleaners I ever owned I will never own another Dyson ever I call customer service couple of times and they never did nothing for me
Terrible customer service and product design defects.  I'm writing this review to let you know the pitfalls that i have had with this vacuum and not all the positives.  When this vacuum is working, i believe it to be an above average upright vacuum and is lighter than the previous dyson animal that i owned so that was a plus.  As mentioned in other reviews, the canister on this vacuum when pop off continuously when you pick it up to do stairs if you are like me and prefer to lift the vacuum to do a step as opposed to using the tangle free attachment which works ok but doesn't do nearly as good of a job.  When you use the attachments, when the hose shrinks from the suction, it tends to pull the canister over and becomes an big issue the further away from the canister you get.  A decent work around if you have large hands is to wrap your hand around where the canister pops off when you pick it up and hold it together manually.  Now after having it for exactly 3 years, where the motor attaches to the small beater bar broke so the small beater bar no longer spins.  According to customer service, this can happen due to normal wear and tear and is not covered under the warranty.  While it is just a small plastic piece that broke, the piece is part of the entire motor assembly and the replacement is over $80 plus shipping.  When I asked why it wasn't covered under the warranty they said that the failure was due to that hair getting accumulated and thus i should have removed it as part of maintaining the machine.  I am very good about doing the maintenance the manual suggests, cleaning the filters and cutting away the hair on the beater bar but no where does it say that i should take the entire beater bar apart to look for hair that got inside the center insert.  In fact it only says to take the beater bar off in the trouble shooting section for what to do if the beater bar stops turning.  Effectively, what they are saying is that if i did routinely do something that was listed under troubleshooting for an issue that i never had until the machine broke, that it is my fault the machine no longer works.  So if every time you drove your vehicle, you had to tear your engine apart and rebuild it for the warranty to apply, i don't think any of us would ever buy another new car.  I explained to them that if the consumer is intended to do this regularly, it needed to be in the maintenance section of the manual.  Or the product should be designed to prevent the hair from getting in there and the issue is a design issue and the vacuum should be recalled (or fixes should be covered under warranty).  As a compromise, i now have to send my vacuum into a repair center of which there is only 1 in my state and they will review the ticket and see if they will deem it covered under warranty.  So in the mean time, with a family of 4 and two dogs, we should just wait to see what they say and if they deem it to not be covered as the dirt builds up in our home and we wait to see if we need to order a new non-dyson replacement.  If it is not covered, i will now have to pay labor on top of the part cost to fix it.  For a company that was once known for its customer service, i was severely disappointed.  They are literally going to pay the shipping of the entire vacuum to send it to the repair shop instead of send me a new part.  Unless a miracle happens and someone reaches out to correct this situation, this will be the last dyson i ever purchase.
Escaped Quality Control  I purchased this vacuum one year ago because I have always liked Eureka canister vacs. This is a bitter disappointment however. Within the first few uses all the parts started to break down. First to go was the on/off switch. Second to go was the entire hood. Now I have to remove duct tape each time I need to change the bag- which is frequently. Word to the wise- all this work comes at the price of pinched fingers and hands as well. I think this vacuum was designed to last about one year. Now the connectors to the power head no longer makes contact with the hose. Alerted the company at the very outset of these problems and they thought everything was as it should be.  The only positive comment I can make is the power is strong for such a small vacuum. Too bad everything else self-destructs and quickly.. Save yourself a disppointment and shop around!!!
This is not a good vacuum it stop working after 2 months
More work than using a good mop
Does not scrub the floor. The circular scrubbing pads at the bottom don't push down with any pressure so its basically hovering over the surface.
Dyson DC14  I bought the Dyson DC14 reconditioned less than a year ago. Within 3 months the clutch needed replacing - it was making a horid load noise.  Once repaired it didn't have the suction it had when I first got it.  After I'd had it 7 months it had zero suction.  After several calls to the helpline I took it in for repairs. Apparently "reconditioned" Dyson vaccumns only have a 6 months warranty (not a 2 year like the paperwork that came with it).  I was not impressed.  After paying for repairs on the brushbar I've had it back less than one week.  Now the clutch has gone again - it sounds horrible.  I am not impressed and do not want to sink the money into another clutch - apparently they go alot!  What a complete waste of a lot of money.
It doesn vacuum  This vacuum has not worked since delivered and I've been expecting it to be returned
Horrible! Broke the first day I used it!!
Beware of the warranty and longevity of this.  In 2015, I got a different model and it worked fine for 2 years. In 2017, I had an issue with a previous Shark vacuum and they replaced it under warranty with this model. I had to pay a $25 shipping fee for the new one and pay to ship the broken one back ($40ish). They gave me a replacement which also worked great. So now midway through 2018, I noticed that the hose has started to crack in two places on the little hose at the bottom (in the bend) and in one place on the main hose at the top. These cracks sap the vacuum of it's power and make it harder to clean. I called customer service again and was looking just to replace the hoses under warranty.  They told me that although I was still under the 5 year limited warranty, the whole detachable bottom part that rides along the carpet was _NOT_ covered under the warranty. They said that this was due to it being an "electrical part" and "not part of the vacuum". It would cost over $80 plus shipping to replace. I don't even know if they'd want me to pay to send the broken parts back, which I would also have to pay for.  This is the part of the warranty they quoted as excluding that bottom piece: "Non-durable parts including, without limitation, filters, brushes and electrical parts which normally require replacement are specifically excluded from warranty" - Last page of the manual.  This part is designed to bend as a function of the vacuum to clean carpets. Any breakage after only almost a year of regular use is ridiculous. I wouldn't be upset at this if they just gave me replacement parts under the warranty. I'd be happy really. I spent $170 for the original and $80 is almost half of the cost for a new one, not acceptable.  I also asked for just a replacement hose to repair it myself, (which I can figure out myself), and they said that that hose is not sold individually. I would have to buy a whole new bottom part. They wouldn't even sell me those hoses, forget warranty replacement.  I haven't even begun to talk about the crack on the main hose at the top. A place very clearly designed to bend which has also cracked after just less then a year.  So do _NOT_ trust the warranty or the longevity of the parts for these. I'm now off to void whatever is left of the worthless warranty and repair it myself or just use duct tape.
Did not work and was returned.
I am not impressed  It's extremely heavy to push so could never use lower levels always had to have on high except on floors. Oh yeah, one day it just stopped working right in the middle of vacuuming. Only had for 9 months. Bad thing about ordering online, can't just take it back to store with warrenty. My last dyson lasted 10 years.
***IT QUIT WORKING AFTER 6 WEEKS***  This vacuum is a complete piece of junk.  Do NOT buy it for pet hair.  I've had it for 2 months and it's completely lost suction.  The indicator says it's clogged, but I've taken it apart and it is not clogged.  The pet hair attachment never worked from the beginning.  Horrible horrible waste of money.
dont shower first  i bought this to replace a canister shop vac i had been using for two small rooms i rent. i thought this would be smaller and easier. NOT---- oh it works fine rugs look great picks up every bit as good as the shop vac but i still have the shop vac and why you ask??? because i need the big shop vac to suck the stuff out of the canister on the hoover others have described the process as "messy" well it would qualify for descoverys dirty jobs. the powdered dust and hair and dirt collects up top and all around the tunnel housing, you open the little door and give it a shake thinking it will come out but no it won't you have to get a long thing, bar b q fork, chopstick to stick up there and try to puggle it out. no luck so you have to use another vacuum to pull the mess out. meanwhile you the floor the trash bin the air and if you are smart and go outside on the step for  this, are all covered. once you have finished you can change clothes and don't forget you will need to clean your shoes after you have showered all that fine dust is now in the laces. i have tried to give this away but no one in my family would take it ---i don't blame them
They work great but only for a couple of months then you have to throw them out and get another one and then the same thing happens.
No scrubbed floors for me!  You need to remove the screw to attach the handle. After several attempts l asked for help. Three adults couldn't get it out so I had to return it.
Bad power switch on a good machine (twice)  UPDATE May 2015: I would love to be more positive about this one-of-kind appliance. I am now on at least number 8 over the years. I stand by my good review of the original performance of the deluxe version. The last two both died due to the power switch problem (see below). Their replacements have now both died due to a new problem - they will not dispense the cleaning solution. I contacted Hoover and followed all of their suggestions with no luck. My conclusion is that the quality control at Hoover is just dreadful. This is supported by You Tube videos from the company telling you that this is a problem and providing non-effective tips for solving it! To suffer the same set of problems in one appliance tells me that the manufacturer has constant problems and the end-user is not at fault. Unfortunately, there is nothing similar from another manufacturer and I hate to keep buying one after another when there are obviously major quality issues. The last two lasted about 1 year. What to do?  I have owned many floormates over the years and this is by far the best. All of the others died over time usually because moisture got into the motor, which eventually got louder and louder until it stopped working. This one has some great features and works well. Unfortunately, a new problem has appeared. I have now gone through 2 of the new model because the power switch just stops working. In both cases, it sounded like the cleaner was about to  start and then nothing happened, and the thing was dead. I do not understand why they changed the switch from a simple, easy to use one at the top of the handle, to this obscure location that obviously has a problem
Junk  The power switch failed within a few months and now does not work at all.  It appears to be a loose connection in the wire harness. It used to shut off all the time and now won't run at all.  Junk.
Unhappy with this purchase.  I was very disapointed with this vacuum. It had no way to adjust the handle to use it. It always remainsvin a upright position. I was not able to use this vacuum . i have a disablity with my back and i had to donate the vaccume to good will industries.
extremely dissatisfied!!!  I bought this machine to replace one that I had used for over 15 years.  I never had any problems with the first one, so I spent the extra money on another Electrolux machine.  What a mistake, I have had this one less than 6 months and have had nothing but problems with it.  The company is no help and the repair center people just laughed when I told them how unhappy I was with it. They have many people with the same complaints!!!  The height adjuster has totally stopped working after being repaired twice, the attatchment door doesn't stay closed and the bag full light doesn't work at all.  I wish I had spent the money on a cheaper brand then I wouldn't be so disappointed.  Do yourself a favor and don't buy this machine, it is a cheaply made grossly over priced piece of junk!!!!
Not good.  Had to return this item.  I have tile floors and was so hoping this would work so I didn't have to keep using a mop to clean the floor.  Unfortunately, it was defective, not being able to clean up the water it spit out and I ended up with a flooded floor.
Bought many years ago and hate it  This vacuum is pretty terrible. The cons vastly outweigh the pros, which means it's not worth the Dyson name nor the price tag.  Doesn't follow well at all. Tumbles too easily. The hose is positioned to one side. Short power cord. The roller head gets easily clogged. The suction is lackluster, at best, especially on carpets/rugs. Too many joints, which can cause clogs that are hard to reach. Cheap plastic material/build. Small cansiter meant for studio apartment-sized homes. And so many more problems.  Stay away from this vacuum.
Doesn't last  I wanted to love this vacuum... it would easily be 4 stars, especially considering the price, if only it would last. Unfortunately the motor on ours has burnt out twice now, with only moderate use and good care, and going through the Hoover warranty repair process was unbearable.
Never Again  I had great hopes for this vacuum. When it arrived it was super easy to assemble, and it came as a "package" with a Bissel  3in1 vac (more like a stick broom). The price was very reasonable. However - the cord is too short, so I am constantly plugging and unplugging from outlet to outlet. The cup is small, so you have to empty it often. I just did my kitchen floor (laminate with a runner for the pups) and the kitchen is about 20'x15' - not huge. I had to empty the cup 3 times, and change outlets once. I did buy 2 extra filters because with my last vac the filters took so long to dry after washing (no.... you DO NOT NEED TO DISPOSE OF THE FILTERS) and that kept the vac out of circulation for 2-3 days. It does not make my vacuuming experience any easier... in fact it's worse. I cannot do the entire house (about 1100 square feet and mostly laminate flooring) without constant emptying of the small canister and changing outlets. The canister constantly clogs at the top, and you have to manually pull out the pet hair. The only good news is that it does have great suction. It might work well in a small living space. The best news is the the Bissel 3in1 that came with it is fantastic!
Taking this to Goodwill  My mom had this vaccuum for one year, then moved and gave it to me.  I don't like this vaccuum.  The wand is inconvenient.  You have to pull it out, turn it around, and reinsert it to use it.  My other Dyson, the red one, doesn't need all those steps.  I'm not so sure it cleans all that well either.  After four slow passes over an 8x10 area rug, I used my Hoover steam cleaner to clean the rug.  There was so much dirt left over from the vaccuum.  Keep in mind, I steam clean about every three months, and I vaccuum every one-three days.  This vaccuum is not worth its price.
Worked 3 times then suction stopped.
Leaked solution from the first use. didn't pick up liquid  I filled the solution tank and went to go plug the unit in.  2 minutes later all the solution had leaked. Figuring I might as well use the solution i went ahead and scrubbed.  When I turned the dial to pick up the liquid - it didn't pick anything up. I ended up having to mop by hand. Will return this to amazon.
Loved it at first until it broke  I loved this vacuum but after a year, I burnt up. Since I bought it refurbished, it's not under warranty.
Cute but wouldn't recomend it.  I bought this vacuum cleaner about five months ago and was disappointed the first time I used it - the same time the little red pads underneath fell off.  I have to agree with a previous reviewer and say that this is the worst vacuum I have had.  It is definitely not to be used on any carpet or rug of any depth. And I am not too impressed with its performance on tile or wooden floor, either. This little thing is only adequate for small clean up jobs; the kind of things your mother did with a broom.  It has very light sucking power which I found a little frustrating.  Also, expect to replace the very small and rather expensive bag in this vacuum cleaner fairly often.  Unfortunately, mine broke down before I even needed a new set of bags.  It may be just bad luck, but I have had problems with another DeLonghi product in the past.  The only advantage I see in this vaccum cleaner is its light weight and ability to get into some hard to reach places. On the other hand, you can just as well use the attachments in your regular vacuum cleaner for those cleaning jobs and also enjoy the benefit of the excersise.
Vacuum is defective  I received this vacuum on 4/11/16.  I have used it 4 times since receiving, since I only vacuum on weekends.  After 2 weeks, I found a silver washer on the floor after I vacuumed, but couldn't see anywhere it had fallen off.  Today, the vacuum made a shriek sound while running.  When I turned if off, the roller wheel underneath the vacuum was laying on the floor.  Evidently the washer and maybe something else was holding the wheel on.  When I tried to put the wheel back on, it would go on, but whatever is supposed to hold it on is gone.  I went on Amazon to see about returning this vacuum, since it was not solidly built from the start.  However, I was told that the return time had ended 2 days ago on 5/12/16.  I really liked the vacuum, but I question the quality of the product.  I'm not sure what to do since I just spent $140 on a vacuum that is defective.  I f you buy this vacuum, make sure you use it every day for the first month, to make sure nothing goes wrong before the return time runs out.  I have used Hoover products for years, but for the first time I am very disappointed with this purchase.
Lasted 6 months
Not impressed.  I was really excited when this product came out because I was sick of the multi-step process of cleaning my hardwood floors. However, I read all of the reviews on Amazon and delated my purchase hoping the kinks would be worked out and a better product would emerge. But then I saw  this product on Home Depot's site and it had terrific reviews, as well as on Macy's... So I bit the bullet and ordered it. I don't know what the people buying fro. The Home Depot and Macy's gift that I didn't, but this product does not live up to its Dyson name. The suction isn't impressive, and the mopping capability is even worse. I went back over all my floors with my regular swifter wet and you should have seen how dirty the swifter pad was! I would return this product if the box hadn't arrived from amazon torn the shreds.
Bummed  Stopped working after 5 months.  Bummed....  Used for Tile Floors
Does not pick up dirty water as well as original FloorMate  I had the original Hoover Floormate for 4 years & was impressed.  New version does not work nearly as well as the original.  It seems to hold more water/cleaner, but picks up only a fraction of the water dispensed.  All the dirty water is left on the floor.  I've had this a couple of months so it's too late to return or exchange it.  Definitely not worth the money spent......
i cant even rate it  this is the biggest piece of shit i have ever seen, this thing could not pick up a hooker with a 50 dollar bill ,im not sending it back,im throwing it in the street
A repair mans view  here is a different prospective for you if your thinking about buying this vac set---im a vac repair tech, and I see these in ALL the time for repair---mostly the handle breaks(very cheaply made)--the vac is noisy and the plastic fan in the motor is known to break often and clog. if your looking for a light weight vacuum---try the freedom by simplicity---around the same price its U.S. made and is very durable.
Lasted 3.5 years designed to be replaced.  Planned obsolescence  Hose failed after 3.5 years but by cutting and reattaching the broken hoses (the main hose also ripped) i was able to stretch the life to 4 years. There is no repair part in their website for the lower hose in this model, which means I would have to mail it for my warranty but after paying shipping both ways makes the repair unreasonable compared to the price of a new machine. We all know this is part of their plan so we spend more money in their new machines. Shark lost me as a costumer i do not believe in plan obsolescence is wasteful and polluting.
Very Disappointed - on to my next vaccuum  I am very disappointed with the Dyson DC25!!  I bought it because I have a yellow lab and keeping up with the dog hair and mess was very important to me.  At first, it had great suction and I felt it did a great job.  Then I noticed that even though it had great suction on my carpets, it wouldn't pick up the smallest pebble on my hardwoods.  I would have to use the handle to get the small items on the floors.  It is heavy so not a practical machine to use on the stairs and forget about the small tools.  In fact, I doubt I have used any of the accessories more than once because it soon became more work and they didn't really perform as well as they should.  I've already had it in for repairs and now there appears to be another issue with the suction and I may have to take it back again.  I am frustrated with the performance, weight and how little the canister holds.  Like all new machines, it worked great the first year or so and now, it is just as disappointing as those other machines, except I paid a lot more money for this one.  The suction was great in the beginning but after a few years is only average, just like any other vaccuum I've had in the past.
If you buy this vacuum, please buy the store warranty. I have used this unit about three times within 33 days and the brush roller will not spin. After resetting it and clean it several times, I still was not successful. Best buy would not accept the return (15 day return policy) and Samsung only offered to repair it...the repair shop is 2 hours away from my home. This unit is a headache and I will never buy another Samsung small appliance again.  Update: spoke the manager at Best Buy and the store did exchange it for me. Additionally, this vacuum was no longer in the shelf at my local store. Hmmm. I wonder if anyone else was disappointed with this vacuum.
ONLY WORKED A FEW MONTHS AND THE FEBREZE WAS TERRIBLE, WE HAD TO REMOVE IT FROM THE VACUUM  ONLY WORKED A FEW MONTHS AND THE FEBREZE  WAS TERRIBLE,WE HAD TO REMOVE IT FROM THE VACUUM.I WOULD NOT BUY ANOTHER ONE.
Hover customer service SUCKS  Ordered this item because I have one at work and it is great.  I'm giving it 1 star because when I got it there were no screws in the package to hold the handle to the base.  There was a sealed baggie taped to the front of the base (SEALED) but no screws.  I called Hover customer service at 5:30pm central time and they were already closed. A little sticker on the base said they were open until 7pm eastern time so they should have been still open.  I called today and was put on hold for 15 minutes and when the guy got back to me the screws are on back order and they don't know when they will get them.  I'm giving Hover the 1 star not the vacuum.  VERY DISAPPONITED WITH HOVER.
... tool to extend the hose the otherwise is really good sock for dust  Is missing a tool to extend the hose the otherwise is really good sock for dust
Great suction, poor reliability, poor customer service  The bagless cannister has great power and suction, when it works. The power hose/handle had electical problems when vacuum wouldn't shut off using power switch on handle. This occurred when vacuum was fairly new and customer service advice was to unplug power cord from wall. I made so many calls when it was under warranty and should have sent back before warranty expired. After warranty is up, you're out of luck. My bad....If you decide on this product, document all your calls and make sure TTI Floor care documents as well. After paying for servicing, end result is replacement of the entire power hose which costs more than half of the price of new vaccum. Not worth it! Corporate customer service is very poor and problem resolution totally unsatisfactory. Very frustrating. Only used slightly over 1 year.
Hate it  I hate this Dyson, clogs constantly & it is so complicated to look for the clog. The clog can be in 4 places. Not worth the 500+ I spent. Filters need taken out & rinsed out  every 3 months & take forever to dry. Horrible machine. It is sitting in a corner not being used. Not even a year old  Never again.
STOP! Not the One....  This Dirt Devil Breeze M088160RED, is horrible....breeze is right, front exhaust will blow your cloth coverings OFF!  The automatic floor adjustment is YOU lifting the vacuum up for rugs and down for bare floors....The back and forth vacuuming resistance kills my back. So much for the Light Weight claim in the specs.  Used it twice and unfortunately threw away the box...have to find out the return policy.  Horrible, Just horrible...shame on you Dirt Devil.
A Huge Disappointment  My husband got sucked into the hype and came home with this machine about 5 years ago. We have two short hair cats, but no wall to wall carpet, just a few rugs. And our housekeeper brings her own vacuum so when I say it gets very little use, it really gets very little use. It worked fine for a few years and then as soon as the 2 year warranty expired we started to have problems. It just stopped picking up and would have a burning rubber smell when used. First they replaced the brush and it worked twice. Then they replaced the head and it worked another couple of times. The next time I brought it in for repair they did nothing because they said they couldn't find anything wrong. But it still wouldn't pick up anything off the rugs and still had these bad smells. During all of this my husband cared for it as if it were a collector car - cleaned it as advised, emptied it before it was full, never tried to vacuum up anything that it shouldn't be used for. Then it stopped working completely, just gave up and died. Needs a new motor and some other part. So we are done with Dyson, looking at a Miele which seems to have the best reviews. We are really, really disappointed with the performance of this very expensive machine and really disgusted with the Dyson repair facility. The only reason I gave it a second star is that it is a cool machine, the way it's built and is very easy to use. But if you buy one I recommend an extended warranty, preferably with a replacement option as it won't last. And let me reiterate - although we have had it for 5 years it got used 6 times a year, if that. for 15 minutes at a time.
Terrible product and even worse customer service  RUN .... do not buy. The first three years we owned this vacuum, it broke twice and had to be sent off for repairs! The second time  it could not be fixed and they offered a replacement... a Hoover( hoover owns oreck) or an upright oreck that is NOT bag free. But... we are not sure because the oreck rep was not sure. Do Not buy Oreck... they are no longer a quality product!
Worst vacuum I've ever owned  This vacuum is horrible.  The filters constantly clog.  The smallest amount of dirt in the cup cuts down the sunction incredibly.  No floor brush is included and the hose and cord are both too short. I don't know what it was designed for, but certainly not for effortless vacuuming.
Bad Product and Less that Good Service  Second unit we purchased from Amazon.  First one stopped self propelling after a few weeks.  Returned it to Amazon and they sent us a replacement.  Now after less than 4 months the replacement unit does not propel well in forward direction and smells hot and like rubber burning. Checked and belts look OK.  Called Hoover and the say "sorry about that" and take it to a repair service, the closest of which is 20+ miles away.  Amazon order say it is now "beyond the return window" so guess we're out of luck with this bad product.
Not as good as my old one  I guess I should have paid more attention to my order, this vacuum has no light and no full bag indicator. The hose is very stiff and often disconnects from the vacuum will using it to clean furniture etc. It does do a good job on carpets and floors.
Didn't clean the floors like coffee stains and stuck on dirt. Disappointed
Before the one year warranty has expired the agitator and components burned up. Panasonic has expected me to go way beyond limits so they can honor their warranty ie, their nearest service center is over 1.5 hours one way from my home, they expect me to pay for shipping to this service center if it is too far to drive. Both outcomes cost me almost as much as the vacuum itself. I am thoroughly disappointed thus far with the product and how a very large company like Panasonic is handling this issue.
Short life span!  Bought in February, it died in November.  Could not maintain suction all the way to the end of the hose.  Replaced filters, didn't help . . . consigned to the trash.  This was the second one I owned, first one lasted about two years . . . not worth the money.
Don't Waste Your Money  I had a hoover bag vacuum for 10 years and it worked great. The Dirt Devil stopped working within two weeks - the bag kept clogging up and trying to clean it has been impossible. In addition, customer service support is horrible. I could never get through to a real person and emailing generated generic responses. Maybe this might be okay if you don't need a real vacuum cleaner. I have a husky and a child so I need something that can handle heavy duty cleaning. If you're in a similar situation, I recommend another brand. Wish I could return it.
fair  I find the hose is not made well enough for what I use it for, 2 to 3 times a day vacuuming cat litter up.  I believe the hose may last at least a year which is good, but I had trouble with the other dirt devil I had with the hose giving out on me quickly.  I was unable to buy another hose for that one as it was discontinued, so I had to buy a new vacuum.  If dirt devil could make a better, more durable hose, that would be a definite plus.
I do not recommend this vacuum! Don't waste your money!  I bought this vacuum almost a year ago. I had a few issues in the beginning but wanted to get more 'acquainted' with it before writing a review. First problems were that the button you have to push to go from bare floor to carpet was hard to push in. Then the release button to start using the vacuum began to be very hard to push. Now I have to jam my foot on it to release the vacuum so that I can start vacuuming. One of the other issues in the beginning was that it kept breaking belts. 10 months in and I have already used five. I put in the sixth one today. They don't always break. Twice they have just been so worn, they no longer turn the brush. Now to the brush. This is the main reason that I am looking for a new vacuum. At first, once I got the carpet setting button to change, the brush and the suction were fantastic. The past few months, however, have been a different story. Now I have to put the setting up so high that it will not suck up anything, let alone dog hair that gets stuck to the carpet. If I set the level to the one that previously did work on my carpet, the brush will not work. I am tired of fighting with it so I am looking for another one.
What were Bissell design engineers thinking?  The Bissell 89Q9 Lift-Off MultiCyclonic Pet Baglass vacuum cleaner's spec sheet boasts an impressive list of features, but the actual product implementation really bites the big one. Hopefully it will bite the dust before more people are fooled into purchasing it.  Immediately after unpacking the vacuum and perusing the assembly instructions I knew there would be trouble.  The only major assembly step is attaching the handle to the top of the vac, which requires a Philips screwdriver (that by itself is a minor quibble). The instructions state to slide the handle into place, and if there is a gap where the parts meet just "keep pushing".  The handle does not fit well, period. Don't bother trying for a flush fit, just install the two screws and be done with it.  Like most upright vacuums today, the Bissell uses a "slinky"-style tube to connect the vac motor to the floor piece. As usual, to clean upholstery, blinds, ceilings, etc., just unplug the hose from the floorpiece and connect the appropriate extension wand and accessory. However, there are several problems with the Bissell design. First, the hole where the tube plugs in to the floor piece is way too tight. Inserting the hose is not a problem, but removing it took more strength than I ever imagined could be necessary; there is no way my wife would be able (or perhaps not willing) to remove this tube to use the extension wand.  Second, the other end of the hose plugs into a "twist and snap" connection on the motor unit. The fit is also very tight, but this end of the hose should rarely need to be unplugged, so by itself that's no biggie. The problem is, the hose juts out perpendicular to the motor body and needs to be bent sharply up and to the side to route the hose down to the floor piece.  Technically I suppose this connection works okay but the way it looks just screams of sloppy design work, and I worry the hose is more likely to be snagged and damaged.  One of the more unique features of this upright model is its ability to detach the vacuum body from the upright frame, and use it as a canister-style cleaner.  In theory this makes it easier to clean stairs and car interiors, for example. In reality, the so-called detachable "cannister" lacks some key features that make a real cannister vacuum useful.  First and foremost, a cannister vac must be able to lie down horizontally and remain stable when in use. This Bissell pseudo-cannister is designed to stand upright ONLY which makes in woefully unstable on stairs.  If you try to lay the cannister on its side, it will still wobble and roll, dangerously -- all the while the motor's hot outlet air is blowing directly on you.  Removing the cannister from the upright frame is easy, but I found that putting it back was difficult -- actually impossible until I removed the extension wand from its parking spot on the frame. (Doesn't anybody at Bissell R&D test this stuff?)  Another failure of this poorly-executed product design is the "extension wand".  Almost all vacuums, whether upright or cannister, provide several extension wand tubes, which are tapered at one end, that can be connected together to reach high spots or behind or under furniture.  Bissell decided to be clever and discarded the tried-and-true multi-piece tapered tube design, replacing it with a single integrated "tube within a tube" and twist-lock ferruled nut.  This type of collapsible pole design is great for use in paint-roller extension poles, but it's wasteful and inefficient for use in a relatively short vacuum cleaner tube. Bissell's extension wand/tube is heavier than conventional tapered extension tubes and doesn't extend as far. And it just seems like a much more complicated and expensive solution to a problem that's been resolved for decades.  Finally, perhaps the most infuriating aspect of the 89Q9 is its use of a non-standard hose/tube size! None of my other generic accessories (nook-n-cranny wand, drapery & upholstery nozzle, shutter & blind brush, etc.) will fit.  If you're used to swapping accessories among multiple vacuums, forget it. If you have a bunch of accessories from previous vacuum cleaners which you'd like to keep using, forget it. Or if you want to buy third-party accessories, forget it. They will not work with this Bissell.  There are two or three standard sizes used throughout the world on different makes and models of vacuum cleaners; why Bissell decided to utilize this non-standard size is beyond me. (Also, relative to every other vacuum cleaner in the world, the "wide end" of the extension tube is on the wrong end. Why? Why?)  In closing, I'm very glad that I bought this vacuum... from Costco rather than Amazon, so I can RETURN the darned thing easily!
This vacuum is already broken and I have only had it for a year! Very disappointed.  This is the 2nd Shark I have owned.  I thought that when my first one broke after 2 years it was a fluke.  It does clean well.  I bought this in 12/15 and it already has lost its suction.  It will not even spin on the hard wood or carpet feature.  This is 150$ down the drain.  I am so disappointed.  I am going to try a Dyson.  The parts are just cheap plastic and don't last.
Good & Bad  I did like my fantom sweeper very much but it did break the 1st year I had it and I think when they fixed it they made it worse than it was.  Now the swivel broke and it can't even be glued.  I did find out that Fantom is in Chapter 11.  You can find parts for it at [website].
Thought I was buying an all purpose vac, wrong.  Great suction but not so great on small area rugs.  Hose broke because it is only glued into attachment.  So disappointed and a waste of money.
Not worth it...  What a waste of time and money!  This vacuum has very little sucking power.  We ditched it after less than two years, and bought an actual vacuum.  This one came highly recommended, but never seemed to actually work.
worst vacuum ever  This is by far worst vacuum i ever owned. With in a month floor attachment cracked. Power cord is stuck won't come out. Elbow for power head is broken.also on/off switch is  very closely located to a handle which makes the vacuum to be shut off accidentally .
DIDN'T GET WHAT WAS ADVERTISED ON MY SALE AND EVEN WHEN I TRIED TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT, IT STARTED FALLING APART!  My order stated that I was getting a new product and instead got a refurbished model. Thought maybe it's ok and took it out to assemble and before I even got to use it, it started falling apart! Very discouraged since, even when I called the manufacturer, they had trouble finding my registration making it even harder to get help.
Not Good for Homes with Pets and Children  Both of my sisters bought this vacuum and both are disappointed... 2nd sister returned it. If you have NO pets and NO children and vacuum every day or several times a week, go for it... But, if you have a full-time job, children, pets, and live in a house where the outside inevitably gets inside even if you take your shoes off at the door - and have to set aside a slot in your calendar to vacuum, forget about it. I have a Hoover Wind-Tunnel - it's heavy, bulky and a little hard to maneuver - the suction is so strong I break out into a sweat when I vacuum - and it gets every speck of dirt and dog hair off my floors and  carpets... keeps my upper body in shape too. If you want "technology and sleekline design", get the Dyson - if you want really clean carpets and floors, keep looking. It's not worth it at the price.
No good  No not buy.  Cheap switch broke after return window closed.
Beware!  I have had this vacuum for 7 mos.  when I first got it and used it, I was so impressed with the suction and all the dirt and dust and dog hair (I have a Black Lab) that it collected.  Then, in a couple of months it had to be cleaned.  The filters and the canister.  It was  not hard to take apart or put back together. but as the months went on and I vacuum every other day o my first floor and do my entire house cleaning on Saturdays, the vacuum got smelly and emptying the canister after every use was disgusting!  The dirt and dust flies all over, and don't even think about putting it in the kitchen trash can... it's just gross!  I had to take it outside to empty it and shake the canister and then get a duster and get the remaining dust out. This vacuum is very heavy.  I'm a small person, and it's much too heavy for me to haul around and up and down the steps.  My back hurt after I used it. I have since purchased another vacuum (not an Oreck because they are useless too). I'm upset with myself that I bought into the marketing scam of Dyson!! Now I'm out almost $600.00 as they will not refund because I don't like the vacuum!
Vac was perfect but the cord was too heavy.
skip this model and go with another one from Kenmore  The pole to hose attachment lock is defective, once you click it in, you can not remove it because the plastic release button is not lined up with the metal ball catch as it should be.  The floor head is extremely small doubling the work you will have to do to clean compared to traditional vacuum cleaners(the other accessories included with this model are equally useless so do not throw away the accessories from your old model).  The HEPA filter bag still leaves a smell of dust while vacuuming and causes dripping nose to the operator, but the smell does not linger long after vacuuming.  skip this model and go with another one from Kenmore.  (their older models did not have these issues)
Worked great, but only the first time I used it.  The first time I used this vacuum, it worked quite well.  The second time I used it, even though I had cleaned it out after the first use, it seemed to be clogged.  Its performance was worse each time I used it.  I've cleaned out the filter, checked all the areas the manual suggested and it's totally broken now after only 3 uses.
Great if you want to wear ear protection!  Beautiful to look at.  Self-propelled.  Great suction.  Horribly LOUD with a whistle that doesn't stop.  Had to send mine back after 2 weeks of trying  The search is on again.
weak, doesn't clean well at all,  very very weak. Not anywhere near as good as the heavier model
if u want a headache and like to tinker buy this vacuum  I bought this vacuum to upgrade my hoover and after replacing filters and hoses im about ready to throw it out.  It has been so much maintenace and loses suction all the time.  I still have my old hoover windtunnel and it works great and half the price.  Ive called dyson many times and really not satisfied with the product for the money.  The other problems ive had with this vacuum is the brush spinner will stop ofter and you will have to reset irritating.  The suction is poor,  Ive had to replace the expensive filters and it did not work any better. Dont waste your money.
Not Satisfied with the results  I Bought my Dyson after I found myself continually borrowing my friends Dyson. I bought my Dyson in new condition (not refurbished) from Sears in February 2013 and it was in the shop less than 2 months later. I vacuum once a week and have approximately a 1800 sq foot home; in my opinion, my vacuum is not over used or abused. I also have 1 indoor dog. Yes, the repairs were free as Dyson offers a very nice warrenty, however I felt 2 months was very short to be having issues. Barely a year since date of purchase, I just got my Dyson out of the shop for a third time. I used it on my carpets after going two weeks without vacuuming (due to the turn around of Sears repair shop) & the dirt collection was not what I expected. I borrowed my moms vacuum just to "double check" and the canister was nearly full after just one bedroom. Im highly disappointed with my purchase and im not certain whether my issues are isolated to just the Dc33 model or if I just purchased a lemon. However after my experience with my moms $180 vacuum out performing my $400 Dyson, I encourage potential buyers to do their research.
meh.  its an ok vacume. it has good features but a lot of draw backs.  you have to bend down with the wand to get a good suction on the carpet. which if your tall like me it kills the back. i like the cord is self winding and the canister is light but its just not that powerful.
Electrolux is ten times better!!  God I totally wish I read these reviews before buying this titanic. Like with some of the others who reviewed this, I too got suckered into this. It all started when I received a phone call that said "congratulations, your friend has chosen you to receive a free carpet cleaning". At the time I thought it was so nice of him to choose me, but I now know that isn't exactly how it went down.  The sales people tell you that if you can give them the names and phone numbers of 10 friends and family members who would benefit from a free carpet cleaning, they will take money off of the price of a new vacuum. So that's how they worm themselves into people's houses. They call you and make it seem like your friend is giving you this wonderful gift. So then you kind of feel obligated to accept your "gift". I have 3 dogs and at that time had really needed my carpets shampooed anyway, so it seemed like the perfect time if any.  What's so funny is I knew in the back of my head that it had to be some sort of sales ploy just to get into your home, because nothing in this world is for free. So I told myself just get your free carpet cleaning, be strong, focus, DO NOT make eye contact and DO NOT let them sell you ANYTHING!! Haha  Siiiiigh, sadly to say I did lose focus and was not strong :( But it's only because they wore me down!! They started by showing me every attachment known to man that this thing has. The salesgirl told me that the vacuum is basically like a car engine, it has that much power. She even quoted me some equivalent type of horsepower comparable to a v6 engine in a car. She said this was the mercedes benz of vacuums and that it will be the last vacuum I will ever have to buy. When she vacuumed my carpet, it seemed really powerful and sounded like a leer jet. She even vacuumed my poor dog!! I kid you not. It comes with an attachment to vacuum the pet hair right off your pet, so she proceeded to vacuum the poor thing. She also showed me how the vacuum breaks down and comes apart that you could even clean the stairs with it, almost making it like a little dust buster. She showed me how you could blow up an air mattress with one of the attachments and it came with a carpet shampooer. It seemed like it had everything!!  Lastly, she showed me how disgustingly filthy my house was with these round white pads. She used an attachment and vacuumed my bed with it. Once she took the white pad out, it was filled with all of this nasty dust and bedbug looking thingys. Soooooooo I ended up buying this monstrosity.  I have used this thing 3 or 4 times and it now sits downstairs in my basement collecting cobwebs. None of the bells and whistles work as good as she said or as good as when she was here. So I can't be bothered anymore.  First the thing is so frigin heavy it's unbelievable. Who would want to lug that around? It doesn't vacuum well at all. You could literally place the vacuum on top of a crumb and it won't suck it up. It will however suck up your entire scatter rug because of it's "jet" like engine, but not a crumb on the floor. When you are vacuuming, it leaves a horrible odor in the room. The air mattress function does not work at all and I found this out after inviting my sons friends to stay the night and tried pumping the mattress with air with my new handy dandy vacuum. NOT!!!!! I ended up having to blow up the mattresses myself, I was so embarrassed. When you put this into drive mode, which they call the "tech drive power assist", it hardly "drives", so you are forcing this to move, so it's stiff and hard to maneuver.  Bottom line, save your money and the headaches and just buy an electrolux. I used to have one years ago that my mother handed down to me and I loved it, but it was old and died and at that time I thought a new one was too expensive to buy. Meanwhile I ended up buying this piece of metal for 2 times the price and it sits in the basement. I finally sucked it up and bought the electrolux and love it!! It's so light weight and convenient and so easy to use. It picks up everything and the replacement bags are cheap online. So PLEASE do not make the same mistake I did, because you will kick yourself in the end.
Attachments won't stay on  Bought the upright and this was included in the purchase as the equivalent of an above ground and floor vac.  Tiny capacity, but my main issue is that the tools are a pressure fit onto the hose and keep falling off.  I can't use the floor tools for more than a few minutes without needing to tighten them.  This is NOT a substitute for vacuum attachments and I am looking for another vac.
Truly hideous...but the best I have found in the U.S.  I detest this vacuum.  Unfortunately, it is about the best you can do in the U.S.  There's no suction adjustment.  The bag is tiny.  The hose is short.  It's ugly.  It's clumsy.  Every time I use it I pine for the French-designed Moulinex I use in my home abroad - a marvel of design and function, sadly not available here.  If the U.S. would manufacture products with the same flair for design as European products, I would buy them.
Waste of Money  I bought the item four years ago because of its bagless feature but due to a number of problems I experienced with the vacuum cleaner I barely used it. At first the "Adjustable Deluxe Nozzle" stopped working. After I took it apart and cleaned it up, it worked for a while and then stopped again and again. Eventually I threw it away and bought a simpler nozzle and was happy for some time. However it did not last long. The vacuum cleaner became unusable again and forever. The problem was that one day the retractable cord disappeared inside the cleaner and could not be retracted any more. I attempted to take the cleaner apart but failed to do it without damaging its body. That was it. It was my last try. The warranty no longer valid, the only option for me is to put the thing into the garbage canister.
HEAVY
YOUR WARRANTY IS NOT GUARANTEED and YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE THE ATTACHMENTS  First my vacuum didn't come with the attachment that is clearly stated in the product description. Dyson said that refurbished models do not necessarily include all of the attachments. MAYBE THEY SHOULD SAY THAT SOMEWHERE ON THE PRODUCT PAGE? My vacuum suction stopped working after two months. I reached out to dyson support and they said my six month warranty ran out 10 months ago, when i've only had the product for TWO MONTHS. Then they told me I could return the vacuum FOR NO REFUND and receive a 20% discount on a new product. This has been HORRIBLE customer service. I wish I had just bought a brand new one.
Piece of total crap!!!  This vacuum worked ok for about a month, although the hose never really worked the suction is equivalent to picking up a straw and sucking through it. After a month the vaccuum started picking up less and less. Now it actually started blowing debris back out of it and I have had to throw it away. Granted it only cost me $40, but that is really $40/a month if that's all it last for. I can't believe these other 5 start reviews I am reading. This vaccuum is CRAP!!!!
Waste of Money  Stay away from this product, the electricity trips every time I plug it in. Also the design is so poor I regret why I did not return in time
Don't let the name 'Electrolux' fool you  To our dismay, after we bought the Electrolux Aptitude, we found out it doesn't perform as well as other Electrolux vacuums.  The reason - Electrolux bought out Eureka and are marketing the Aptitude Vacuum with their name on it!  How did we find this out?  We could NOT buy the belt or bag at the store we bought the Electrolux at because it is NOT a true Electrolux product.  It's a Eureka with an Electrolux name.  Save yourself the journey and either buy a more expensive model of Electrolux or a less expensive vacuum in another brand.  This vacuum is NOT worth the price!
Danger! Read reviews  Please! DO NOT take a chance on ANY Shark product. Taking my 250.00 + Infinity out to the trash today...less that 3 yo. Here is the bottom line! Yes...all Vacuum's are cheap, made of plastic and made in China... But here is the problem with Shark product's. There is NO customer service and NO parts available to repair broken a Shark! If you need a belt or light bulb, you might find it. ANY other item...your done. Go to the website and search for parts. Google Shark and search for parts. Call 1*888*866*9600 in New York ( an operating LLC for them ) and try to find replacement parts. The design and "info-mercials" are great....but when you need a part...it's over. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
Regret buying cheap. You get what you pay for.  Have had product 3 months and have used it only for normal house work. No heavy use at all. Today the motor has decided to shut down and when I was trying to trouble shoot noticed product was quite hot around cord retract area. Seems it electrically burned itself out. Possibly bad ground? No smell and brush and motor sounded normal before sudden shutdown. I will never buy a lower end vacuum again. This was my first. Positive side I guess is that it shut down without starting on fire. Now after three months a $125 vacuum is worth nothing to me as a repair will make it a $200 piece of equipment that may or may not break again....
Buyer Beware!  Buyer Beware!  Kenmore doesn't  honor the warranty unless purchased at Sears.
Do Not Buy It is not worth the money!  I bought this item in Jan of 2010 and yes it had great suction.  The downfall is that it tears up the edges of your carpet, seriously tore up my good carpet and it is extremely heavy and I am pretty strong.  The other problem is the switch on off switch broke and hsb had to fix it twice.  I know it does not cost very much I bought it in Jan 2010 and now it is April 2011 and it is already quit working on me.  The motor still runs but the rotor at the bottom quit spinning and we get it working then it stops again.  This is definetly not worth the money.  Honestly If I could send it back for a refund I would but I have not checked in to the return policy I am sure I cannot return it.  Good luck on your decision making
"noise maker"  No use, it is not a vacuum cleaner, just a "noise maker"
The crevice tool was missing. The machine was described as "pristine." The missing piece should have been noted. Now I will have to scramble and spend money to correct this.
Cheap  Done, and Im 43 single male never use it. Quality lasts longer than price.
Not loved by this pet lover  Disappointed by this product. I'd rank it good on tile but lacks corner suction. Did have to repeat areas to catch what was missed first go around.  On carpet, I'd rank it poor. Difficult to move on carpet and neeed multiple runs to pick up surface material. Didn't feel it cleaned deep enough. Pet attachment didn't perform any better.
Disappointing.  This is the third mighty mite I've purchased.  I loved the other two and they each lasted several years before all the attachments and wheels started falling apart - but even when I replaced them the motors were still going strong.  I've had this new one for two weeks and I'm very disappointed.  I don't know what's wrong but it doesn't have anywhere near the suction power of the others.  I changed the bag and checked all the attachments for blockage, but it's been bad since day one.  I'm even wondering if it's got the smaller 9amp motor instead of the 12amp I ordered.  It says 12amp on the box but I can't find anywhere on the actual vacuum that tells the amps.  Anyway, it really isn't going to work for me and I'm going to have to go with another brand.  Very frustrating waste of time and money.
I really wanted to like it but........  I read all the reviews and decided to chance it but it just doesn't work.  Debris gets clogged in the roller part and then whatever you have vacuumed in the last couple minutes comes falling back out.  It is counterintuitive for a vacuum.  I tried it several different times.  It is a VERY light duty vacuum that is selective in what it sucks up.  I am really sorry it didn't work because I REALLY wanted it to.  I am returning it.
BAD.  This thing SUCKS, because it doesn't suck up hardly anything. I'm coming off a Dyson, lost to a tragic accident, bought this to have something....could do just as good a job with a stiff broom ON CARPET!!!!!! Horrible vac,what it does pick up gets stuck in intake and it overheats and shuts its self off.... save your money and get a Dyson!!!!
not worth it  I have had this item for 5 months at first my only compliant was the hose it barely stretches at all and the vacuum falls over every time i use it now recently the vacuum has become extremely hard to even push i am so upset about this purchase
Better products out there!  I have been sadly disappointed in this vacuum. It does not clean deep, like a lot of the reviewers have said, it leaves a row of dirt behind it, and the cord got caught inside the second time I used it. I have had other Hoovers that were great. Unfortunately, this is not one of them!
used once... went to use a second time and all suction power was gone. Made sure it was cleaned out but the system seems to overheat very quickly. All parts are clean and clear but the suction completely disappeared on the second use
Value but not quality.  Meh - you get what you pay for with this product for sure.
Buyer Beware!  Wand was almost unusable when first purchased due to its stiffness and inflexibility.  Now the wand is stuck, cannot get it out, and totally unusable.  For the price of this vac I could have bought 2 or 3 of another brand and had much better products.  Will not buy another Dyson anything!  I only give it a 2 star because the suction is ok.
Not good on wood....  Scratches wood floors. Would never buy again.
Not what I expected from Hoover  Power cord gets dangerously hot, Hose is so short, units tumbles over when using. Tools assortment is non-existent. The only thing this vacuum has going for it, Dirt cheap and has fairly good suction. I don't expect it to last beyond a year, It is that poor of build quality. Spend the extra cash and get yourself a quality unit.
Warning the clips that hold hoses and dust cup bottom snap.once they break there no replacments
I am very unhappy with the quality of the product  At the Beginning it works very good, really is very powerfull, but it stopped working after 2 weeks, after Some hours Began to work it, and it repeated until about three or four times until today. Over two days since I received vacuum bulb has not worked, then recently it was broken and handle because it is a very bad quality. "Pet Turbo tool" is very difficult to clean. I am disappointed with this product
Not worth it  Broke twice with the same problem. It pours out liquid without having to squeeze nozzle. Leaves puddles
Sub Par equipment  Purchased this item for occasional use - it's small and was used in a seperate, smaller, mostly unused are of our home. Was used on average twice a month the vaccumn 2 area rugs both 10' x 12'. the motor burned out after 7 months. Even though a small price in the begenning it's cost effectivess was extremely high. Also, after reading about this particular vaccumn (after the purchase) I believe there was a part missing. The filter and cup that held it. It is light weight and easy to store but poorly construced of sub par materials.
the problem with this vacuum ii it doesn't suck!
let the buyer beware!!!  I bought this model at a home garden center near me...not sure if I am allowed to state the name of the store. Anyway, it worked like a dream for almost a full year. Not a single problem.  The suction on carpeting was great.  It not only vacuumed carpets thoroughly, but it had an upholstery attachment, albeit small.  The bare floor attachment was a bit wide for small areas, but it did the trick.  Then exactly 10 months later...After pressing the power button, not a sound issued forth.  The light indicator did not display on the lower vacuum either.  It had worked like a dream for almost a year, and like they say:  "if it sounds to good to be true, it generally is!"  What a waste of money!  And we aren't talking $200 or less.  I paid over $500 for this hunk of junk.  After calling the 800 number that is in the manual, and jumping through all the hoops to find a repair drop-off location, I was given 3 bogus phone numbers that were out of service.  I was livid!!!  I called the number back and instead of speaking to the original person, I asked to speak to a supervisor and aprised her of the situation.  She tried to give me the same numbers, only this time I warned her not to in advance.  She then gave me the name of several drop off centers in VA, none of which were remotely close to me....the nearest location was an hour drive one way, which is not what I had in mind.  I looked up a local vacuum repair shop near me that was not one of the ones on their list.  The man proceeded to tell me that there were 3 of the same model vacuums like mine, sitting in his office waiting for parts that had been on order for several months.  He told me that these parts may be obsolete.  And that a part usually never took that long to receive...over 3-6 months???  Come on give me a break!  Oh, btw....The repairman told me this alleged "Electrolux Oxygen 3" model is "not" a genuine electrolux. That if I wanted to buy a genuine "Electrolux"...try looking up Aerus electrolux vacuums online. The Electrolux Oxygen 3 model, according to this repairman is not really an "electrolux", but he said they probably paid to use the name and he believed it was really a Eureka model.  Curioser and curioser.....
do not advice  I have been searching for vacuum cleaners and cannot find the right one yet. I have had this vac for a year and it finally died on me. After owning this vac for a few months it overheated on me, popped a belt and had to replace the washable filters 6 times because they would produce a stench that I just did not want to smell. I think it cleaned well with good suction but that was about it. If you pull the retractable cord tightly the power on this vac would flicker like it was going to die. I am not an electrical but believe its a safety concern. I highly advice against this particular model. Its does not last long and has way too many problems to deal with
Don't buy this vacuum cleaner if you hope to use it to clean upholstery. The badly designed three-in-one attachment comes apart constantly when I'm attrmpting to vacuum the furniture, and when it's not coming apart, it doesn't create enough suction to get the dirt and dust off the upholstery. And to make matters worse, the tubes and hoses are oddly shaped so that generic attachments won't work with it. Thanks, Electrolux, for providing a $400 product that fails to perform its intended purpose.
Not what I expected  I gave it 3 stars because it is powerful, but I expected it to be easier to use. It's heavy to move around. Even with the self propel power button on it feels like a clunker. I bought it for the self propel button thinking it would not be hard to push. It's hard to manipulate around corners and the extensions keep coming off. The picture of the woman using it so easily on stairs is misinformation about the product as far as I'm concerned. I have had this since Feb 2011 and thought it would be my main vacuum, but I only use it occasionally when I really want to clean up, maybe once a month or less. In between on a more weekly basis I use the one I have to charge a battery. Not worth it.  REVIEW #2: Now it is December and I use this thing maybe once a month for heavy cleaning over the cordless vac that works pretty good. So, I'm using it and it smells like it's burning. I left it running for a few seconds and when I went back there was ash marks on the carpet. I say "ash marks" versus burn marks because I was a least able to clean it using Resolve. I need something better and light weight. After reading reviews on more expensive products, I'm confused. I intend to call Hoover to find out what's going on. If it needs a new part, even a fan felt, it didn't even last a year. Not worth it.
pass this one by -look further for others  I have had my eureka for about 4 years.  After about 1 year the hose was clogged and was able to unclog it by sticking a pole up the hose  to clean it out.  It got clogged again and the only solution was to cut the hose and retape it.  It got clogged a few times after that.  I now have the hose taped to the vaccum where i cut it.  Seems to be working ok now but it should of not gotten clogged in the first place. I would not recomment this.  The hepa filter is also expensive.
Vacuum sucks..not literally  This vacuum is less than a year old and it's been to the repair shop numerous times. Now, there is a bearing loose that makes the vacuum sound so loud, people remark on it..It takes me many more passes to vacuum an area than it used to. Highly regret this vacuum that has seemingly never worked right.
BEWARE and run away from this dud  If there was an option for zero stars I would have chosen it. This vacuum's engine went dead--totally dead--after 8--and I mean 8--uses.  Apparently I only had two months to return it and I'm out of the window. I'm going to check with them anyway to see if they will refund my money. What a disappointment!
Since then I've had to constantly clear the intake of whatever the weak suction managed to pick up or it squeals like a pig  The first time I used this vacuum I thought I had made a decent purchase. Since then I've  had to constantly clear the intake of whatever the weak suction managed to pick up or it squeals like a pig. I'm not really vacuuming as much as should be because it makes me so mad to use. I'll have to wait until I can afford a mans vacuum before I can have a clean house I guess.
Poor bare floor cleaning  Using the bare floor tool included is a waste of time.  The tool's long bristles prevent reasonable suction.  Therefore, debris on a bare floor does not get suctioned easily.  You must go over an item several times in order to clean. Would not purchase this item knowing this.
Very Disappointed!  I purchased this carpet cleaner (not from Amazon) because the majority of reviews I read, from different sources, were very positive.  What I found was something quite different.  This machine lays down way too much water and solution.  I went through a 60 oz. bottle of cleaning solution and was not even able to finish cleaning a relatively small room.  The only settings on which it doesn't lay down water and/or solution are the spot clean and spill pickup.  As a result, the carpet takes days, not hours, to completely dry. While cleaning that same small room, I had to fill the water tank, and empty the dirty water tank 5 or 6 times.  Other cleaners I've had allowed the user to control when water or solution were applied to the carpet.  If you didn't apply water or solution, the cleaner vacuumed up water and the brushes continued to rotate.  Not so with this one! If I could take it back, at this point, I would.  I would not recommend this machine at all.
A Waste of Money! Poorly manufactured piece of plastic machinery.  I got this exact vacuum another popular retailer that starts with a K and ends hls and I paid more for it than Amazon is currently charging for it.  It does a good job with getting up the dirt, grime, and pet hair, but once you clean all the parts after use, the dust cup is very difficult to put back on the machine.  Don't waste your money like I did, buying this vacuum.
The machine won't start.  I've checked everything, cleaned everything.....still won't start.  I'm really dissapointed.
Sadly disappointed  At first this seemed a really great product and worked well. Three months into using it just once a week, the sprayer device quit working and repair costs are not covered. Repairing it would cost almost as much as buying a new one. The two repair shops I spoke to said this is an ongoing problem with the product. Now I just pour the water and cleaning solution on the floor myself. Will purchase another brand next time.
This was delivered on March 27, 2018.  It is July 9, and the vacuum just quit working.
Not a gem  A painfully loud machine--and very heavy. I'm sorry I bought it and would have returned it but I was past Amazon's 30 day return period. I'm now trying to sell this for much less on Craig's List. Look me up if you're interested.
Not worth buying by any measure  I don't understand how this vacuum has such great reviews. Sure, it has a lot of metal parts. So what? It still works terribly.  My main gripe is that this vacuum cannot clean hard floors. It will kick dirt and debris around all over the place though. Try vacuuming a hard floor bare footed and you will actually FEEL the debris hitting your feet as they are shot around.  On carpet, this vacuum does better, but again, it will still kick dirt around.  I want a vacuum that will suck dirt and debris up, not fling it around everywhere.  Also, I'm not sure if this is due to our having dogs in the house, but whenever I use this vacuum, it immediately disperses a terrible smell consisting of hair, dander, and dirt. I'm not really experienced with different vacuums, but it seems to me that they shouldn't do this.  I do not recommend buying this vacuum.
Do not waster your money!  Wish I could give this better ratings, and it was cheaper to ship back, but it is not, and I cannot.  It is very lightweight and the plastic is very cheap and not confidently strong to the touch or feel.  I don't like it at all.  The nozzle has a stiff, plastic hose that is very hard to use and the thing is just crap.
If you want wet sloppy, dirty floors, get this. forget your 2 year limited warranty, not going to happen!  I bought my Hoover FloorMate one year ago and it doesn't work. Water leaks out everywhere. I empty it after every use but some water is up inside and it dumps out everywhere. It no longer sucks up water just pushes it around and my floors are filthy. It doesn't work. I'd give this a zero star if I could. It supposedly has a 2 year limited warranty but Amazon makes it impossible to figure out how to get this item serviced.  Amazon says to go to the returns page and "if the item is eligible" there will be an option for repair. Guess what? It's not an option. Hmmm maybe they should tell you 2 year limited warranty means too bad. This product really sucks. Had I bought it at Costco then there would be no hassle return. I will not buy anything like this here again and certainly nothing from Hoover. Dismal waste of money! Update: I finally got a rep on chat who told me to take it to authorized Hoover repair shop which I did. A part had busted and apparently it breaks a lot so I bought an extra. The repair shop was awesome and got it fixed but I did have to drive across town and be without it for about 10 days. Even though it is now working fine, I just don't think this gets the floor all that clean. I am very disappointed and not too happy with Amazon customer service who made it very difficult to find out how to get this serviced.
No bags  Can't wait to use vacuum however it didn't come with three bags like promised.
requires a lot of maintenance!  Worked amazing and first. now I can hardly use it without taking it apart to clean and replace the belt ever other use.  Mine is extremely loud now when it runs as well. Given that my black lab shreds a lot.. For a pet vacuum I feel like it should be able to handle much better.
Will not turn on  I really like the product when it works. After only 4 months it will not turn on.
Love to Hate  I had this vac and loved it.  Gave it to my brother and bought a new one.  Tried to use it last Friday for the first time and each time I pushed it forward it shut off.  Obviously, something is seriously wrong.  Will be taking my brand new, non-working vacuum to an authorized Hoover repair shop this week.  Bah!  Who needs the hasle.
Wish I could send it back!  Spent a lot of time reading up on different vacuums.  We had purchased Samsung washer/dryer and were very pleased so thought this was a good choice.  After a couple months it lost suction and has never been as strong.  The bare floor attachment has nothing to protect the floor from the plastic bottom and it scratches my floor!  It did not come with any usable attachment for cleaning upholstery.  I would not recommend this vacuum based on my experience.
Never again.  This vacuum is going to the basement. Just have one room with carpet. A bedroom that is never used. Good place for a vacuum that is never used. Time for another upright upstairs. The darn thing flips over. The hose is stiff, not flexible at all. Wish I had my money back.
Stopped picking up after three months and belt replacement, terrible customer service  Stopped working after a couple months, terrible customer support  I bought this vacuum to replace a Dyson based on the Consumer Reports rating. This vacuum worked very well when we first bought it. The three months in it stopped picking up. The hose still had suction, though, so it's not due to our not cleaning it. I took it to a Sew-Vac to have it inspected. The belt was broken and they replaced it. But it is still no picking up. Aside from my disappointment that the vacuum stopped working, the customer service from Hoover is TERRIBLE. I could never get through to the phone number. When I emailed, I received a rather unhelpful, disjointed response, with no offer to fix or replace the vacuum if it was not working.
VERY UNSATISFACTORY Vacuum!  Don't buy it!!!!!!!!!  While I am completely dissatisfied with this vacuum, it does have some good points:  It's very lightweight, the parts change eaasily, and it's not difficult to remove the dirt canister for emptying.  It's even an attractive design.  However, this vacuum has barely any suction!!!!!  It leaves behind 80% of the dirt; it is better at accumulating pet hair on the end of the attachment, so I have to pull it off constantly, then try to coax the vacuum to suck it up, and it is a bust on cat litter.  On our new Pergo flooring, in rooms where traffic is minimal, the performance is very poor; it leaves even dust behind.  I have absolutely wasted over $100.00!!!!!  And, I will NEVER buy a bagless vacuum again!!!!!!  Although it is easier to open the dirt canister than on another model I have tried, you still, at some point, have to use you hands to pull out dirt!!!  The collected dirt shakes easily out of one compartment, but a piece has to be pulled out of the neighboring compartment, and the dirt extracted  by hand. Yuck!!   Our previous vacuum was a traditional canister Miele, and it worked for many, many years.  I am SO sorry that I did not stick to my guns and buy a new one!!!!  I wanted to avoid the expense of bags, but you can get them more cheaply on Ebay and save lots.   DO NOT PURCHASE this vacuum!!!!!!!!!  I have just missed the return window, so I'm out of luck!
Loud and lousy  This vacuum had high customer reviews so I bought it.  I must have gotten a lemon.  It is so loud no one in our house wants to use it.  We also have a house of girls with long hair and a hairy dog.  This vacuum constantly gets "bound" by the hair.  I have had it 4 months and am looking for a replacement already.  I wish I could return this vacuum.
Very disappointed.  I stopped picking up the first week I had it.  I brought in another old vacuum which picks up much better and am now trying to decide what to buy next.  Not a Hoover.  Years ago I used a very inexpensive Hoover which worked very well.  Though noisy, it served the purpose better than any of the other Hoover's I have used since it has no longer been available.  Get some new engineers Hoover!
STINKS  I'm trying to clean my house, and this vacuum fills it with the scent of smelly dust.  It is really offensive.  It's also very bulky.  Filters VERY hard to clean.  Debris gets stuck in that white rotary thing, u can't get out.  Worst though is it STINKS.  So disappointed, replacing with a Miele.
This is the worst vacuum I've probably ever used  This is the worst vacuum I've probably ever used.  My parents Kirby from 20 years ago does a better job.  Any little thing will clog this vacuum, you will spend all your time cleaning the tool that is supposed to be cleaning for you.
too flimsy  Product: Cheaply made. Hard to work with as the product is too flimsy. I had to return it. I don't recommend this product to anyone.  Delivery: Delivered on time and without damage.
grrrrrrr.....  Used this vaccum for about a total of 12 hours and it is already broken and needs to be sent in to be fixed... NOT impressed....
poor hose function  I bought this vacuum after my old dirt devil (which I loved and had for 10 years) broke.  This vacuum does not work nearly as well.  It tends to get clogged and requires frequent cleaning.  But the really terrible part is the hose.  I use the hose A LOT!  Well this one is poorly constructed.  The two parts fit together very loosely, so suction is poor.  I literally have had to run it over crumbs, etc. two or three times to get it to pick them up.  I'm not at all happy and will look for another vacuum.
Deserves  a Zero  This product is such a waste of money.  It does not have any suction.  The only thing it does is spin the brush.  Do not buy this vacuum.  I'm stuck using my handheld vacuum to clean the whole house until we can afford a new and better upright vacuum.  I'm so angry!
Stopped working after 3 months!  Worked like a charm the first few months we had it.  It was a joy to use, but then the suction force reduced significantly, and eventually the motor began to let out a really loud noise.  It got to the point where we would have to use ear plugs just to run the vacuum.  Rather then pay to ship to Hoover for repair, we purchased a Shark and couldn't be happier.  Buyer beware.
Burnt up after a couple months
This is a 2nd time around and this last one didn't even last 90 day! I will never buy Hoover products again!
Doesn't REALLY clean  I purchased this vacuum a couple years ago because of hype around it.  I was somewhat happy with it, but never felt it had the power that they described.  Recently I bought a Bissel Healthy Home vacuum to have as a second vacuum, and my wife and I saw this to be a perfect opportunity to test the two.  Here is what we found out...  We first vacuumed with our Dyson, then with our Bissel.  The Dyson did pick up the cat hair, but no dirt or anything.  There was just cat hair in the canister.  The Bissel pick up about a half inch worth of dirt out of the carpet.  So, the Dyson picked up only the stuff sitting on the very top of the carpet, while the Bissel picked up the real dirt.  The Dyson is light weight, easy to clean, has a long hose for cleaning stairs, but is not very powerful.  The Bissel is very heavy, the hose is not as long as the Dyson, but very powerful and picks up dirt that is deep in your carpet.
Was a great Vacuum for about 9 months  I haven't owned a lot of vacuums in my life, so this might be kind of like the guy who gets his first sporty car thinking that his new miata is the most amazing car ever, but this is the best vacuum that I've ever owned. It cleans the carpeted floors very well, and it's fun to put it in the middle of the hardwood floor in the dining room and watch everything on the floor migrate from all corners of the room to the vacuum like space dust into a black hole. The thing seems durable and the wand reaches the top part of my vaulted ceiling without needing to lift the vacuum off the floor. It's not super expensive when compared to other vacuums in it's class and it does it's job well. Update:One year later, and the vacuum doesn't work very well anymore. The bagless container that holds all of the vacuumed up stuff doesn't make a seal with the vacuum lines to the motor, and thus doesn't really suck anything up anymore.  It just makes noise.  It was an awesome product, but it's durability is very bad.
Alot of excess water comes out when cleaner is tipped for cleaning  Works good, but spills water all over the floor. I did not overfill. It sucks up the water on "dry" mode - but my socks get all wet when mopping. I used it once, and then we replaced our flooring and I will not use this on our new floor because of the excess water, so now its useless and I am past the return window or I would be returning this item.
Can't suck up a cheerio...  Despite the suction being decent on carpet, this machine has never been able to lift cheerios off my wood floor.  The cord is ridiculously short.  I cannot vacuum a 15x28 simple rectangular room without having to stop, unplug and find another socket closer to the area I'm vacuuming.  The cord that attaches the head to the wand frequently loosens and needs adjusting.  Attaching the various tools to the metal wand end is a joke.  There is no attachment "system", no pins, no rubber washers, nothing.  You literally shove a plastic attachment onto a metal wand and hope it holds, which it often doesn't.  I frequently have to re-attach the horsehair brush when I'm doing my tile floors.  More bad news, no bag replacement or dirt sensor indicators.  For 1/2 the price of this vacuum I've seen other brands that offer both those indicators.
too hard to push around attachments do not roll smoothly over carpet and or other areas.
Well I liked it for a couple of months. Then it was difficult to get the dust catcher on. Now it's making a horrible noise and I  Well I liked it for a couple of months. Then it was difficult to get the dust catcher on. Now it's making a horrible noise and I think it's going to kick the bucket
Disappointed by the new design  We have had two Hoovers of this type over the last 35 years and my wife loved them. She especially likes the light that tells her when there is still dirt that needs to be picked up. When our last one broke down after many years of faithful service it was only natural for us to purchase the latest edition of this model. The vacuum itself works fine. But, we are very disappointed with the following design changes: 1) The lifting cut out  in the back of the housing has disappeared, and you pretty much have to lift the unit by its handle. The handle was not designed for lifting and it could break. 2) The hold down window in front of the upholstery brush located above the bag compartment has been removed. No matter on how well we snap it into place, the upholstery brush keeps on falling off its storage area, and  we finally decided to keep it on a closet shelf. 3) The upholstery brush has been redesigned. It is now a flimsy plastic enclosure difficult to assemble, and held in place by two flimsy plastic clamps which I have already managed to stress after opening and closing the housing a few times. Although the new design seems to have been engineered to provide more suction, I am glad I kept the old brush when i threw the older machine away. 4) The clamps holding  the other accessories in back of the vacuum are a little flimsy and one of the accessories keeps on falling off. We will probably have to also keep this accessory in the closet. Only time will tell if this cheaper unit will function as well and as long as  our two previous Hoovers. On the plus side the lock that allows the upright portion of the vacuum to be tilted has also been redesigned and it seems to be functioning better than its previous incarnation.
it was the best vacuum I have ever had  We had this vacuum for two weeks before it broke. During those two weeks, it was the best vacuum I have ever had, and perfect for me as I am recovering from back surgery and needed one with no cord. Excellent. When it broke after two weeks, I called Hoover to use my warranty. They instructed me to take it to a certain vacuum repair store the next town over. I did and received a receipt and confirmation that the warranty was valid, and I would not be charged. It has now been 29 days that I have had no vacuum. The store informed me that they were never authorized to fix it, only that Hoover would send a new vacuum to them, for me. Since I do not drive, I find this whole experience very frustrating. Why could they not have shipped one to me directly? Why is it taking so long? I still have no vacuum, and when I called the store again today, and then Hoover directly again today, both told me they do not know when I will get my new vacuum, but that I will have to find a ride to take me to the next town (20 minutes away) to pick it up.  I feel Hoover needs a better system, and that Amazon should have been able to help me in this.
Do Not Order the Suggested Parts - Filter and Belts  The extra belts and filter Amazon recommends for this vacuum cleaner, and shows as a package purchase deal, are not the correct ones.  You will be sent a "F1" filter, which is twice the size of the one it needs.  The actual filter that fits is half the size, much smaller, and is an "F2".  Also when you opt in for that package, and the recommended 2 replacement belts, you will be sent 2 "Type 12" belts, which won't fit.  This vacuum actually requires "Type 15" belts.  The sad thing, you won't figure out you've been sent the wrong parts until you find or get an Owners Manual, which of course shows the correct parts.  Shame on Amazon for recommending the wrong parts with the purchase of this vacuum cleaner.
"It's annoying. But at least I get to say I have a Dyson so people know I spent a lot of money on my vacuum."  This vacuum cleaner is the most annoying one I've ever used.  I'll give you some pro's before I go into why it annoys me... Pro: It does have good suction and it's easy to clean out the canister. Pro: The ball design does seem to make it fairly easy to move around Pro: I get the confidence boost and bragging rights that come with having an expensive "status symbol" vacuum cleaner (sarcasm)  Ok, here's why I hate it: - The cord seems like an afterthought. The hook for it towards the top of the handle spins around on its own. So, I inevitably end up with the ENTIRE cord unwound and at my feet when I'm vacuuming. I've had much cheaper, less advertised vacuums that had retractable cords, or at least better cord management systems that didn't create an in-the-way, trip hazard of a mess. - In order to use the hose extension, you have to take all of the cord off the hooks. Yes, you have to pile the entire cord on the floor around you before you can release the hose extension for use. See comment above about how much I love having the whole cord on the floor around me. - The end of the hose extension is made of about 2 feet (admittedly, I haven't measured it) of solid plastic that does not bend. That means when I'm using it (with the overpriced brush tool I bought) to clean my couch, I have to stand 2-2.5 feet AWAY from what I'm vacuuming. It's cumbersome and feels stupid. And I have had the vacuum come after me and/or fall over during use of the hose extension, just adding insult to injury. Or the other way around, injury to insult. - Echo other reviewers' complaints about the mechanism used to lock this vacuum upright. I've had it fall over on me, or just decide it was upright but now it isn't anymore, SO MANY TIMES. It's like it "locks" upright, but never really LOCKS upright. You can never be sure what it's going to do next. - It feels like cheap plastic. In fact, the casing around "the ball" cracked randomly one day, without being banged into anything, so it actually is cheap plastic. - For some reason, when I empty the canister, I feel like I need to shower afterwards. Although it allows you to open the hatch at the bottom to empty, a lot seems to come flying back up. - It's ridiculously expensive, considering the above list.  For the price of the Dyson, they should have figured out these design flaws. For the amount of "design superiority" they tout in their advertising, they should have figured out these design flaws. These are really simple things that other vacuum manufacturers don't seem to have a problem with. The cons far outweigh the pros.
Disappointed  I bought this item because it was recommended by a pest control web site I recently visited. Their link brought me to this item.  It's hard to find bagged vacuum cleaners in stores, so I was happy to have found this one and I thought the price was unbelievably low.  Turns out the price and beautiful color are the only things I like about it.   The hose is way too short, like...why even bother with it having a hose if you can't really reach anything with it, why? The power cord is a nice length, but gets in the way while vacuuming.  I'm not thrilled with the way it vacuums bare floors.  There's no head light, no full bag indicator and when I try to lift it to move it, the entire top keeps coming off.  (note: It pays to read instructions, it really does.  Apparently two bolts are supposed to be installed, but mine only came with one).  It makes a lot of noise for no reason. It's like a child's toy and I would not recommend. I honestly think I paid too much for this item and I'm hoping it will hang in there until I at least complete the job that I purchased it for.
Worst Vacuum I've ever owned  Usually when a product doesn't suck that's a good thing. But not when you are talking about a vacuum. Don't buy into the Dyson hype from their commercials. You are basically getting a very maneuverable vacuum that doesn't work well. This is especially true for hard surfaces like wood and tile floors. Dyson's claim to fame is it doesn't lose suction, due to its powerful root suction. But what they don't tell you is the suction isn't good to begin with. The typical result when using the DC25 on hard surfaces is that it can't pick up heavy crumbs, coffee beans or anything other than paper weight scraps. Then when you turn it off, half the items it did pick up (like small pieces of paper or plastic) fall out of the brush bar. I've owned $100 vacuum cleaners that outperform the DC25. Sure it maneuvers well and is easy to push since it rides on a ball but at the end of the day, what do you buy a vacuum for? To pick up dirt, dust and debris and that's one critical aspect of this product Dyson seems to have ignored.
broken within 8 months  It worked fine, but I just found that I cannot open it to empty it.  It is stuck.  If I force it, I'll break it.  $49 down the tubes!
Screeching vacuum  As soon as this vacuum was turned on, it started making a noise that resembles a chainsaw. Way louder than a vacuum and blood curdling.  I was so disappointed I didn't even leave a review. Just bought another and used my broom until it arrived. I'm not sure if the noise is common or my product was malfunctioning.  Either way, I'm disappointed.
Great vacuum for tiny apartments  I got this on sale $50 as a second vacuum for our upstairs. it is by far the cheapest vacuum I've ever used. I can't believe that it's priced along with other vacuums at around $100.  First off, it was very loud. And maybe I just got a bad one, but the suction was not good at all. The vacuum didn't even leave marks on our carpet, and the carpet didn't stand up like it does when other vacuums are used. I wasn't even sure if it was cleaning. After several uses, the minimal amount of dust/debris in the bag told me that this thing had very little cleaning power. It should be noted that my carpets are not super thick or deep at all.  I took a loss on it, and resold it to a college kid who just needed something to run thru his apartment now and then. For that purpose, I'd buy it.
We got this 2 wks ago because of all the ratings and friends that have the same kind of dog we have. First time used it ever and did pick up a lot but the one to take out for smaller areas that can't be reach is not so used friendly of putting it back. Terrible. I said I'll get used to it for the money we paid for. Second time it didn't even work !!! Wasn't picking up anything.  So disappointed for 477 bucks and we had bad luck already.  Husband tried calling during their open hours no answer. So I'm done that's it. No more chances and it's heavy and LOUD. I was shocked !!! Sorry not for me !!!
Long term review  Bought this almost a year ago now, it has been okay.  First off, I own a GSD so dog hair is always around and needs cleaned up.  This did the trick at first and the bag less system works great.  After a while the it stopped working one day, found all the hair clogged up within the belt area.  Needless to say tore it apart and cleaned really well, but this still has to be done more often than I would like for a "pet" vacuum they should expect the hair and seal this better.  Short hair dogs this might work a little better, but still beware...and next time for the money I would dish out the extra bucks for the "other" guy.
WAY TOO LOUD!!!!  Very noisy, hard to use on carpet. Not a good lightweight vacuum.
Unreal Amazon Deal  I recently purchased the Dirt Devil UD40275.  I would like to tell you about how it worked, but I can't.  The vacuum cleaner took 10 days to arrive.  When it did arrive, there were no screws in the package.  I attempted to find the size of the screws but the manual referenced only "shorter" and "longer" screws so obtaining local screws was out of the question.  When I contacted Dirt Devil to obtain replacement screws, I was told that the model was manufactured over a year ago so they could not send me anything without sending them an invoice showing that I had purchased the item recently.  They further said that this is a discontinued item, and that I would be unable to obtain screws locally.  Really???  I went online to buy a Dirt Devil because I had such a positive experience with an earlier model. This has been a nightmare.  Beware!
Waste of money  This vacuum is very heavy, very awkward to use and the on board tools are totally useless.  The flex cord is much to short and if you try pulling on it to expand it, it will lift your vacuum off the floor.  The only good thing I can say about this vacuum, I don' t have to buy those damn paper bags for filters.  Would not recommend this vacuum to anyone.
Didn't like  I bought this for my hardwood floors and was not happy with it.  It didn't seem to pick up the lint, etc. on the floor very well. I returned it.
Shipping package cam damaged.  Machine assembled but does not work!  Terrible experience.  Just moving and will have service helping with furniture assembling try to help.  Will likely ship back as I believe a faulty product was sent while I paid about $260.  Awful experience that now sucks my time to solve!
don't buy  I bought my Electrolux oxygen ultra in Spring 2006, and as of Sept. 1, 20012 it is DEAD.  Estimated cost of repair is $175.  This is not a durable machine.  At the price I paid, I expected a durable solid machine.  What a disappointment.  Look at something else.
Second one in 2 years that the on-off button broke.  Bought the last one in August 2016 and March 1st 2017 will not turn on.  This is used for light residential use.
I owned for 1 year - poorly designed  Worked well for about 10months. The spinning roller has a metal octagon that has to seat into a plastic holder. Long story short, the torque ended up chewing up the plastic so now it is completely irreplaceable.  Height adjustment never actually "worked" if you look underneath at the design. If the redesigned the brush assembly with metal on metal and not metal on plastic, it would probably not be as big of a disappointment. Don't bother. It was nice when it worked, but the quality isn't there for a long term return on investment.
I should have done my homework better on this purchase  I should have done my homework better on this purchase, but it's basically a really clean looking mini shop vac. Since it would not be able to suite my needs it got sent back and am currently awaiting my refund. I still love amazon though.
Serious flaw on an otherwise fantastic vacuum.  I want to like this but there is a significant issue that stops me from doing so. The hinge on the door of the dirt cup is small and made of really fragile crummy plastic. It broke after being emptied less than 30 times. I cant for the life of my figure out why they chose to make this crucial part so poorly because otherwise this is a fantastic vacuum. It has a lot of height settings, a powerful motor for the brushes, an extra long cord, reasonable weight, decent capacity and it could suck the paint off your walls.  On top of it breaking so quickly the support I received for getting a replacement part has been less than great. I initally sent in an email requesting a replacement part, after hearing back in a few days and sending in my shipping info I didn't hear anything for more than two weeks even after sending in follow up emails. I ended up having to call to actually get the replacement setup and after a short conversation I was told that the part I need is on back order and that it would be more than a month before I might get one. To me this means that this is a common issue, as of 12/13 ive still not gotten my replacement part. I was going to wait until then to leave my review but I decided to go ahead and post.  Knowing what I know now I would not buy this again despite how good a a vacuum it is, if you do buy one be EXTREMELY careful when emptying it as that hinge can break at the drop of a hat.
Don't buy it!  I bought the similar model a few years ago and I hate it. The unit is VERY DIFFICULT TO OPEN just to change a VACUUM BAG! Once when I was selling my house and had a showing, I actually had to bring the vacuum to the Sears store so they could open the unit to change the bag, NO LIE. I can rarely get it open without a struggle. The hard floor head is way too small to make a dent in floor cleaning. When I complained about it the woman at the store said I could use the larger head w/o the brush setting, well, that didn't pick up squat. The filter in the back keeps falling out, no wonder there is a service phone # right on the back. It is also very difficult to attach/detach the beater head used for carpet. I've always had to have a darn manual next to me to try to work with this thing and it never works right. That said, when it really needs repair, I'll probably just trash it and get a Eureka like I had before.
Shocks  Every time I use my vacuum I get a shock from it when using it on carpets. I returned the first vacuum as I thought it was a fault but the second one does exactly the same.
"Reconditioned" warning  This was a reconditioned model (they don't make/sell them anymore!!) and the hose fell apart after we'd used it maybe 5 times! Husband is trying to find a way to fix it, but I'm guessing we will be taping it together just to make use of it. Poor workmanship somewhere along the line!
... I received didn't fit together at all and looked like it was already returned  The one I received didn't fit together at all and looked like it was already returned.
I had the prior model and was very happy.  After 6 months, the canister latch to empty started deteriorating and the plastic latch broke off. The wheel has a filter that a little knock will dislodge. Very unhappy. I had the prior model and was very happy.
My Dyson Experience - The Only Vacuum that Doesn't lose suction... what a laughable lie  Got one of these things, called "The Ball"... took it out for a spin. After 5 minutes of running, the 'cyclone' is clogged, at the top, with lint and the suction is gone. There is less than 1" of actual dirt/dust/bugs in the cannister. So I go dump out the cannister and raise a dust cloud which settles on the floor, near the trash can, which the cannister was lowered into while dumping. Back to the machine... and another 5 minutes, then dump.... 5 minutes, dump. Basically one room per dump... These are all oak floors which were vacuumed the previous time, a couple of weeks ago, with a Shop Vac, which, by the way, does not stop up.  On with the Dyson Experience....  ...another thing about the Dyson... every time you turn it off, then on, you have to re-kill the head brush motor... that sucks... Why not just LEAVE THE BRUSH MOTOR OFF?  The Dyson Dust Cloud... as one moves the unit during operation, the exhaust air, aimed downward, raises a dust cloud which settles in the area just cleaned. These are fine particles that are visible in bright sunlight. They billow all around the unit... How about an air exhaust that is aimed into the direction just cleaned, and not down against the reflective floor, causing a dust storm?  This clever plastic device has a reversible wand that doubles as the handle. You pull the wand out of the hose, turn the wand-handle backwards, and now have a wand off the end of the hose... clever in idea, sucks in practice, if you need to often switch back and forth... much hassle. The box picture shows about a 14 foot reach with the hose... and as Twain sez.. there are lies, and there are damnable lies... this is a damn lie, plain and simple. The motor unit always falls over or gets dragged when the hose is extended, and the hose is nowhere as long as is shown in the picture, when extended.  The unit itself is a wire trap... there are small hooky projections all over the unit that snag the cord.. another hassle.  When the foot lever is pressed to begin floor vacuuming, the unit leaps away from the lever press before the lever is pressed enough to release the unit into lay-back mode... so you have to pull the unit to the rear while pressing the lever... stupid, stupid, stupid.... How about a lever that is laid out so a simple toe press releases the head tilt?  Once the lever is released and the unit is in lay-back mode, if you need to pick the head off the floor, you have to reach under the body with your left hand, since the head falls almost vertical in the lay-back mode.... stupid, stoopid, stoopid..... How about a rotation stop that stops the rotation at a reasonable angle?  The instructions state to wind the cord counterclockwise, instead of clockwise.... probably due to the ass backward Coriolis in Australia.  The Low Clearance Tool was not supplied with the unit, but is available as an Expensive Option.  How completely stupid... Is there anyone, ANYONE?, who doesn't need to clean under a bed or couch?  All tools should be standard equipment... What about hard floor tool?  Another Expensive Option.  Conclusion: Dyson Ball highly maneuverable. Otherwise, pisspoor, sorry selection excuse of a vacuum cleaner...  furthermore, Dyson's bleeding heart story of how NONE OF THE BIG VACUUM CLEANER CORPORATIONS would buy his design, so he built it himself, and almost went into bankrupcy....oh my, how sad....But now is it a successful device, 10 million (maybe a 100 million?) units out there...bull*....  Now Dyson himself is a BIG MEAN VACUUM CLEANER CORPORATION that needs its own bashing..expecially the "hundreds" of Dyson "engineers" (claimed) who designed this junk pile.  Unit returned to Lowes........
Dyson products are not what their marketing team says...  I bought a Dyson DC24 Animal and at first was satisfied that it would do it's job but that didn't last long. I will give it credit for being quiet and light but that's about it. My first question is who in their right mind designs a canister release button to be the same button to release the canister trap door? I can't tell you how many times I have tried to release the canister to dump it out (which is frequently because of the small volume) and accidentally released the trap door spilling the contents all over the vacuum thus requiring a cleanup of the vacuum before continuing with the floor. This is such an obviouosly bad idea that I am at a total loss as to how this made it passed the design review meetings. This is design engineering at it's worst. My second complaint in the short length of the power cord. I can barely finish a room before having to find a new power outlet; certainly can't go down the hall and into any other area. My third and most frustrating issue is the quality of the build. After a couple of dozen uses and subsequent cleanings of the mechanisms, the agitator brush doesn't work correctly. The brush turns on at the push of the button but stays on for only about 10-15 seconds before turning off. It appears that the button (located just next to the main power switch) to turn on the brush does not stay depressed and is turning off the brush. I have to keep pressing the button every 15 seconds to get a few seconds of functionality. This appears to be another poorly designed and manufactured part. At a cost of USD500.00, this vacuum should be more better designed, more reliable and should last a lifetime. Instead it's just another piece of plastic junk that will wind un filling landfills inshort order. Based in my experience with this vacuum, I would never again buy any Dyson product. Dyson's Advertising and Marketing teams are telling us this is a superior product (and charging a premium for it) when in fact it is a far inferior piece of garbage. I'm going out and buying a well made vacuum such as a Kirby, they know how to make a vacuum cleaner! Goodbye forever Dyson!
Worst vacuum I have ever purchased.
Wash tank empties all over my floor  I got my floormate about 5 or6 months ago and i so loved it, used it 3 or 4 times a week and it did a fabulous job.  Now, about a month ago, everytime i turn it off, all the water in the wash tank runs out and is everywhere; thank heavens i can just vacuum up the water.  It is now unusable unless I want to use a sprayer to cover the floor with cleaner, then scrub and vacuum up the water.  i didn't buy this so i could do extra work and am very disappointed in the length of time it took for this to quit working, especially for what i had to pay for it.
very dissapointed  I had a previous version of the Dirt Devil Featherlite brand from about 10 years ago that was great.  When it finally died I thought I would try this one but was disappointed.  The suction on this vacuum was terrible.  Dirt just seemed to clog the hose where it went into the vacuum.  Also everything on it seems very cheaply made and assembled.  Very disappointed.
A sheep in wolfs clothing.  Mediocre product. Average floor suction. Heavy and cumbersome. Chord started to automatically roll back after a while. Unforgiving when trying to adjust it to the carpet thickness. Died after 20 months being used an average of 15 minutes once a week.
Would not recommend  I purchased this item in December 2006. Within two months it was dead. As it was under warranty, but too late to return to seller, I sent it to a Hoover repair center. They told me the computer had messed up and needed to be reset. In all, shipping and repair took two months. Now we are in Jan. 2008, just over one year from purchase. It has died again--I'm pretty sure it is from the same thing. I would not recommend that anyone buy this vacuum. Also, the bags are very expensive and hard to find. I have had to order all the bags online.
Adorable. But adorable doesn't clean your carpets.  I've owned this vacuum for around 15 months now. It was inexpensive (who wants to spend lots of $$$ on a vacuum?!) and small (like my apartment) and was nicely designed (it is adorable; what a sucker I am, no pun intended), and worked quite well for the first few months I used it.  Then the suction power started to decline to the point where now, after vacuuming a carpet, I have to go back over it and pick up by hand all the fuzz balls or little bits of paper or string left behind.  Uh, shouldn't the VACUUM be sucking this stuff up? If it's leaving behind all this crud that I can see, what is it leaving behind that I can't see?!  I was driven to write this review because I was just now attempting to vacuum my bedroom and, midway through the job, the machine simply turned off. Nothing will make it turn back on. In the past I've had it clog up, and after cleaning it it has returned to life, but it's not clogged, so Idunno! It's just dead. Not even a full year of good vacuuming. What a waste of $70 dollars. I would recommend saving up and spending a bit more on something that will LAST, or if it does break down is worth the cost of bringing it to a vacuum repairman. This thing just isn't worth it.  Also of note: emptying the dust canister is always messy. It sends huge billows of dust everywhere, and I end up sneezing for hours after. On more than one occasion while pulling the canister off of the body to empty it I have spilled the contents onto the floor. It's not hard to remove the canister, or tricky-in fact it's pretty easy to empty-but there is a certain level of coordination needed. Apparently I lack that?  If you need a vacuum for your doormats, then this is the one for you. If you need one for more rigorous uses, perhaps you might want to look at other options...
Don't bother  The pros: it does pick up dirt and is light weight. The cons: It falls apart. Why didn't they design it to stay connected? It is very hard to operate on carpeting. I have since bought a replacement vacuum. This is going to be donated.
I loved it up until the point where it just stopped working.  Disappointed in 6 months of use.expected more from Hoover.
Refurbished sold as new  After noticing that the tape seals were doubled over the previously open ones I inspected the vacuum closely, it appeared carefully cleaned and repackaged, but there were clear clues that it had been used (dust around the rubber seals, ...).  I assumed it was a glitch and arranged an exchange, but unfortunately the story repeated with the replacement: also a refurbished product. It does appear to be factory refurbished, which to me is even more appalling since it's sold as new.
should get No stars  suction isn't great, to use attachments you have to unplug the  hose and re plug it in that's a pain. when you turn it on you can smell dust . the filter is garbage, Even when a new filter is use the smell is there. Hoover you should stop selling this until you can redesign the filter system. Until then this is a dirt smudge on your company ....
Not worth the money  If you have nothing but hardwood floors, this might be a fine vacuum, but if you're looking to vacuum carpet of any texture, think twice. If you have a pet, look elsewhere.  My wife and I bought this vacuum knowing the Electrolux name from my childhood, only to find out it's a different company, and they're nowhere near the quality of the old '65 vacuum that my father still uses to blow out his pool lines (there's a novel use...).  Pros:  1. Quiet  2. Light  Cons:  1. Expensive  2. Bags are small and Expensive.  3. Proprietary design for hose and attachments (the two that come with it are all you'll ever get.)  4. Vacuum head and brush roller jams with the slightest bit of hair.  Let me get back to the attachments: If you're going to make a vacuum, give it more than a crevice tool and a brush, or at least make a set of extra attachments and sell those separately. The company has no plans to support further expansion of this hokey design.  I'm a bitter man about this vacuum. By way of disclosure, I should state that I have two golden retrievers and I may have been expecting a bit much, but for a vacuum over $400.00, I should see better performance... The vacuum's been fixed twice now when the head siezed up and stopped spinning the roller. At least the warranty location is good about helping me out.  Really... there are better tools than this one for the money.
This proved to be the worst money ever spent  This proved to be the worst money ever spent.  The release for the handle broke the first day, The rewind has to be slowly hand fed in, The rotating head did not work it just rolled on the floor from the day we got it it due to being too tight in the housing.  It did free up over the next few months but then the suction dropped to such a level it will not pick up anything.  Taking it to the dump I spent more gas than the vacuum is worth.  I will never, ever purchase another eureka product again.  Simply put I hate this piece of junk!  Be warned if you buy this product you will regret it.
The worst vaccuum. No suction. It does not clean.  This vacuum is absolutely awful. I was given this vacuum last year to write a review on my website.  I was so excited for a new vacuum. My Dyson was getting old and this was to be the replacement.  I was being paid for a positive review and I wrote one because it worked the first 3 uses.  (I have stopped writing on my website and have closed it down so I feel this review is necessary.) Then it stopped working. Here is why this is a waste of your money. There is NO suction. The hair and dirt clogs almost immediately and emptying it once or twice during a single use is a requirement. The brushroll "self clean" - Nope. Does work. You have to slam on the brushroll button extremely hard and maybe it will catch. Tools option - Complete joke.  There is no suction through the tube. It actually makes a bigger mess. I just pulled it out to give it another shot and it emptied all of the hair that was supposed to be in the container. ALL OVER THE FLOOR. I pulled out my 11 year old Dyson that is on it's last legs and it did everything the Eureka can't. PLEASE PLEASE Save your money.  Use a different vacuum.
Terrible machine  The expendable tube retracts while using the attachments.  Aboslutely useless.  I bring out my old tank type for accessories.  What a watse of money
Wouldnt recommend  We've had this less than a year and have had nothing but problems. First, the powerhead would no longer "lock" in place. Then the handle on the canister got stuck in the down position so that the handle was no longer usable. Parts of the plastic on the powerhead have broken off. Then today, the powerhead died completely so I can no longer vacuum carpet. OVERHEATS like crazy and can only vacuum one room at a time, have to wait for it to cool down between rooms so it's usable. Only upside is that it does do a good job getting your carpet clean, if its working! Would NOT recommend!!
You better live on one floor  It is too heavy.  You better live on one floor.
Disappointment  So disappointed! I loved this machine and cleaned it as instructed after every use but the fact is I used it 5 times and it doesn't work right anymore. Throws water everywhere and the suction is nest to nothing. I gave it 2 stars only because I love the concept!
Not good for daily use  We bought 4 of these to test them out amongst a few of our cleaning staff. We were looking for a small, reliable, and powerful vacuum to use when we needed to vacuum crevices, stairs. or hard to reach areas. We had hoped to use these as backups to our primary commercial grade Orecks. While there are some features that we liked, all of our staff that tested these agreed that they did a poor job.  We liked that the unit is portable and lightweight. Initially suction seemed really good but after VERY light use, suction seemed to disappear. We changed the bag. Nothing. Checked round "filter" cover. Nothing. Checked hose to ensure no clogs. Nothing. Hooked hose up to use the unit as a blower (as advertised). Nothing. The unit was unable to blow pet hair during our testing. In the advertisement they show it blowing tree leaves....I don't think so.  After calling Eureka, we went through a bunch of baloney so that they could "diagnose" the unit over the phone. Eureka staff was polite but unwilling and unable to help. The 1st rep told us that they would replace the unit for us and that they would process our claim and get back to us in a couple of days. When they got back to us (as they promised), they said that since we used it for commercial use (VERY light residential use, less than 2 weeks old) they couldn't do anything for us. They said the 1st rep was mistaken. Again, they were polite and friendly but simply unwilling to reason with us.  We had high hopes for these units as the reviews are generally good. I loved the attachents, cheap bag replacement cost, large wheels, and length of the suction hose. It's to bad that the units worked so poorly.  We just returned 3 of the 4 units. I would not recommend this vacuum.
Died within 2 weeks.  Died within 2 weeks.  My first Dyson lasted 12 years.  This model, died almost immediately.
Scrubber? More like a wet/dry vac, that's all!  After cleaning my large area of ceramic tile floors, I could tell just by looking at them that they weren't clean. I liked the idea of scrub brushes, thinking they would do a good job of scrubbing the tiles and getting them clean. I don't think the brushes even touched the tile! I saw no traces of scrub brushes on the floor, the brushes were just as clean when I finished as before I used this machine and my floors were definitely not clean. I kept looking to see if there was an option to lower the brushes based on what type of floor you're cleaning, but there isn't. To see just how clean (or not) my floors were, I took my swiffer mop and mopped several different areas where I had already cleaned with this vacuum. Gross! The white pad on my swiffer was so dirty! Like I hadn't even cleaned at all! What a waste of time and effort! I should've just used my swiffer! It does a way better job than this vac! I was just hoping I wouldn't have to resort to that. It's a lot of back breaking work to use a mop on the amount of tile I have.  I'm still searching for a good ceramic tile floor cleaning machine. Until then, cleaning it on my hands and knees is really the best machine around. :( Very disappointing and frustrating.
Find a better machine  Way too noisy and did not do the job for the money...went to a Shark!
I'm extremely disappointed with this purchase  I'm extremely disappointed with this purchase!! We've owned this vacuum less than a year and have had it at the repair shop 4 times. It worked great when we first brought it home. Then after a short while, it would get extremely loud, hot, and shut off. I have cleaned all of the filters and taken it apart to make sure there are no clogs anywhere. The vacuum still continues to be very loud and does not have good suction at all. I had MUCH better results buying the $60 dollar vacuum at a local store than I have had with this more expensive vacuum. I gave this vacuum a 1 star because 0 stars wasn't an option. What a waste of $300!!
This is a better version of the truly horrible useless Swiffer vacuum  This is a better version of the truly horrible useless Swiffer vacuum.  If your house is clean, this will do a fine job on small daily messes.  If your house isn't clean, this will do a barely adequate job.  When I got this, it had been raining daily and the cats and the hubby going in and out in the rain and mud...my house floors weren't clean.  I thought it did a great job, till I kicked the cat's water dish, and had to use a towel to wipe it up and the clean towel came up dirty.  Th good? Wow, it does vacuum the heck out of the solution, picking up kibble and hair.  However...it's SO LOUD!!!  It needs a light on the floor so you can see.  Other negative?  There's no way to not have to take this apart to clean it, and if you don't, it will smell.  I tried to use this as a vacuum alone...meh.  Frankly, it's just easier to use a mop and bucket, and it does a better job.  Especially if you have a washable mop head....
Works Great ... perhaps too good!! Beware!  Started out loving this machine. We thought our carpets were filthy because at every twice-a-week vacuuming the dirt cup would fill half-way. Over a couple of months we noticed a change in the feel of our carpet. It was becoming shorter than when it was new. I discovered it was due to the tremendous suction of the vacuum ... the machine has no mechanical adjustment for height of the head. It has two settings for different carpet ... one for short, another for deeper pile. The setting for deeper pile opens the suction flow to lessen the suction so the head doesn't sink so deeply into the carpet. Alas, it was deep enough in the carpet to shred the top of the pile, thereby shortening our entire carpet. The stuff in the dirt cup was not just dirt, but shreds of our new carpet. I relegated the machine to the garage and bought a Hoover Windtunnel. Much, much better results. Bill Winter, Michigan
Lacked the suction I expected from an Oreck. It was also very clumsy to handle. i returned it.
did not last!
annoying and messy dirt cup  I had always used a canister type vacuum but this was so highly rated that I decided to try it. It was awful. Weak suction, annoying and messy dirt cup. I wished I hadn't gotten rid of my old Hoover canister that they don't make anymore. I ended up getting rid of this bad vacuum when I found a great deal on a Dyson at The Home Depot.
Clogs easily. Shoots more stuff out than it sucks up  Didnt last 6 months. Caught on something and started smoking the first few weeks we had it. Clogs easily. Shoots more stuff out than it sucks up. Just threw it in the trash, very disappointed it didn't last long at all.
I wouldn't buy it again.  It's fine for a quick run over the no-pile rug, but it does not pick up stuff from my tile floors.  I had a Bissell sweeper before this that worked ok, but died right at 12 months old.  I should have learned and bought a different brand.  This is truly a dust buster on a handle and you can't expect more...It's not worth the money.  I also don't like the way you pull the filter out of the dirt cup and then empty it.  It's not a clean process.  The filter also holds on to dust and makes it difficult to actually get it clean enough to feel like it will be efficient.  The only plus is that the battery seems to last just long enough for me to run over 1000 sqft.  I am editing to say that I really regret that I missed the window of opportunity to return this appliance.  I hate it.  It does not clean the floors.  You can see stuff on the floor (crumbs) and vacuum over it several times and it will still be there. If you hit a bump or try to pick up a slightly larger item that it doesn't like it spits out the large piece of (a narrow 1 inch scrap of paper) and along with the paper came a lot of stuff that I had vacuumed up already.  It makes a huge mess.  I so wish I had purchased a different vacuum.  I had read many reviews and thought I was making an educated choice.  I hope you choose better than I did.  I will add that my previous sweeper was a Bissell.  It was a much simpler model. It performed adequately, but died after 18 months.  i thought I was spending more money for an upgraded model that would perform better and last longer.  I will not buy another Bissell.
wtf  So I got this because my dog chewed up my other.  Well heck the brush spiner dosent spin on its own its spins as its pushed. Witch means it dosent pick up anything unless its lightly laying on floor.  What a waste of my money .
not good condition
Fire hazard  The unit worked well for a couple months, and by then I thought the only flaw was a 10 pound brush motor head that on top of a 3 feet pipe feels like 100 pounds. With all the force exerted on it have loosen some of the plastic on the control handle and stuff went haywire. The brush motor stops running until you wiggle it, then spark sounds, molten plastic smell and very flaky function. I called Hoover(bad bad customer support) they say my newer S3765 model is not under recal for fire hazard(only S3755) and even though I describe these symptoms they don't seem bothered at all, tell me to go look for a repair shop to fix it under warranty. I really don't have time for all this trouble, should have put another hundred bucks and got a Dyson.  Stay away.
Disappointment  Vacuum was heavy, very loud,  hard to maneuver, a nuisance to assemble, and did not work properly; I had to return it.
Worse vacumn cleaner. No suction
Frustrated  I just purchased this vacuum yesterday (November 2, 2009)  I used it last night and this afternoon.  Already the automatic rewind feature is unusable.  The unit is indeed heavy and awkward to use. I agree with the other reviewers that it has great suction and pick-up ability, but the fact that it is not very user friendly is why I am going to have to return it to Costco tomorrow.  I also made quite a mess trying to empty the canister.  The extra hose just makes the unit more awkward.
Good at first  I got this 2 yrs ago and at first, it was good. The suction was great. Although, it's heavy and I don't like that. The attachments don't stay on well...I have lost most of them. But after a little over a year, the suction isn't as good and it blows stuff around...also, there is something wrong with it, as soon as I step down to release the handle to vacuum, it has this horrible loud noise! The beater bar must have something wrong with it. Because when I do my hardwood floors and turn off the beater bar, it doesn't make that sound. I wish the hose was longer too. Oh well...we are finishing our basement and I'll just use it down there until it dies and I'm looking for a new one for our upstairs.
Days on dc 39 vaccum  Poorly built, very poor performance. I ordered through Costco and returned after using once. Got Shark for less than half the price and love it.
A poor excuse for a vacuum  Whatever you do, don't make this your primary vacuum. It has no guts and the hose attachment has not worked in months. It does not suck anything! I have to go over areas 6 times to get something as simple as cat litter off the carpet. I am not sure what the deal is, but this is a very poor excuse for a vacuum. You really get what you pay for. and in this case, a little less.
not good for dog hair  I hate my hoover, would love to replace it today if I could afford it.  Does a terrible job on low pile carpet and on bare floors just blows the dog hair around.  I had bagless and want it back!!!!!!!!!!!!
Overall ok. Shorter cord than I would like. I have to plus it in room to room and the hand held part (which we use tons) is child height I have to bend over to use it and it is awkward to put back in holder. Ok but would opt for another model when we need another one.  Update this has fallen apart ... after a few months the tube has started to split apart, tried duct tape ti hold it and it would only tear in another spot, also the part that connects to the handheld part completely fell off. Never again would buy a Bissell, we just replaced it with a Shark hope they are better than this one.
especially because of the good reviews concerning picking up cat hair  I had high hopes for this machine, especially because of the good reviews concerning picking up cat hair.  It works great on bare floors as does my $12 stick vacuum. On both high- and low-pile carped it is a spectacular fail.  My old $40 Eureka beats it hands down.  Unfortunately it takes more time and effort to return it then I have available.  Having been disappointed by several purchases, I won't be buying much from Amazon in the future.
This item came broken. The backbone didn't fit to the bottom which made the canister not fit which made the hose part not work. Also missing the hooks to hang the cord. Wheels had given me a horrible time trying to get replacement parts for it with terrible customer service.
Definitely not what I expected  I expected great performance from a $500 -$600 dollar vaccum. I discovered there was a lot of hype, and little reality to their claims. .  It broke after 3 months of fairly light usage.  Dyson was willing to repair but not replace it. The repair is expected to take about two weeks, possibly more, till completed. Over all, I've been very disappointed.
don't buy  bought in march 2018 and it died aug 2018 substandard the whole time
very disappointed. was very lightweight though I must  the one i received had no suction at all. very disappointed. was very lightweight though I must say
Very Disappointed  Purchased the Electrolux Precision  shortly after I made another Exectrolux purchase and thought it would have the same quality.  I was wrong.  After month one, small plastic parts begin to fall off or break.  Annoying but still no major problem.  Ending month 2, the suction does not operate correctly.  After I cleaned every possible option, remains the same.  It appears a internal plastic part that transfers the suction to the hose has become stuck or cracked, or .............?  Not worth the 300 cost.
Great for a one-time use.  Worked great for the first use, but after that, it stopped sucking. It appears to clean but then spits everything back out. We clean it after each use, including the canister and hose.  It is easy to assemble and very light-weight but overall very disappointed.
Issues began after 4 years of normal use  We purchased this vacuum in December 2010, based on favorable reviews in a consumer magazine.  We initially appreciated the power the vacuum had, the HEPA filter, and the Powermate pet accessory.  However, after approximately 4 years, the vacuum started falling apart.  We had the following issues: 1)  The handle would not sit upright on its own, as it is top heavy and the hose pulls it down.  In other words, you had to lay the handle on the floor if you needed to pause vacuuming, otherwise it would fall over and potentially damage itself, you, or your furniture. 2)  Probably as a result of the above, the plastic connector that links the two stainless steel hose sections began to crack, and eventually failed.  It is thick, yet flimsy plastic that cracks easily and can't support the weight of the handle or the force of vacuuming.  I fixed this with duct tape and 2 hose clamps. 3)  After 4 years of normal household use, the vacuum became extremely loud and started tripping breakers in the house.  It emitted a strong electrical smell and was very hot after short periods of vacuuming. 4) After 5 years of use, we took the vacuum into a repair shop because we were concerned about creating a fire hazard, and learned that the motor was shot, and replacement was more than the cost of a new vacuum.  Sadly, the days of a Kenmore vacuum lasting decades appear to be over.  We decided to purchase a different vacuum brand and hope that it will last more than 5 years.
The power drive belt comes off every five minutes.  This is a piece of junk.
average  This thing does not work as good as other machines at less cost. Parts started coming off the first 3 week.  Hose extender does not stay on and plug retractor came apart first week.  The air valve is a waste and should not be part of this unit.  The hose should just un plug if needed.
Dont bother with this vacuum  Just bought a brand new Bissell Lift Off, Multi-cyclonic, Pet hours ago, and am in the process of packing it back up to return to Best Buy. We have a chow mix dog, sheds like crazy, and this vacuum isn't anywhere near up to my expectations. We still have our old Dirt Devil vision that is in need of a brush roll bearing, but it appears parts are no longer available. The Dirt Devil is three times the machine as the new Bissell! I wouldnt be so dissapointed or critical if we had payed 60 or 70 dollars, but for $179.00 I expect something comparable to the old Dirt Devil. The handy dandy brush roll attachment worked for less than a minute before requiring dissassembly for hair removal, and after three times of thoroughly going over the same area with the main brush roller in the base, I still get considerable dirt and hair. It must be pushed slowly and multiple passes made to perform even a mediocre job. I would not recomend this vacuum for anyone with pets, and for the price not at all.
I was not overly pleased with this vacuum  I was not overly pleased with this vacuum. After having a shop vac for many years that I loved, it went out on me one day and I decided to go with this due to it's product description of being compact, (which it was), lightweight (which it was) and the bagless kind of appealed to me also. However, I had to dump it often and bagless is ok but not if I spend more time cleaning the filter to get the suction it starts out with. Then the dust flys around while I am cleaning the filter which kind of contradicts the purpose of the having a hepa filter to reduce dust and allergens getting into the air. Also it was a pain that while I was vacuuming, the wands would come loose from each other and I had to keep pushing them back on or if they actually fell off each other, put them back on. I sent this back and ordered another shop vac like the one I had. At least the last one lasted me for 10 + years and I had no issues during use.
Won't pick up cheese on hardwood floor.  We just picked up this title beauty today at Bed Bath and Beyond. Went home and assembled it in about 5 minutes or less. Then we gave it a test run. It seemed to do well on on rugs but then we tried to pick up some spilled taco cheese on the hardwoods and it left some behind even after a few passes. We then decided to test the suction and to our surprise it barely has enough power to hold a dish towel in place. We then tested this little beauty in the master bedroom where our mischievous little pomeranian chewed off a couple of beads from a pillow. Unfortunately, the Rocket was only able to pick up about half of the beads scattering the others on each pass. This machine is light, well put together and maneuverable but it is without question underpowered where it counts most, suction. It is being returned tomarrow.
not good for hard floors  Even though it has high or low speeds, I have not liked it for hardwood floors and for tiles. On wooden floors it gets things from the front and throws out from back and you feel that you have not vacuumed the at all. Even on carpets I have observed it does not clean evenly. I have a dark large sized rug and I can see the clear marks where the vacuum leaving the fine dirt in lines. On light colored carpet we can not see this.
NOT WORTH THE MONEY - BUYER BEWARE  I can't believe this vacuum sells for more than 50 bucks and has the ratings it does. I am completely in shock. I've owned this vacuum for a few years now and have also used my in laws vacuum for the same amount of time, which is the same model, so I know I didn't get unlucky with a bad one.  I will start by saying that there are two good things about this overpriced hunk of junk. It's lightweight and it can get under furniture pretty easily. The upright part can almost drop down to the floor while still vacuuming and maintaining contact with the floor.  Now for the bad. This vacuum has two modes, high and low. High is for carpet and low is for hard floor or low carpets. Both modes do a poor job. I have a dog who sheds a LOT and a wife who sheds almost as much, and I'm always finding hair leftover from the vacuum on the floor. If used on hard floor, like tile, the vacuum sometimes shoots things behind you instead of sucking it up. After several uses I find myself disassembling the beater bar and the whole bottom assembly to clear out clogs and hair that bog everything down. After 6 months of use our vacuum makes a really loud noise and I suspect the bearing is shot on the brush bar. When trying to get the edges where the carpet meets the wall I usually can't get it to suck anything up. My in laws vacuum is falling apart, and though I can't say if they take care of it or not, I care for mine more than the average person would and it's falling apart as well.  On top of the cons listed above, this vacuum has no hose or hand tools.  Bottom line, you're better off saving your money and buying a cheapo. It will perform the same. This machine is NOT worth 300 bucks. I would NOT recommend it to anyone, ever. We are in the market for a new vacuum and will probably be going for a Dyson. Hopefully it isn't junk like this.
Does not work!!!! Faulty material and shoddy work. Does not line up.  Does not work. The two pieces that incorporate the wash container and the cleaner do not line up so no cleaning fluid will come out or be sectioned in. I am not pleased!!! Let's see how customer service is as I have filed a complaint. There is a quarter inch gap where the top cleaner container is supposed to line up so no suction.
Cleans better than a mop!  This machine arrived 3 weeks ago. I used it for the first time last week.  I like that I gets the floor clean, the floor looks shinny and clean.  Now as far as cleaning the grout absolutely not.  If you use the scrub, don't even bother it does not scrub anything. dirt that you can get off with your fingers or keep going over with a mop and the dirt will come off, mop and finger works better. Don't believe that you will not have to get down on your knees and scrub and clean because you will I don't know if the floors (inside the grout looks clean because of the water and cleanser. After cleaning the ceramic floors with which was installed over a month ago. I wet a cloth and wiped the floors. Dirt! I think the mop and Hoover does the same job except the dirty water going into it's own little space.
Defected power head  When I first used this vacuum I had to lift the power head off the floor to get the brush to turn. After a month the brush would not start at all. Spent over a hour on the phone with customer service. They had me take it apart to check the belt, then transferred to another rep who put me on hold for another 20 minutes. He wanted me to take it apart again to check the belt, like some thing change in the 20 minutes I was on hold! After an hour on the phone he told me to return it while I still could. Waste of money shipping a defective product and a waste of a hour of my time.
Not worth the money  Worked ok for about 20 minutes then the hose got clogged and the water container started to leak for no apparent reason. Shut it off packed it up sent it back.
Warranty expired and so has vacuum  I liked this vacuum at first because it did a good job of cleaning both carpets and hardwoods. However, the more I used it, the more inadequate it became. The bagless feature with the filter is annoying because it has to be emptied (a very messy job) more than once when I vacuum the whole house. It feels like one could buy a new filter after each vacuuming! And the dirtier the filter gets, the more often you have to empty the canister. Additionally, the roller bar began to give me problems and when that would stop working, it was impossible to get the carpets clean. The motor has not lasted and now that the warranty is up, my vacuum repairman is telling me it is just not worth it to fix all the problems with this thing. Bottomline is-- I have basically rented a vacuum (for $70) for the past year, which has worked so-so. Don't buy this if you want a reliable work horse that will last longer than a year.
Do Not Buy This  I have purchased many Dyson products and this is one I would never buy again. I purchased it "refurbished" from Dyson via Amazon.  The wand was broken when I received it. They wanted to charge me for a new one and it took 10 days to receive it.  Not long after I started having issues with it running for a few minutes and stopping.  Dyson has sent me two new batteries, and new main body assembly.  Nothing has worked.  Each time I had to wait yet another 10 days, although the last round I paid out of pocket for faster shipping out of total frustration.  I have continued to tell Dyson over and over that it still does not work despite trying their suggestions for trouble shooting multiple times.  I have requested a replacement machine and they keep replying with the same suggestions for trouble shooting that does not work and will not address the fact that I do not have a working DC35.....  very disappointing.  First review I have ever written in my life....  felt I need to do so to warn others.
This vacuum cleaner didn't work for me...  I have three cats and one dog. I have an area rug that is semi-plush. This vacuum cleaner did not pick up all the hair like my hoover did. What I did really like about it was the noise level was very low and it was light. Too bad I had to return it though because it didn't do the job as I needed.
Junk  I bought one last month from Kohls, came broken on 2/19/18 to return it,  wrote a review on Hoover.com did not get posted.  Order a second one from Kohls, come today, took it out of the box put it together, tested on thin carpet not even 5 minutes brushes were not turning, then it smoked, smelled like burned rubber, nut fell off from the bottom.  Absolute junk.
bad product  doesn't work very well; put some pieces outside, really hard to use; I need another and I don't recommand this product at all; it's not normal to sell those kind of bad products!!!!!!!!!! A shame!
Terrible vacuum  Crappy scrappy vacuum, didn't even last 3 months worthless, don't waste your money
Crap  First time I used it the cord retract broke.  I has an annoying whine when you use the rug attachment and was clumsy to use.
Heavy, poor construction  Have been using this product for about 18 months now. It is quieter than most other vacuum cleaners that I have had in the past. Taking that into account there are a number of flaws with this product. 1. Very heavy 2. Weak handle that broke off in 6 month, and now again and I had to order replacement. Handle construction is made of 2 pieces of plastic (not solid), and when turning this heavy vacuum, unless very careful it will break off. 3. Belt tore after 3 months 4. Short power cord (even comparing with my previous Hoover) 5. Must clean filter every month or will experience severe loss of suction 6. Someone else mentioned, that emptying canister is a pain, because the red tube piece constantly falls out. I don't review many products, but wanted to let others know that this one they should probably stay away from.
BROKE DIRT DEVIL  it broke I have not had it 2 months and just vacuuming regular carpet would rather buy a broom DO NOT RECOMMEND
It is only 5 months and it doesn't work. I Have  only used igt 4 times in my summer home. Now ,it doesn't,t even turn on.  It is only 5 months and it doesn't work. I Have  only used igt 4 times in my summer home. Now ,it doesn't,t even turn on. I tried everything a the little fellow doesn't respond.
TERRIBLE!  This vacuum doesn't work well at all! It's hard to roll back and forth. It gets clogged up way too often preventing it from sucking up dirt. This vacuum is barely powerful enough to clean up crumbs your child leaves after eating a cookie.
Problems  Have now had this for a few months, and we started noticing a while back that there was always dust on the actual vacuum... Turns out, it has some sort of seal issue where it actually shoots dust out the hose when you're using the floor setting. All the big stuff gets picked up but dust and dirt get shot back out. My Roomate actually threw it out of the house because he said it was aggravating his asthma, and went to target to buy a new one. ... My original statement was true, for about 2 weeks. - Super lightweight - almost unbelievable so. When you put it together it does feel really cheap but then when you turn it on, it works as well as the $350.00 vacuum we just broke. Great suction, though I can't speak for how long that will last as we just started using it. Has all the attachments you really need and it's not complicated to empty. Would definitely recommend, especially for the price.
Very poor suction.  cheap,cheap, the pull cord broke after 5 uses. Very poor suction...Don't waste your money....
Lightweight but otherwise not recommended  Pros: it's cheap and it's lightweight. It more or less does the job, if the job is light vacuuming.  Cons: Canister is messy and inconvenient to empty; hose is oddly situated and connection is inexplicably inconvenient; you must remove several screws on the bottom of the vacuum to replace the belt; just doesn't do the job with pet hair and heavier dirt.  With two dogs (one of them a long-haired, sheddy golden retriever), three children, and a yard full of leaves and other bits of trees, ours is not the easiest home for a vacuum. I'll admit that. And after killing two $300+ vacuums in as many years, I decided to go the cheap route and kill a yearly $50 vacuum instead. The previous model to this was a Hoover (now discontinued, of course) that cost about $50 at Walmart and did an admirable job for over a year. When it finally bought the farm, I toddled off to Walmart again to choose a new one, and came home with this model. Unfortunately, it has fallen far short of its predecessor. I'm off to shop for a new one again just a couple of months after the purchase.  Every time I open the canister to empty it, quantities of fine dust drift down from the upper portion and coat the vacuum cleaner itself and the floor around it. More often than not, I find that clumps of dog hair and bits of leaves have gotten stuck in the upper filter, which when removed cause even more junk to tumble out onto and around the vacuum. All too often, the hose itself gets clogged with dog hair and must be laboriously cleared. This happened occasionally with my old Hoover, but usually only when my husband or son vacuumed up chunks of dog toy stuffing; and I've already had to do it with this vacuum cleaner as many times as I ever did with the old one.  The hose is weird. The part that attaches to the waste canister sticks straight out of the back of the vacuum before turning upwards, which is not a real problem, per se.... just... weird. At least that end of the hose has a decent connection, with a little twist-and-click action. On the other end of the hose - the end that is pulled free to use attachments - there is no such connection. It just pushes down into the tube on the body of the vacuum. If pushed down a bit too firmly, it can be very difficult to pull out again, since there is little room to fit fingers around it at the base. I've knocked my knuckles too many times pulling it out. Why no easy-to-operate connection at the end of the hose that is most frequently connected? Danged if I know.  Another difficult access point is the roller belt. You must unscrew several (5 or 6) screws and remove the whole bottom of the vacuum to get at it. With my old vacuum, you just flipped two toggles and lifted up a panel - five seconds to access the belt vs. the five minutes it takes with this one (always assuming I can get my hands on the proper screwdriver!).  All in all, this seems to me a poorly designed machine and I very much regret buying it.
Seemed to work  The vacuumed worked great for the first use on my bedroom floor. A couple of weeks later I go to vacuum again and the belt snaps in half. Hoping this is just an issue with the belt and not the vacuum itself. Will redo this review if a new belt doesn't do the same
Lost all its OOMPH, now looking to replace.  Bought a vacuum after years of being satisfied with only sweeping because we got a dog who sheds like crazy and our one rug (5'x9') was getting impossibly gross.  This Bissell was okay for the first few weeks, though a bit annoying -- limited volume capacity, need to manually clean out the filters every.single.time.  Then it seemed to take longer to charge.  Now, after six months of use 1-2x monthly, it looses oomph about halfway into cleaning our rug, both audibly straining and visibly leaving dirt and hair.  ONE RUG.  It does a little better if I ditch the chassis and only use the hand vac...but the whole point of getting a vacuum is to *not* have to crawl around on hands and knees manually suctioning every inch of this (very modestly sized!) rug.  TL;DR: Started okay, lost its oomph, we're unhappy with it and looking to replace.
Nice proformance, but neck snapped after three weeks  There is just one reason I didn't give this amazing vacuum five stars.  The reason is because of the tube between the handle and the body of the body of the vacuum broke after just three weeks.  My husband was helping out by vacuuming the den, when he didn't put the vacuum all the way in the upright and clicked position, causing it to fall over.  When the neck/tube hit the wooden coffee table, a distance of less than 2', the tube snapped in two!  We tried to glue and tape it together, but it doesn't hold.  After scouring the internet, the only replacement part we could find is on back order, with no timeline when it will be in stock.  So what do we do?  Borrow a vacuum until the placement part is in stock or buy a new vacuum and toss a $180, three week old vacuum?  Such a pity because it did an outstanding job cleaning the carpeting, was easy to empty and light weight.
stopped working after 2 months!!  I bought this just 2 months ago and it died today! i was just sweeping like normal and all sudden died.  With normal use of 1 to 2 times a week.  Not happy and hope customer service will make it right,
Would be perfect IF......  I love having the vacuum and steamer in one machine.  I've had this device for about 7 months.  At first I loved it.  Now the romance is over.  It gets on my nerves.  Maybe it's the 7-month itch?  I purchased this one to use downstairs on hard floors and berber carpet. I also have a Dyson.  I know a lot of people want to know how it compares.  PROS 1. Suction is pretty good.  I didn't notice much difference with the suction between this one and my Dyson (WHEN & ONLY WHEN THE FILTER IS CLEAN).  2. Nice having one machine with interchangeable heads.  Takes up less space.  3. Is very light!  Can carry with one hand.  4. The width of the vacuum head is the same as the width of a step, so I can vacuum my steps with it.  It's difficult but is a lot easier than using the wand.  5. The steamer is pretty nice.  I've been able to get up a lot of stuff on the floors and my floor looks amazing.  It really gets up the grime and it's a lot easier than scrubbing the floor on your hands and knees.  We've only used distilled water to make sure it does not get calcium build up in it.  CONS Short Cord The extension cord is way too short!!!  I cannot vacuum a whole room without having to find a new plug. With the Dyson I can vacuum the whole downstairs, but not with this.  It's pretty frustrating.  Filter At first it took awhile before the filter needed to be cleaned.  Now I feel like I have to wash it more often.  Just so you all know, it says in the instruction manual that you have to wash it once a month so it requires some maintenance.  The suction is awesome when you first use it after washing it but the suction quickly goes away within a few uses.  Then I have to wait a whole day while the filter dries before I can vacuum again.  With small kids, I sometimes have to vacuum up a mess more than once a day.  I'm considering purchasing another filter but that's more investment into a machine that I don't know how long it will last.  It should come with 2 filters to help the consumer use the filters as it states in the manual.  Wand too short -- CAN CAUSE INJURIES! I curse every time I have to use the wand.  It is too short!!!  It is horrible.  It is pretty much useless because it won't reach where I want it to.  Sometimes I want to use it to vacuum crumbs off of the table or the counters but it will not reach.  Even to use the wand to pick up crumbs on the floor a few inches in front of me is too far.  Anytime I try to use the wand the vacuum falls over and I have tried everything to keep it upright while using the wand.  Even if I hold the vacuum down, it still manages to fall over at some point.  It really is a hazard and people can get hurt using the wand.  Canister, not for those with allergies The canister's design is not the best.  On the Dyson and other vacuums I've owned, all the dust comes out into the trash and you never touch the dirt.  With the Shark the hair and dust gets stuck around the disk in the canister.  It's hard to describe, but basically there is a huge dust/hairball wrapped around a post & disk that you will have to touch....every...time.  The door also opens with such force on the canister that many times the dust goes flying off and then I have to revacuum around the trashcan.  Will only pick up stuff head-on, sides don't have enough suction As I mentioned, I use this vacuum mostly on hard floors.  When vacuuming under the kitchen cabinets, it barely sucks the dirt from the sides.  This gets complicated when trying to vacuum a corner.  So then I end up having to use the short wand and get whacked in the head by the toppling vacuum.  Picking up cereal If you have kids, you will probably want to know if it will pick up cereal and baby puffs.  It kind of does.  If you go over the piece of cereal several times and try to pick it up head-on then it might work.  It takes about 3-4 swipes to get it to pick up.  Sometimes it appears to have picked it up but has not.  So what do you do?  You reach for that @#$% wand and the machine falls on you no matter how hard you try to get it to stay upright.  While I think the concept of this vacuum is great, I wish that it had a little better design.
Couldn't give it a ZERO  This was the biggest waste of money  The circuit board that controlled the brush died along with the useless lights in the first year.  $50 to replace.  Did they offer warranty replacement - NOPE.  Fantom - "No longer supported this model"  So I did it myself  If the dust bin is sparkling clean it has good suction, if not  use a broom.  I will say that the handle/wand is a great idea but with no suction, no pickup.
Disappointed in the product  The wand is awkward, floppy and inefficient.  It does not work properly.  Very disappointed.
Poor ergonomic design and abysmal performance  If you're looking for a cheaply made,  poor performing vacuum but looks neat with its colorful shiny plastic exterior, this vacuum is for you.  Very difficult to maneuver and frequently trips over itself with its two main wheels and swivel front wheel. Suction is poor, even with frequently emptying the canister and keeping it clean.  The last Dyson upright I owned had a couple of plastic parts which failed and was cheaper to buy a new vacuum than fix the old one.  Do your research and buy a reliable, well made vacuum like a Miele. It will cost about the same as a Dyson but will last.  Dysonwhere an educated consumer is their worst customer.
This is supposed to pick up garbage, not BE garbage  I know I'm just adding my voice to the choir, but don't buy this vacuum. You'd be better off with a good, hard-bristle broom. After just a few months of use, it pushed away more dirt than it picked up. It began to make the worst noise (and I made sure the filter was clean and the brushes were clear). The hose pops out constantly and peppers your legs with grit and funk. It's one of the worst purchases I've made. The only good thing is that I'm only out $45, although I would have preferred to spend that money on something else!
The vacuum is very loud and the attachment hose is very thin plastic. The hose will NOT stay in the attachment bracket. If I would have seen the vacuum on display in the store I wouldn't have bought it.  It does clean the carpet very well. This vacuum is not worth the money!!!
I like this product  I like this product. It only lasted a year and the suction motor locked up. I did take good care of this unit and should have lasted longer than 1 year!
DONT BUY! DOESN'T FOLLOW WARRANTY  DO NOT BUY!!!!! I haven't even had my vacuum for a year and it isn't working. The vacuum comes with a warranty... but they don't tell you that when you call their customer service line THERE IS NO ONE THERE TO ANSWER IT. Its just a recording saying to call bad during the normal business hour 8-6, which  I have been doing for the last THREE BUSINESS DAYS! I can't believe there is no one to answer their phone. I NEED A NEW VACUUM. There is nothing worse then horrible customer service.
Vacuum broke after five years  At first the vacuum was user friendly, light weight and quiet. Then the belt started breaking more often. After five years, everything changed. The vacuum felt heavy to push, became super loud and difficult to use, and pretty much started to fall apart as it is made of plastic. So this machine last between five to six years for the price. Other vacuums have lasted longer.
Bissell Pet Hair Eraser not meant for high volumes of pet hair  For the cost and quality of this vacuum it is not worth it.  Pet hair gets stuck up in the container and you have to take it all apart frequently to get all the hair out that is wrapped around the filter. It is easy to take apart but a little difficult to put back together.  Also the hose and different ends do not work well and the hose comes unattached while vacuuming all the time. There is an attachment with a spinning brush, I used it a few times and the brush will not spin any more.  I have to replace the belt monthly no matter what setting I use. Bissell's customer service suggested the brush was set too low so I changed the setting, it still needs the belt replaced all the time.
works great when works too bad they have a fatal flaw  Hoover has issue with turning on.  Have had 2, both same issue within 1 yr.  If you buy keep your receipt.  Hoover service makes you take to a repair location & then sends replacement - also broke... Done with these.... works great when works too bad they have a fatal flaw...check online, I'm not the only one wit this issue.
It sucks, or doesn't  I've had my Dyson DC07 for four years, and I never liked it.  I'm not a slob, and I only have one dog, so is a minimal amount of suction too much to ask?  I've called the company to see if maybe I got a lemon, but they dismissed me quickly and gave me some lame pointers on how to check the suction path to make sure it wasn't clogged (it wasn't).  I "sucked it up" for the next three years (I wanted to scream each time I pulled it out), but recently, the motor was screeching and the "magically spinning dirt" stopped spinning.  I took it to a well establisehd vacuum repair shop, and the owner said they hate Dysons there.  Three of the seven refurbished for sale models there were Dyson.  The owner said that they are going to start charging more to fix Dyson vacs because they are so difficult to work on.  For the price, the quality was absolutely not there, and I feel so ripped off.  I will say that it is quite easy to take apart to clean, but who the heck cares if it's not doing it's job anyway?
The worst vacuum cleaner you can get  Where to start.. Just a really really bad product. The suction power is horrible. the floor looks worse after using it. And it takes forever to clean. Wish i could have returned asap as i received. I'm nor sure where did the good reviews come from ?
You bang it on the side of the waste bin, and it doesn't come out  Is everyone on crack? How can you not be having the same issue I am having? Emptying this thing is a nightmare. I have to reach in and handle the gunk myself with my hand. You bang it on the side of the waste bin, and it doesn't come out. So I end up with dirt dust everywhere, and I have to wash my hands afterwards, and then I have to whipe down the canister..as it is covered is dirt dust from fiddling around trying to empty it. This is the worst design ever. Yes it sucks stuff up..but the mess of having to empty it is worst than anything.
Arm weight  Doesn't pick up hair, lint, green light is a fake.  No on board tools means the belt slips when you switch...and then you have to redo the entire area to try and get suction for the edges.  Pushing it around gives arm workout which is the only benefit.  Best use is to put on the curb for the trash guy.
cheap plastic, leaky  Hopeless thing. This is my first steam vac and worked great intially. but after 4-5 uses, problems started appearing. Water tank is made from cheap and fragile plastic, it broke and had to replace with $50. Detergent keeps leaking all the time, hardly able to use. Brushes also stopped working. DON'T BUY THIS.
cheap product, keep your $ 500.  Very cheap product, you feel is going to break when in use, suction is ok ,but quality is very poor(plastic so thin and fragile) , not worst the money.
it sounded like a lot of people were happy with their purchase  I purchased this vacuum after reading the reviews, it sounded like a lot of people were happy with their purchase.  When the vacuum arrived it had great suction and seemed to really get the carpet clean.  However after 2 months of use the foam filter would clog constantly and it needed to be cleaned out which was gross.  Now the vacuum doesn't work at all.  Terrible product, would not recommend.
Awful vacuum, don't buy!  I had done a lot of paper shredding, and I used the vacuum the first time to pick up the many pieces of shred that were all over the place.  Even with more than a half dozen passes, it missed a ton of the shreds.  Even worse, it pushed many shreds forward rather than picking them up, and regurgitated other shreds it had picked up.  I'd thought Bissell was a decent brand.  Based on this experience, I couldn't be more disappointed.
You don't want this one.  The Shark Professional must be made for men because first its ridiculously heavy, 15.5 lbs, and all of the weight is in the body and handle. After vacuuming my arm hurts. The suction is fine but not any better than the best Bissel or Eureka. The design is flawed. All the weight is in the upper part and the foot has 2 wheels too close together so it tips over a lot. Try to turn with it and it tips. Try to walk it backwards and the wheels wobble. The cord is extremely long and that would be fine if you're vacuuming a huge room or a hotel lobby,  but in normal size rooms the cord gets tangle or stuck on furniture and its impossibke to navigate tight spaces. It gets caught under the wheels and if you're not careful, caught under your feet. Theres too much of it and it doesnt automatically retract. You have to wind, wind, wind it on two hooks. Stick with the vacuum companies that have been in business 100 years. They know how to design a vacuum for the home. And they're half the price. If my husband didn't proudly purchase this it would have gone right back to the store. And guess who does the vacuuming?
Too loud  The noisiest vacuum I've ever used.  IT SCREAMED! It picked dirt very well, but I returned it two days later.
Hoover WindTunnel MAX  Not at all impressed with this vacuum. When I first plugged it in and used it it blew smoke everywhere and something was burning in it. My husband managed to tinker with it and get it working fine. It works well, but the bin where the dirt is held broke one of the first few times that I emptied it. The bottom piece fell off and broke and now won't stay on. I can't recommend this product.
Disappointed  I bought this model because I really wanted something to take care of pet hair.  I don't have a lot of dogs, and the ones I have are not long-haired.  (some pugs and one mixed breed medium-hair large dog).  This vacuum clogs all of the time, more than my old Kenmore. It's been 2 years now and we are constantly having to turn it off and pull out clogs.  I had such high hopes, especially for something that is clearly labeled for pets, but based on my experience, I would not recommend this vacuum.
it's very limited  I bought this like others to replace my original full dyson.  What a disappointment.  The cord is shorter, the emptying process is messier, and most of all it has no where near the suction power or cleaning power.  What is worse is that I called customer service and the guy said, mam you are right you bought a vacuum for light pick-up that an apartment not a home calls for.  I ask why that wasn't described on the box and he said good idea....  Anyway, the original big dysons are good but heavy not easy to lug around up steps etc.  This one is light and easy to handle and that is about it since you have to go over and over the floors you exert just as much energy...just more time!
A cheap piece of junk  I returned this item after using it for one day.  This is a cheap piece of junk.  An assembly of overly complicated, poorly designed plastic pieces whose sole purpose is to break - forcing you to buy another vacuum or purchase replacement parts.  The motor was strong and generated a lot of suction.  However, that is irrelevant when the rest of the contraption is unsuitable for actually cleaning anything.  The roller mechanism, which is powered only by the air flow -  is useless on carpet.  Yet the roller head is too narrow to be much good on hard floors either.  The accessory attachments are 3/4 sized and again, fabricated of extremely cheap plastic..  I reiterate - don't buy this vacuum.
Not the Electrolux you're familiar with...  buyer beware. the electrolux company that has been doing business in the united states since 1924 has sold the copyright to the name and is currently under the names "aerus" or "lux". go do your research and you'll see what i mean. the 'since 1919' deal that this company mentions means the company has been known as electrolux overseas since then. they are a sweedish/chinese company. not sure why consumer reports gave this machine such a good review. it has decent suction but wow...the parts are VERY cheap. the hose feels cheap. no service stations to get your warranty honored (you've got to mail your machine off which will cost you in shipping). set this machine next to any aerus canister and decide for yourselves. don't just read reviews. go out. look. compare on what you've seen and you'll see what i mean.
Dead at age one and a half  I was so happy with this product until last week.  The suction power is awesome, the dirt tank is a little small, but over all, I was quite content.  In fact I was just about to review this vacuum and rate it 5 stars until the controls quit working.  I bought this vacuum in March of 2010.  200 and some dollars and it lasted 18 months.  I looked into fixing it but the entire hose piece would need to be replaced to the tune of 130.00!  The vacuum repair person I spoke with said that Hoover USED to be a good brand of vacuum until they were bought/merged with Dirt Devil and now these vacuums are made in Mexico and the quality has plummeted.  Save your money and invest in a better brand.  This unit is just a jilting lover.
Good for arm exercises  This is a dud.  Buy only if  you need arm exercise because anything heavier than pet hair will not get picked up on the first swipe- and popcorn kernals may take 4-5 swipes.  Total disappointment.  It is thin and lightweight, but that is all one can brag about.
Worst vacuum cleaner EVER!  I owned a large Dyson upright for 10 years until the extension hose broke.  I thought I would replace it with this smaller, lighter model.  "Never loses suction." That's because it never had any.  I should have returned it immediately, but waited too long and the return window expired.  So I am stuck with a vacuum cleaner that doesn't clean.  Now the button to control the brush no longer works, so it is useless on carpet.  Save your money.
Recondicioned Review, Not New, And It Shows!  Reconditioned means like new, this unit was substantially marked down, but there was major scratches and damaged to it. I own 3 Dysons this exact one I bought new, a DC 24 for my boat, and this one. I love Dyson and when I find a deal I wanted a backup. This was a lemon I guess, I will attempt to contact Dyson and see about the 90 day warranty because these items are bad/wonky The sides of the ball rub the case. The wheel in the brushed squeaks. The canister seal isn't even close to sealing It smells like it is about to catch fire or is melting plastic. I gave it 2 stars because it is a good price for a Dyson and it still could suck a golf-ball thru a garden hose, assuming it doesn't catch fire first!
but it's TERRIBLE on carpet  It works well enough on hard floors, but it's TERRIBLE on carpet. It doesn't even look like I vacuumed, there's still tons of pet hair and other items in the carpet. Really unfortunate because it was really expensive.
Junk  Had this thing for over a year. I have used it maybe once every two weeks. Clean the filters after each use. Now it shuts down after 5 min. of use to cool off. Suction is poor as well.
Dont buy  Omg! I had this thing for a week and the roller bristles no longer rotate and the the device no longer sucks up anything.
Worked good for a year or so  Then once it got clogged up inside it was worthless. I had a great time smashing it apart to fit in my trash bin.
Sucked and not as stated  Shall be rather honest here used the product just once, thats one time and when I went too used it again it didn't work. No harm nor foul, Ill just never purchase Bissell again
This is the second Eureka Boss Smart-Vac that I have owned.  Compared to the first one bought around 2008, this unit is unacceptably noisy with a high frequency shrill comparable to fingernails running across a chalkboard.  Ear protection is needed when using this vacuum cleaner.  Next time I need a vacuum cleaner I will look elsewhere.
Value but not quality.  Meh - you get what you pay for with this product for sure.
Waste of money  Used this vacuum twice and it broke.  Waste of money!!!!
This Unit Has Quality Defects.  POOR QUALITY:  Bissell has issues addressing their defects.  Purchased this unit and should have known there would be issues when I took the unit out of the box and the belt was off.  No big issue, I repaired it my self, but then when using this vacuum I started seeing black scuff marks on furniture and baseboards, where I had bumped the vacuum into these items.  I contacted Bissell only to be told that this was my issue.  I should not go near any items but then get an attachment to vacuum close to the base boards.  The issue is there bumper not my operation of the vacuum.  I kept contacting Bissell with the hopes that they would respond and correct the defect but I received repeated excuses, including:  Use an attachment to we have contacted the supplier of the bumper and are waiting for their response.  This last one was after two months.  I guess it takes a long time to get a response from China.  Until Bissell can address their quality defects (Belt Off and scuffing walls).  I do not recommend this product to anyone.
Doesn't operate on carpets.  Seems to have awesome suction but is incapable of being used on carpets that are not glued down, runners and area rugs. The hose is too tight and doesn't extend easily allowing the machine to tip over. Therefore it is useless and should get negative 5 stars.
Missing parts, looked used  I'd rather spend the money on a new one. There's no tile & grout brush? Instructions said supposed to be included with this "select model".  The "wood floor brush" looks USED/WORN. There's hair in the brushes and elsewhere. It's dinged in places and the power button looks fragile. I will not buy the missing parts ($40) bringing the price of this manufacturers refurb, $20 or so less then a new one, they just better send a new one.
broken in less than a year without heavy use
This product does not work as advertised. Wish I had sent it back for a refund, but I kept trying to make it work. No hose attachment also means no cleaning in tight spaces or along edges. It is also VERY loud!
Shreds belts EVERY use. DO NOT BUY.  Truly awful. Shreds the $8 belt EVERY SINGLE TIME I use it. Horrible.
Inferior vacuum cleaner claims suction as only redeeming feature  This vacuum cleaner suits the person who cleans my house, but I find it hard to use, very noisy, and have had to replace the belt a couple of times even though it is relatively new. I think of it as a pile of mostly plastic junk.
Brush roller has never worked properly  I'll never order a vacuum cleaner on-line again.  It's too much bother to return it once it's been assembled.  If I had purchased this from a store, I would have returned it.  The brush roller only works with a certain amount of pressure on it.  It will not spin freely when the vacuum cleaner is being pushed across the carpet without releasing some of the pressure on the roller by pushing down on the handle (which lifts up the front of the vacuum, the part in front of the roller).  I read on-line about some internal belt that frequently needs adjusting on this particular unit to keep the roller spinning.  I took it in for repair, but the repairman couldn't correct the problem either.  I have had good luck with Eureka in the past, so I suspect this is a unique problem with this particular model.
clogged  it gets clogged too easily; i have had to go to extreme measures to keep it from clogging. other than that it has good suction and is easy to clean aside from clogging issue
disappointing  I just returned my miele jazz after only 2 uses. I purchased the miele to replace my dyson animal, which worked well for two years, but has seemed less effective recently.  PROs of the miele jazz: Very easy to maneuver (swivel movement like a dyson ball), low front end that fits easily under cabinets and furniture with a low profile (like dressers and sofas), super quiet, powerful suction, beautiful job on carpets and hardwoods.  CONs: On my second use, a piece of the plastic underbody of the machine started dragging and impeded the use of the vaccuum. The front of the underbody of the machine is metal, but the middle and back plate is a very lightweight bendable plastic. The piece that was dragging on my machine was a small tab of plastic, next to the left wheel, below the pedal. There are two of these plastic tabs, one on each side, next to each wheel. The other features that I wasn't crazy about: the hose is too short to vaccuum a full set of steps -- you need to support the vaccuum on a step while you work with the attachment to make it all the way up or down, the vaccuum is on the heavy side, and the handle was a bit uncomfortable. I consider these elements minor, and would have happily lived with them for the cleaning performance of the miele.  Ultimately, for the price, the miele should get many more miles. I returned my miele for a refund. I think the design of the bottom plate with the two flimsy plastic tabs is problematic and I would not recommend purchasing this vaccuum unless you can be assured of a full refund from the retailer.
Not a good vacuum  I had this for 5 years then sold it for $50. It really isn't very good. When I first bought it I thought it was good. I bought into the whole "Dyson" thing. Gradually I noticed that it was not picking up very well. I called Dyson, I cleaned the filter, still bad. I woke up and went on Youtube and typed in "vacuums" and then "Dyson".  Wow, I learned a lot and realized that I was correct in my assessment. I found out on Youtube that Dyson was a piece of garbage. The best vacuum was "Riccar". They run in price from $500-$1,500. Next, I went to my local Vacuum dealer. His business is all about vacuum sales and repairs. They have been in business for 40 years.  The owner told me that Dyson was complete garbage. All vacuum dealers know that. People who make a living repairing vacuums know this.  If you want to know about cars ask a car mechanic. If you want to know about vacuums, ask a vacuum expert.  I bought the Riccar Radiance. It retails for $1,100. I got it for $850. This machine makes the Dyson look sick. There is absolutely no comparison.  Check out youtube then go to your local vacuum dealer.  Another great vacuum is Sanitaire. It retails for $300. It is also 10 times better than the Dyson or any Hoover.  Also, I used to be a big believer in Consumer Reports. Not any more. I still read what they say, but I take them with a grain of salt.
It started off great but now it's terrible  I've had my vacuum for about 6months. It started off great but now it's terrible. I'm already looking for a new vacuum. I have one dog...a lab, so she sheds a lot but doesn't have super long hair. Now the vacum pushes the hair around and doesn't suck any up. And yes, the vacuum bagless thing is empty. I have always emptied it after every use. So, if you want a vacuum to maybe last you six months then this is your vacuum
mine was a lemon  this does not work.  the machine stops when the handle is released and there is no release of water in any position. the scrub brushes spiral but no water is coming out the bottom.  i went through a lengthy troubleshoot with hoover folks.  after she admitted to having no idea how to fix they blamed the fact that i had put a chemical/fragrance free soap (a few drops) with a splash of vinegar.  i have an immune system disability that requires i use no chemicals.  they claimed that because i did not use their product the machine is faulty.  this is ridiculous.  i have had other machines and used products other than the corporate brand and they worked fine. they would not replace.  the only solution is to take it to san antonio (from austin) to a repair shop or ship it back at my expense.  the reason i bought it was to wet vac any chemicals/fragrance that may have come into the house via the floor.  i aired this out for several months before using.  taking it in to a shop will contaminate my machine.  i told her that i would chunk it.  too bad--i researched extensively before i bought it.
Gave this to my mother as a gift. And she said that something broke within the first 24 hours.  She said after vacuuming one room the brush became tangled and stopped turning. I should mention that my mom is an elderly retired woman who lives alone with no animals and is extremely tidy.  She said that she had issues with the the attachments not working properly. Had to return it.
Great suction, but I ran over the hose the first time using it, and it got thrashed.  With any other vacuum I've owned, it was never a problem to ride right over the cord. Either this one has an over-zealous suction or a cheap cord, or both. Now I have been on hold forever with Hoover to get this resolved.  Also, the plastic is cheaply made, so I guess you get what you pay for.  : ( I should have listened to my husband and gone out shopping for a vacuum rather than buying one online.
Died young  It died after 2 years.  Very expensive bags, very cheap and inefficient accessory tools.  Not worth the money.
Horrible scratches on my hardwood floor!!! Beware, use with caution  I bought this item because it has pretty good review. However when I first used it on my hardwood floor, I realized left messy scratches on the floor!  My floor is ruin because of this vacuum. It says you can use it for hardwood floor but clearly it has design flaw.  The bristle brush on the vacuum is so tough, it resembles those that you use to scrub your bathroom floor. Even rougher than that!  I was trying to inspect to see what was scratching my floor and it took me a while to figure out what was wrong. A few trial and error, a few more scratches on the floor...and finally I realized the small rubber padding near the brush has grid designs on it, and a very very tiny rock...so tiny it's like seasalt get stuck in between the grid.  That was what scratching my floor.  I almost have to use magnifier to spot it!  Now that I removed the grain, it vacuums alright, but everytime I use it, I fear it will leave undesireable scratches on my hardwood floor.  I might replace or remove the rubber padding, perhaps will put felt on it to raise it up so it won't scratch my floor.  I suggest if you are going to use it on your nice hardwood floor....check the bottom to make sure no little rock or grain stuck on it. Or you will be sorry.
not recommend  Worked good for one Week ... I wouldn't buy it again after just one week that thing broke, tried to use it and it would not even start wasted my Money
CHEAP CHINESE PLASTIC  Cheap  chinese plastic  plastic  wheel assembly  broke  just  over  a  year .. not  covered ...  JJUNK
Disappointing product  Does not clean well on tile even with special tile cleaner. Be prepared for a work out with this baby.  Heavy and cumbersome. Would not recommend.
NO SUCTION!!!  Wanted to love this little vacuum but it is basically useless.....unless I am doing something wrong the Kenmore blows it away.
This three-year old vac is as creaky as a senior  The problem with these reviews is that people submit them too soon. I loved this vacuum at first. I mean, compared with my 20-year-old Hoover it was incredible. The more I used it, the less I liked it. The design is tippy, the hose split after 2 years, the multi-angle dusting brush just pushes the dust around, and the large power brush has never worked (terrible design). Worst of all is that the canister is almost impossible to empty without spilling. One of the stronger selling points was supposed to be the warranty -- I've replaced the entire unit one part at a time, and it's only three years old. Each replacement part took too long to arrive. Maybe I ought to start ordering the replacement parts ahead of time to prepare for the inevitable equipment failures. On a positive note, it IS good on pet hair, and it's light enough to be easily carried up and down stairs.
I read so many great reviews on this and I really hoped I would love it, however  I have only had it a little over a year and it is literally falling apart. The hose has a big hole near the nozzle where it separated, one wheel is dragging and it stopped sucking. I don't have a huge home and I only use this vacuum every few days so it really comes down to how poor quality this machine is.
This is JUNK - you have been warned.  Junk.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  I purchased it in November 2017 because of a leak I experienced in my first floor living room ceiling.  After the clean up was handled by an external company, life intruded and I wasn't able to use the product until this weekend.  It puts down water, scrubs, but doesn't suck up the water.  I had to get paper towels to mop up the dirty water on my kitchen floor.  I am soo glad I did not try it on my hardwood floors first. Not worth the money.
I really wanted to like this  I have owed Hoovers for years.  When the old one started burning through belts, I found the WT II with the lifetime belt.  "Brilliant!" I thought.  I thought wrong.  This vacuum is clumbsy, roles poorly on any surface, and the gaskets don't seal well so all of the superfine dust falls behind the collection box instead of in it.  The plastic hook that holds the hose broke first time out.  For $300, it should work better.  I should have spent $400 for the Dyson-- anyone I know with one loves it.
I was surprised how much of this vacuum is just cheap ABS plastic held together with cheap ABS plastic tabs.  This morning, I hit the ejection button to force the dust bin to open and the single plastic rod the diameter of a pencil lead broke, popped off and shot across the room.  The other vacuum cleaner manufacturers have caught up to whatever Dyson thought it was doing so well and are half the price.  I would not recommend this vacuum to anyone - it is an utterly overpriced and overhyped piece of plastic made and assembled in China.  Get two or threeEurekas, Dirt Devils or Hoovers for the price of one Dyson - leave them unopened in the closet and when the first one failed in 5 years...you have a ready replacement. I knew spending hundreds of dollars on a single vacuum did not feel right - but I did it anyway.  Don't make my mistake.  Dyson may be British - but this is just overpriced crap made in China (like everyone else).
Does not pick up hardly anything.  Suction opening is only about 2 inches wide. Donated to second hand store after 1 month.
Amazing bang for your buck. Edit: Never mind!  Most parts of this vacuum were modeled directly from Dyson. Especially the bin, hose, and filters. Suction is excellent - pretty much on par with the Dyson Ball, to my surprise. Attachments work great. The hose latches in using the same latch as, you guessed it, Dyson.  Only cons are - it's a bit louder. It uses a belt. It is cheaper looking (the quality of the plastic itself). For $100 I can't complain. EXCELLENT vacuum.  EDIT: Unfortunately, after a few months use, I am changing my review from 5 stars to 1. Maybe I just have a dud, but over the months the motor has become so loud that it actually hurts my ears when used in hallways or areas where the sound can bounce off of walls. It's so loud in fact that my ears are still ringing right now. Going to try and get my hands on a decibel meter to take a reading before I contact Hoover. This thing is pretty much uncomfortable and unsafe to use in its current state. It's a shame, because it is otherwise a surprisingly good vacuum with great suction.
Too many cons!  I purchased the DC25 2 weeks ago at Target. It was my first and last bagless. We have 2 heavy shedding dogs and this vacuum came highly recommended and reviews were awesome. I'm returning it tomorrow and going back to the Hoover Wind Tunnel.  Pros: Picks up VERY well.  Cons: Cord is way too short - long enough for one room only and my home is not large. Dog hair sticks to the containter and had to bang it against the trash can to get it out. Dust and hair then flew everywhere! No extension attachments to get under tables with.
Don't buy this if you have wood floors  This is my 2nd Dyson vacuum.  It works OK on the carpets but performs terribly on wood floors.  There is barely any suction and it only pushes the crumbs around, it does NOT vacuum them up.  I end up using a swiffer duster instead.  Don't waste your money.
Too much mess and low reliability.  The bagless dirt container fills really fast, I have to dump it every 10min on carpet.  that is a messy process as there are lots of little holes that fill with lint and dust so they have to be shaken or brushed out.  After 6 months the brush belt started coming off the metal axle that drives carpet brush.  Little piles of plastic shavings fall out every time I put the belt back on.  This is not practical compared to vacumns with bags to hold the dirt.  I was surprised that Consumer Reports rated this so highly when it does not hold up and it not easy to dump out the dirt.
