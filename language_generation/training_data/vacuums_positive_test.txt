The BEST Vacuum I have ever owned!
Love this vacuum - as much as one CAN love a vacuum.  After many weeks of vacuum cleaner research through both Consumer Reports and the reading of product reviews on various sites (Amazon.com included), I finally took the leap and purchased the Hoover S3765-040. It is terrific! To see what has come out of my carpeting when I thought we were reasonably clean people has been quite eye opening. It is powerful, efficient and thorough. Changing out the various tools is extremely easy and they operate very well. I do agree with other reviewers that it would be handy if the dust bin held a bit more.  I find that it cleans carpeting as well as it does hardwood floors. Switching between the two is very easy as is adjusting the suction strength. I find that I use different strengths between hard surfaces and carpeting. All controls are right at your finger tips.  Although I have never owned a canister vac before, I am very pleased I made the change from an upright. This vacuum gets a big grin and two thumbs up from me!
Best Vacuum I have Ever Owned!  Love, Love, Love this vacuum.  Have a central vacuum system installed in our house that i will never use again.  This vacuum picks up everything and you can actually see what you are cleaning.  Easy to use, easy to empty, easy to move around.  Highly recommend this item.
Eureka 4870MZ Boss Smart Vacuum--SUPERB BUY!!!  This is a GREAT product ... easy to use and then put away in a corner... highly recommend this vacuum!!!
Amazing. Not sure how I've survived without this  Amazing. Not sure how I've survived without this. Cleans very well and easy to use!! I was amazed at the water and stuff it picked up!!
green clean machine  Exactly what i was looking for. I have mostly hardwood, with a couple of carpeted areas and a huge indoor/outdoor rug that collects art projects debris and snow/dirt. This has a lot of suction, lightweight amd very easy to maneuver.  We couldn't figure out a couple of the attachments.....will need to open the manual.
Another Excellent Machine from Hoover  After 10 years our original wind tunnel Hoover lost its suction so we replace it with this latest model. It never ceases to amaze me how much dust and cat hair this removes from the carpeting. The instruction manual gives detailed, illustrated instructions on how to break down and clean out the interior of the machine, as well as how to remove, clean, and replace the filters. All in all, an excellent vacuum cleaner.
Thats one of the best vacuum cleaners out in the market at a competitive price!! nice job Shark!! keep the quality at optimum level !!
REALLY SUCKS!
Works great  Works amazing. Been trying to find something to make my floors shine and this does great.
Very Satisfied!
Really Sucks  I recently purchased this vacuum and it performs better then i expected. the self propelled feature works well on carpets with little effort. Consumer reports gave it one of there top ratingsas well they should. I also purchased the 20 foot extension for stairs and longer reach places without moving the vacuum whhitch makes it very easy to clean. I would recommemd this to anyone who is lookig for a good allround  vacuum.
This vacuum is the best for pets. It's not lightweight, but works as advertised.
Bought another one - very good  has a nice small head so it gets around tight places in the RV.  Lightweight; easy to clean; I've bought two so far.
Best little vacuum ever!!
Great suction power and portability  It's a great little vacuum cleaner for getting closer to the wall edges, corners and steps! I use it to supplement my full-size vacuum cleaner that can't easily get to the small areas. It actually has more power than my full-size. Unlike other comments I read about the cleaner, I found that the power cord and hose are both plenty long enough. I'm very glad I bought it!
Excellent choice loved it
Get this vacuum!  This vacuum is great! I was really surprised by its power!  I needed a lightweight vacuum that would be easy to access underneath bed, bureaus, etc, and this is perfect!  Great on hardwood and carpet!
LOve our hand vac  LOve our hand vac! Easy to use and very handy around the house, battery lasts long and good for an entire cleaning of the house! Has great functions and easy light weight to move around...our 10 year old uses it with no problems! Its great
It's very lightweight and it works really well I have a dog and it gets all the dog hair up. Love the fact that I don't have to buy any vacuum bags I could just pop it open empty it done.
excellent , could not be more satisfied it was just as I expected ,, Smooth glide and does an excellent job
cleans my tile floors much better than mop and is easier on the hands.
Awesome Vacuum  This unit replaced a 23 year old Kenmore whose hose was held together with duct tape and the plastic had yellowed.  That vacuum was still going strong but when we moved, I decided it was time for a new one.  We love this new vacuum. The suction is so powerful, there's nothing this thing could not clean.  The attachments are great and easy to use.  The price was a great value.  For a canister vacuum, it is very lightweight and best of all, the power head is very maneuverable, allowing you to easily get to those hard to reach places.  Overall, an excellent vacuum.
Great vaccum... does everything but mow the lawn
better than any other vaccuum i've ever used  at first i was very wary of this vacuum, because of the price. i mean, what could possibly be so special about this vacuum that it costs so much money?? i have 3 long haired cats and a baby, so i vacuum every other day and this thing picks up way more stuff than i ever could imagine is even there. i've had it for over a year, have not had ANY issues with it. other vacuums i have used always got clogs in the hoses because of all the cathair, or would eventually just lose suction all together. this vacuum may be very expensive, but it is worth the investment if you have animals, or even if you have bad allergies. it is not heavier than a regular vacuum, and because of the expandable hose, it is very easy to vacuum stairs and to get those cobwebs in the high corners of the ceiling. the canister that collects the dirt is easy to empty by just releasing a clip. definitely better than having to shake it upside down over a trash can (creating a big dustcloud), which was the case with my dirt devil. i would definitely recommend this vacuum to anyone who has animals.
Great Value  I bought this vacuum cleaner mainly for my stairs and hardwood floors in my home.  It's really lightweight and does a fantastic job.  I have two cats and you can imagine the cat hair collecting everywhere.  With the broom half of it would just fly around the room.  The vacuum is straight suction only which is perfect for hardwood.  It has more than enough suction.  As a matter of fact, the woman who cleans my house had me order one for her house.  She especially loved how she could sweep under the cupboard ledges in the kitchen and bathroom, something her Shark couldn't do.  The hose is also quite long.  I am able to go halfway up the stairs without moving the vacuum. The only carpet this vacuum sees is what is on my staircase, so I will not comment on it's ability to vacuum carpets.  But it picks up cat hair like no tomorrow. I also use pine pellets for my cat litter.  The big draw back is they break down into sawdust.  This vacuum picks them up easily.  The only real negative I've seen with this is the bag looks small.  But, I've had it two months and haven't had to change the bag yet.  Then again, I live alone and do not track much into the house.
Dyson DC39 Animal Canister Vacuum Cleaner, what great litttle vacuum  When I first opened my box and looked at my new vacuum I thought this can't be any good. It was so small. How wrong I was. This little vacuum is so powerful, lightweight and easy to maneuver. I have a cat and a dog so the power is really lifting the dirt and animal hair better than any vacuum I have had so far. The bonus is not having to buy bags. I would highly recommend this vacuum.
What an amazing machine  What an amazing macine  I have tile floors in kitchen, bathroom, and entry way.  To tell you the truth I really wondered  if this was going to give you clean floors.  To my surprise it cleaned them to exceed my expections.  Not a mop can do good  this good of a job. So out the door went my bucket and mop.  After I was finished the floors had a brightness to them.  If anyone is wondering if it cleans ground in dirt, it will take it up.  This is a excellent product and would recommend that you purchase this. You won't be disappointed and it will save you time in cleaning your house. Very easy to operate.
Great vacuum!  This is a great vacuum!  Great suction and I really like that you can just pull out hose attachment and use without having to flip any settings.  I have severe back issues, and with this model being self-propelled, it moves across the floor with great ease!
I used it to clean her apartment for her and it worked great.  We got this for my 92 year old Grandma to use because her old vac was just too heavy for her to use.  This one is light weight, yet powerful.  I used it to clean her apartment for her and it worked great.
This vacuum has great suction. It is lite weight and works very well. Great value
Awesome Hoover  A very good hoover, actually gets the dirt off the floor, is quite a powerful hoover just what i was looking for in my new flat.
use in basement and cleans well like it
I'm so happy I bought this! It vacuums great and it's light weight and comfortable to use
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN BEAT IT FOR PRICE AND PERFORMANCE  I've owned big dogs for the past 30 years . After the first dog died I decided no more wall to wall carpet in the house. The upright vacuum I had was considered one of the best at the time it was purchased, but pulling out dog hair from the carpet wasn't it's strong suit. I recently moved to another house that has carpeting and I was going to replace it with laminate flooring. But in mean time I still had to vacuum the carpet. I got out my old Roval upright and what a dust storm it created so I gave the Hoover Windtunnel MAX a try after reading mostly great reviews. Man what a difference!  No dust storm, I can't see any dog hair left over! I thought I might leave the carpet in a little longer although there are other negative things about carpeting and dogs.  So far I've only owned the MAX for a month and used it four times. The HEPA bag is stuffed full with dog hair and dust. My old vac had a much bigger bag and wouldn't fill up for months and months but I'm sure that's because it  was picking up far less dog hair and dirt.   So in conclusion only time will tell how well the MAX will hold up with all the plastic (all the new vac's are that way) but for a very reasonable price this is a great vacuum cleaner.  6/17/18 update: the vacuum cleaner is still working fine but I find I can't trust the bag gauge. So every few months or less I would check to see if the bag is full.
The vacuum is perfect!!!  This was my nieces favorite gift on xmas!!!! Make sure to take Demo mode off and away it goes! It's a pretty neat cheap toy!!!
This is an excellent vacuum cleaner  This is an excellent vacuum cleaner. I have a dog and this fills within several minutes of cleaning. This makes be realize the amount of stuff that wasn't picked up by my old cleaner.  It is lightweight and easy to maneuver. Suction is amazing and noise level is moderate.  Overall would recommend to anyone who needs a new vacuum cleaner.
High Quality  This is a commercial grade vacuum that has great filtration, its sturdy, easy to maneuver, and has very unique features. Some of the features I like is the magnet that will pick up metal objects to prevent damage to the vacuum and I also like the brushes which pickup more dirt than the average vacuum. I was kind of pleasantly shocked by the grade of the vacuum, because todays vacuums are typically cheap plastic that break after a years worth of use (more like abuse if you have kids that hate to vacuum and run over everything hoping to put the family vac out of commission). However, this vacuum is far beyond the competition and in my opinion is hands down the best in construction quality.
Great vacuum , works better than any I have ever used. It was either Shark or Dyson and the price of the shark was so much better then Dyson it was easy decision. Plus Amazon gave a special deal for prime members
Best bang for the buck.  The Eureka 3670G Mighty Mite Canister Vacuum is the best vacuum I've ever used.  It is lightweight, portable, and follows you better than a puppy on a leash.  As far as vacuum power, it exceeds any small canister vac I've used.  I would recommend this vacuum for any home, to get into those tight places that big clunkers can't reach.  This is one man who doesn't mind vacuuming with this little critter!  CW
Awesome  Great for vacuuming pet hair, great suction!
Works very well.  Would recomnend
good value and  this small vacumn is stil working.  good value and pricer
You MUST buy this!  Amazingly efficient, cleans VERY well, quiet, lightweight unit.  Attachments work very well where others I've had in the past have little suction to clean efficiently.  Save yourself time, money, and trouble and buy this from Amazon!  Their prices are the BEST.  I saw the same unit in Kmart & Walmart for $25-$35 HIGHER.  Now, that's cheaper than WALMART!  I ordered with free shipping and it was here in 2 days!
nice vacuum  moves by itself and is easy to use.  I have a bad back and it is easy to use sitting down
Good Vacuum!  Good vacuum with powerful suction.  I like the fact I can order standard vacuum bags or hepa bags. Was hoping the plastic was a little stronger, but should last for many years.
It works great!  Got this for my daughter, she loves it! It works great!
This is the top terrazo tamer!!!!  My 40 year old house has terrazo flooring throughout. Mopping and Swiffers just won't get it clean. I ordered the Hoover Floor Care machine as a last resort. Assembly took less than 2 minutes. First time thought my kitchen floor makes a world of difference. Swifter is okay for spot cleaning, but can't handle the whole house. This floor cleaner is the real deal. Highly recommend this product.
