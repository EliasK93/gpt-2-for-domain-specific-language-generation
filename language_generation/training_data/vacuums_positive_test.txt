great for hardwood lofts / apartments with pets, cleans SOOOOO GOOOD, and Its easy to clean and maintain
Great appliance - delivered in a timely manner
The BEST Vacuum I have ever owned!
Love this vacuum - as much as one CAN love a vacuum.  After many weeks of vacuum cleaner research through both Consumer Reports and the reading of product reviews on various sites (Amazon.com included), I finally took the leap and purchased the Hoover S3765-040. It is terrific! To see what has come out of my carpeting when I thought we were reasonably clean people has been quite eye opening. It is powerful, efficient and thorough. Changing out the various tools is extremely easy and they operate very well. I do agree with other reviewers that it would be handy if the dust bin held a bit more.  I find that it cleans carpeting as well as it does hardwood floors. Switching between the two is very easy as is adjusting the suction strength. I find that I use different strengths between hard surfaces and carpeting. All controls are right at your finger tips.  Although I have never owned a canister vac before, I am very pleased I made the change from an upright. This vacuum gets a big grin and two thumbs up from me!
Best Vacuum I have Ever Owned!  Love, Love, Love this vacuum.  Have a central vacuum system installed in our house that i will never use again.  This vacuum picks up everything and you can actually see what you are cleaning.  Easy to use, easy to empty, easy to move around.  Highly recommend this item.
Eureka 4870MZ Boss Smart Vacuum--SUPERB BUY!!!  This is a GREAT product ... easy to use and then put away in a corner... highly recommend this vacuum!!!
Amazing. Not sure how I've survived without this  Amazing. Not sure how I've survived without this. Cleans very well and easy to use!! I was amazed at the water and stuff it picked up!!
green clean machine  Exactly what i was looking for. I have mostly hardwood, with a couple of carpeted areas and a huge indoor/outdoor rug that collects art projects debris and snow/dirt. This has a lot of suction, lightweight amd very easy to maneuver.  We couldn't figure out a couple of the attachments.....will need to open the manual.
Another Excellent Machine from Hoover  After 10 years our original wind tunnel Hoover lost its suction so we replace it with this latest model. It never ceases to amaze me how much dust and cat hair this removes from the carpeting. The instruction manual gives detailed, illustrated instructions on how to break down and clean out the interior of the machine, as well as how to remove, clean, and replace the filters. All in all, an excellent vacuum cleaner.
Thats one of the best vacuum cleaners out in the market at a competitive price!! nice job Shark!! keep the quality at optimum level !!
REALLY SUCKS!
Works great  Works amazing. Been trying to find something to make my floors shine and this does great.
Very Satisfied!
Really Sucks  I recently purchased this vacuum and it performs better then i expected. the self propelled feature works well on carpets with little effort. Consumer reports gave it one of there top ratingsas well they should. I also purchased the 20 foot extension for stairs and longer reach places without moving the vacuum whhitch makes it very easy to clean. I would recommemd this to anyone who is lookig for a good allround  vacuum.
This vacuum is the best for pets. It's not lightweight, but works as advertised.
Bought another one - very good  has a nice small head so it gets around tight places in the RV.  Lightweight; easy to clean; I've bought two so far.
Best little vacuum ever!!
Great suction power and portability  It's a great little vacuum cleaner for getting closer to the wall edges, corners and steps! I use it to supplement my full-size vacuum cleaner that can't easily get to the small areas. It actually has more power than my full-size. Unlike other comments I read about the cleaner, I found that the power cord and hose are both plenty long enough. I'm very glad I bought it!
Excellent choice loved it
Get this vacuum!  This vacuum is great! I was really surprised by its power!  I needed a lightweight vacuum that would be easy to access underneath bed, bureaus, etc, and this is perfect!  Great on hardwood and carpet!
LOve our hand vac  LOve our hand vac! Easy to use and very handy around the house, battery lasts long and good for an entire cleaning of the house! Has great functions and easy light weight to move around...our 10 year old uses it with no problems! Its great
It's very lightweight and it works really well I have a dog and it gets all the dog hair up. Love the fact that I don't have to buy any vacuum bags I could just pop it open empty it done.
excellent , could not be more satisfied it was just as I expected ,, Smooth glide and does an excellent job
cleans my tile floors much better than mop and is easier on the hands.
Awesome Vacuum  This unit replaced a 23 year old Kenmore whose hose was held together with duct tape and the plastic had yellowed.  That vacuum was still going strong but when we moved, I decided it was time for a new one.  We love this new vacuum. The suction is so powerful, there's nothing this thing could not clean.  The attachments are great and easy to use.  The price was a great value.  For a canister vacuum, it is very lightweight and best of all, the power head is very maneuverable, allowing you to easily get to those hard to reach places.  Overall, an excellent vacuum.
Great vaccum... does everything but mow the lawn
better than any other vaccuum i've ever used  at first i was very wary of this vacuum, because of the price. i mean, what could possibly be so special about this vacuum that it costs so much money?? i have 3 long haired cats and a baby, so i vacuum every other day and this thing picks up way more stuff than i ever could imagine is even there. i've had it for over a year, have not had ANY issues with it. other vacuums i have used always got clogs in the hoses because of all the cathair, or would eventually just lose suction all together. this vacuum may be very expensive, but it is worth the investment if you have animals, or even if you have bad allergies. it is not heavier than a regular vacuum, and because of the expandable hose, it is very easy to vacuum stairs and to get those cobwebs in the high corners of the ceiling. the canister that collects the dirt is easy to empty by just releasing a clip. definitely better than having to shake it upside down over a trash can (creating a big dustcloud), which was the case with my dirt devil. i would definitely recommend this vacuum to anyone who has animals.
Great Value  I bought this vacuum cleaner mainly for my stairs and hardwood floors in my home.  It's really lightweight and does a fantastic job.  I have two cats and you can imagine the cat hair collecting everywhere.  With the broom half of it would just fly around the room.  The vacuum is straight suction only which is perfect for hardwood.  It has more than enough suction.  As a matter of fact, the woman who cleans my house had me order one for her house.  She especially loved how she could sweep under the cupboard ledges in the kitchen and bathroom, something her Shark couldn't do.  The hose is also quite long.  I am able to go halfway up the stairs without moving the vacuum. The only carpet this vacuum sees is what is on my staircase, so I will not comment on it's ability to vacuum carpets.  But it picks up cat hair like no tomorrow. I also use pine pellets for my cat litter.  The big draw back is they break down into sawdust.  This vacuum picks them up easily.  The only real negative I've seen with this is the bag looks small.  But, I've had it two months and haven't had to change the bag yet.  Then again, I live alone and do not track much into the house.
Dyson DC39 Animal Canister Vacuum Cleaner, what great litttle vacuum  When I first opened my box and looked at my new vacuum I thought this can't be any good. It was so small. How wrong I was. This little vacuum is so powerful, lightweight and easy to maneuver. I have a cat and a dog so the power is really lifting the dirt and animal hair better than any vacuum I have had so far. The bonus is not having to buy bags. I would highly recommend this vacuum.
What an amazing machine  What an amazing macine  I have tile floors in kitchen, bathroom, and entry way.  To tell you the truth I really wondered  if this was going to give you clean floors.  To my surprise it cleaned them to exceed my expections.  Not a mop can do good  this good of a job. So out the door went my bucket and mop.  After I was finished the floors had a brightness to them.  If anyone is wondering if it cleans ground in dirt, it will take it up.  This is a excellent product and would recommend that you purchase this. You won't be disappointed and it will save you time in cleaning your house. Very easy to operate.
Great vacuum!  This is a great vacuum!  Great suction and I really like that you can just pull out hose attachment and use without having to flip any settings.  I have severe back issues, and with this model being self-propelled, it moves across the floor with great ease!
I used it to clean her apartment for her and it worked great.  We got this for my 92 year old Grandma to use because her old vac was just too heavy for her to use.  This one is light weight, yet powerful.  I used it to clean her apartment for her and it worked great.
This vacuum has great suction. It is lite weight and works very well. Great value
Awesome Hoover  A very good hoover, actually gets the dirt off the floor, is quite a powerful hoover just what i was looking for in my new flat.
use in basement and cleans well like it
I'm so happy I bought this! It vacuums great and it's light weight and comfortable to use
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN BEAT IT FOR PRICE AND PERFORMANCE  I've owned big dogs for the past 30 years . After the first dog died I decided no more wall to wall carpet in the house. The upright vacuum I had was considered one of the best at the time it was purchased, but pulling out dog hair from the carpet wasn't it's strong suit. I recently moved to another house that has carpeting and I was going to replace it with laminate flooring. But in mean time I still had to vacuum the carpet. I got out my old Roval upright and what a dust storm it created so I gave the Hoover Windtunnel MAX a try after reading mostly great reviews. Man what a difference!  No dust storm, I can't see any dog hair left over! I thought I might leave the carpet in a little longer although there are other negative things about carpeting and dogs.  So far I've only owned the MAX for a month and used it four times. The HEPA bag is stuffed full with dog hair and dust. My old vac had a much bigger bag and wouldn't fill up for months and months but I'm sure that's because it  was picking up far less dog hair and dirt.   So in conclusion only time will tell how well the MAX will hold up with all the plastic (all the new vac's are that way) but for a very reasonable price this is a great vacuum cleaner.  6/17/18 update: the vacuum cleaner is still working fine but I find I can't trust the bag gauge. So every few months or less I would check to see if the bag is full.
The vacuum is perfect!!!  This was my nieces favorite gift on xmas!!!! Make sure to take Demo mode off and away it goes! It's a pretty neat cheap toy!!!
This is an excellent vacuum cleaner  This is an excellent vacuum cleaner. I have a dog and this fills within several minutes of cleaning. This makes be realize the amount of stuff that wasn't picked up by my old cleaner.  It is lightweight and easy to maneuver. Suction is amazing and noise level is moderate.  Overall would recommend to anyone who needs a new vacuum cleaner.
High Quality  This is a commercial grade vacuum that has great filtration, its sturdy, easy to maneuver, and has very unique features. Some of the features I like is the magnet that will pick up metal objects to prevent damage to the vacuum and I also like the brushes which pickup more dirt than the average vacuum. I was kind of pleasantly shocked by the grade of the vacuum, because todays vacuums are typically cheap plastic that break after a years worth of use (more like abuse if you have kids that hate to vacuum and run over everything hoping to put the family vac out of commission). However, this vacuum is far beyond the competition and in my opinion is hands down the best in construction quality.
Great vacuum , works better than any I have ever used. It was either Shark or Dyson and the price of the shark was so much better then Dyson it was easy decision. Plus Amazon gave a special deal for prime members
Best bang for the buck.  The Eureka 3670G Mighty Mite Canister Vacuum is the best vacuum I've ever used.  It is lightweight, portable, and follows you better than a puppy on a leash.  As far as vacuum power, it exceeds any small canister vac I've used.  I would recommend this vacuum for any home, to get into those tight places that big clunkers can't reach.  This is one man who doesn't mind vacuuming with this little critter!  CW
Awesome  Great for vacuuming pet hair, great suction!
Works very well.  Would recomnend
good value and  this small vacumn is stil working.  good value and pricer
You MUST buy this!  Amazingly efficient, cleans VERY well, quiet, lightweight unit.  Attachments work very well where others I've had in the past have little suction to clean efficiently.  Save yourself time, money, and trouble and buy this from Amazon!  Their prices are the BEST.  I saw the same unit in Kmart & Walmart for $25-$35 HIGHER.  Now, that's cheaper than WALMART!  I ordered with free shipping and it was here in 2 days!
nice vacuum  moves by itself and is easy to use.  I have a bad back and it is easy to use sitting down
Good Vacuum!  Good vacuum with powerful suction.  I like the fact I can order standard vacuum bags or hepa bags. Was hoping the plastic was a little stronger, but should last for many years.
It works great!  Got this for my daughter, she loves it! It works great!
This is the top terrazo tamer!!!!  My 40 year old house has terrazo flooring throughout. Mopping and Swiffers just won't get it clean. I ordered the Hoover Floor Care machine as a last resort. Assembly took less than 2 minutes. First time thought my kitchen floor makes a world of difference. Swifter is okay for spot cleaning, but can't handle the whole house. This floor cleaner is the real deal. Highly recommend this product.
Second time puchase. No complaints. Works well on carpet in rented apartment.
Obsessed with this. Total lifesaver for a clean freak.
After 7 months I'm still amazed!  I wanted to wait at least 6 months to write my review of the Dyson DC07 Animal so the "newness" wouldn't factor into my review.  All I can say is I am actually happier with the vacuum now than I was 7 months ago.  Our old vacuum was on it's last leg and my wife had her mind made up that she had to have a Dyson.  Kohl's had the DC07 Animal on sale, plus opening a Kohl's charge account saved us even more money.  That night we vacuumed the house and we were amazed and disgusted with how much dirt, dust, and dog hair the Dyson swept up.  After a week of use our carpet actually looked brighter and cleaner.  I think I like using the vacuum more than our old bag vacuum because you can see what you sweep up.  I guess it's like a sense of accomplishment to see it.  The vacuum works as well today as it did the day we brought it home, and that is after vacuuming 1600 sq ft 2-3 times per week with a dog and two toddlers in the house.  Needless to say the vacuum gets a workout.  If I could recommend one thing to anyone considering and eventually purchasing this vacuum - READ THE DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY!  This is especially important during assembly.  I'm not a "read the directions' kind of guy, so I was less than impressed with the wand - it was cumbersome and hard to use in tight areas.  My wife kindly showed me that the wand extended and made life much easier - I'm glad she read the directions.
I love this!!  Best hundred bucks, more or less, we have ever spent!!  I didn't realize what garbage our old vacuum was until I got this one.  It makes our carpet look almost new after each vacuuming.  We have two dogs and a cat, this baby picks up hair like none other.  I too think the cord needs to be a little longer, but for the price, buy an extension cord and get this vacuum cleaner.  We have had this for almost a year and it is going strong.  Even if it only lasts a couple of years, I will still buy another one just like it!!
Works great on wood imitation floor and carpet. Easy to clean as well.
I'm obsessed with this vacuum!  This was a great buy!! It has awesome suction power and the bag traps all the dirt. I had a bag-less vacuum and after using this vacuum, I prefer a bagged vacuum any day of the week.  Comes with several attachments that make cleaning various items easy! I must use this bad boy every day of the week. Makes vacuuming a breeze! Also, this vacuum is not heavy at all. I don't kill myself lugging it up the stairs.
My wife loves it! Light weight, works well!
blown away  I have a one-year-old golden retreiver that has had his way with the carpet, not to mention the floor, couch and chairs. When my new Hoover Steamer V2 arrived it only took a short time to put together. I started on the carpet, then to the furniture. The stains I thought would never go away were easily cleaned away. All the proof I needed that this thing was a cleaning machine was to look at the recovery tank each time I emptied it. I was blown away by how much dirt was in my carpet and furniture. Totally unbeleivable! I highly recommend this powerful cleaner. It does more than the rented cleaners for sure.
Absolutely worth every dollar  Debated for a month whether to spend the dollars to replace our Dyson 33-I am very glad I did.  Made the final decision when Dyson offered the free handheld which has been extremely helpful for those clean up messes.  The charge holds for a month or longer depending on the amount of use.  Back to the DC65, having three medium length hair dogs the sucking power is very efficient and powerful unlike the 33 it would three times as long to remove hair.  I must admit that the first time I used the DC65 I accidentally got a little too close to one of my husband's dirty socks the vacuum sucked it right into the collection container whereas with the 33 the sock got tangled around the spinner.  Lots of accessory tools that are handy for those difficult projects-like cleaning the dust off ceiling fans.  The vacuum will go from carpet to tile and back to carpet without any problems unlike the 33.  Extremely happy with the investment.
Love this Vacuum Cleaner  Great value for the money.  The longer cord is nice, and the rewind works great every time.  Dirt canister is very easy to empty out.  This is a great product.
great for the price!  great for the price I paid, strong suction to keep my once-a-week entire-house vacuuming lasting, and it's small so it fits even in a small closet. Very easy to clean, i'm pretty satisfied with this purchase. Totally worth it!
Quiet, light & cleans well  This is a whole new vacuuming experience. Well thought out, well engineered, easy to use & cleans well, cleans the air while you vacuum & is very quiet. Being able to turn the carpet brush on & off at the handle when you switch from carpet to hardwood is very handy.
It's amazing! Really gets all the pet hairs as we have two cats and a dog. Couldn't keep the house clean with some other brands. One down side is if you do try and use it on wooden floors or tiles you can sometimes feel bits and pieces hit your feet the the brush shoots towards you but isn't sucked up. So we sweet and swiffer the kitchen. Besides that is does the damage to pet hair on couches and carpet and in the car!
Dyson is the Animal  There is no doubt in my mind that the Dyson creates superior vacuums.  I'm not certain how it compares with the Miele, but I am certainly very happy with this purchase. The canister picks up all debris and dust and pet hair (and we have tons of it!) with a high power suction that has surpassed all my expectations.  Not to mention the Amazon refurbished model saved me over $200 on a brand new model and yet came in the mail pristine, clean and looking barely used.  I'm ecstatic with my purchase and can't speak highly enough about it!
Very cute.  Whimsical vacuum cover. Too bad this French maid doesn't do the vacuuming for me!
Great little vac!!  Wasn't planning on spending this much $ on a vacuum cleaner, but after reading all of the positive reviews, I was sold.  This model is slim and perfect for anyone who has tight spaces.  I live in a city studio, and this vacuum cleaner is perfect.  It fits in tight spaces and the swivel head is ingenious!  I was ready to buy a $45 DirtDevil at Target, but remembered my bad experience in the past with cheap vacuum cleaners.  After doing a ton of research and faced with an opportunity to purchase this unit at a good deal, I took the plunge.  You definitely get what you pay for.
Works Great  I have tried numerous cleaners and the Hoover works great. I would highly recommend to anyone with wood floors. Easy to use.
cleaning is fun
In love!! One of the best gifts ever from my hubby!!
Excellent for small tasks where you prefer not to use a broom (and car cleaning).  Excellent for small tasks where you prefer not to use a broom.  I live on the beach, so sand on my wood floors and couch is an omnipresent problem.  Thankfully, the floppy makes short work of sand and other small debris.  Battery life is short, but you know that going into this purchase.  Truthfully, I've only run the battery dead mid task twice in 3 years.  Car cleaning is also a breeze, and it's the main reason I purchased this vacuum.  Prior to the fluffy, I used a DC-35, and that did a good job, but lacked the suction power of the V6.  Final note, the filter ABSOLUTELY does fall out of the vacuum if you tip it past 90 degrees.  It only happens when the vacuum is off, but it's still an issue for someone like me that only hits the trigger when I see a spot to clean (particularly in a car).  The fix is both cheap and unsightly, a piece of tape.  Hopefully Dyson addresses this issue in the V8 iteration of their handheld cordless vacuums.
perfect replacement vac
A Must-Have for Hard Floor Surfaces!  We have ceramic tile in every room of our house, which requires constant vacuuming. This machine is great! It's lightweight enough to carry as you vacuum, or rolls easily if you want to put it down. It has a powerful motor, and it uses a bag, which I actually prefer. My one piece of advice is to invest in the flat, hard floor nozzle if using primarily on hard surfaces. The suctioning works better, and I don't have to stop every couple of minutes to clean off the dust kitties and debris that gets caught in the brush bristles of the attachment I was using before. I had to order the nozzle from the manufacturer's website, but the price wasn't out of line. I also recommend the pet paw attachment if you have dogs or cats-it's better than any other attachment at getting pet hair off furniture.
This is a great vacuum cleaner.
World's best vacuum  Shipped quickly, well package, scary good. Replaces older DC17 model. The 41 is lighter and turns easier. Bride was pleased.
Good for corners or areas hard to get to, and overhead
Awesome
Good So far  Worked well right out of the box with minimal assembly.  4 screws. Looked nearly brand new except for a small 3" scratch on the handle.  Used it for about half an hour. Ill see how reliablity is in 3 months
These guys were so easy to work with and very responsive  These guys were so easy to work with and very responsive.  I will most certainly order from this co. again.  Oh yeah, and the vacuum works great!
works great on tile floor
Works great
Love it!!
I have 2 very long haired Maine Coon cats.  Better than any other vacuum cleaner I have ever owned and my previous ones were not cheap ones.  Highly recommend.
It does what it says and the results are great.  However, it is a somewhat slow process.
Love it  Great vacuum! I had one similar and it lasted a good amount of years. It cleans really well and it light and easy to empty. I like how you can see all the dirt it picks up too.
Excellent vacuum for floors and carpet. I am very satisfied
Good value.  I love the long extension wand as I don't have to bend my back to vacuum the floors. The power head for picking up cat hairs from furniture is very effective. Good suction and the price is right
Very nice, both work well  I know many of the reviews state the main vacuum is hard to push. But that is all relative. Remember this unit is not self powered like some high end vacuums. So without a motor helping push and pull it is up to you. And would your rather have a vacuum that is easy to push but doesn't vacuum up much dirt, or a vacuum that has great suction power like this one and feel that suction as you use it? I help my wife vacuum and I will say it seems easy to pull toward you and pushing is where there is more resistance. Buy that probably has to do with which way the beater brush is spinning. Anyway, the main vacuum works great, it is not really that loud. We have had louder. The little one works well for the stairs and is very light weight. Great price for the pair.
This Vacuum Works Great!  This vacuum works great! It picks up everything I've encountered and the attachments allow it to get in those hard-to-reach areas.
This is AMAZING!!  This is AMAZING!!!!  Lightweight, easy to use, and the attachments are right there easy to use without stopping.  I can't believe what came out of my carpet!  The ease of dumping the dirt and putting back in is astonishing!  LOVE LOVE LOVE!
Great  little vaccum  It  meets all my requirements and does a good job of cleaning up every bit of dust. I wish I bought it sooner.
Grams  Without a doubt, this cleaner is way ahead of it's time. The only draw back is that it doesn't do a thorough job on patterened carpets.
Does an excellent job on cleaning my slate floors that the steam shark can't touch.. So glad I got this, my floors are truly clean now !
Great suction  This vacuum has so much suction that I could barely push it forward on our very thick carpet. The problem was resolved by a call to Dyson and removal of a seal around the bottom of the unit. Cleaning was not affected, but ease of use was greatly improved.
A real improvement  I had the last version of this floor cleaner, and the big problem with it was the complicated tank system. The dirty water clogged everything up, and it was impossible to clean it properly (leading to bad smells and being completely gross to look at!)  In the new version, however, they have a new two tank system (one on either side of the body of the machine) and the dirty water tank is easy to access and clean, as is the removable spinning brush system! That is fantastic!  There's an extra brush head included (apparently for "sensitive" wooden floors). I have a mix of stone and wood floors and the one attached when delivered works great on both - I will just use that one and save the other for when this one wears.  They've made it super easy to detach, which means not just the brushes but the vacuuming part can be cleaned - which avoids previous clogging problems with the old version. The brush has been reduced from 5 to 4 slightly larger ones, but I haven't noticed any problems when cleaning - they seem as efficient.  This time the on-off button is a soft push button on the left hand side, and there is a green foot-thingy to push down to tilt the handle (and start cleaning). When wanting to put the handle back to vertical, you have to push it forward slightly (more than you'd instinctually want to) in order for it to click and keep the vertical position.  The only problem I've found is with those great new tanks - they are tall - which means filling the clean water tank at the kitchen sink, but who wants to empty the dirty water down the kitchen sink? No, no, no! So... the cleaning and filling need two different locations. My bathroom sink has a short faucet, so I end up having to put water in another container in order to swish out the dirty water tank... hmmm...  If people have laundry sinks (who has one of these in NYC? I'd like to be their friend!), that would probably take care of this problem.  However, in comparison to the other plusses, this isn't enough to even make me take away a star...  maybe a half star if I had that option.  Anyhow, if you have wood, lino, or stone floors - this is a terrific cleaner. It gets into the grout between the granite, sucks the water right off my wooden floors (so I have no worries about using it there), and is very easy to push around and use. Also, there is definitely more suction than on the previous model, so I really can just vacuum with it first and then clean - I love it!
SO IMPRESSIVE EVEN MY 16 YR. OLD  WANTED A TRY...  Slick modern look, but who even cares about that when so much power is packed into such a lightweight unit.  I no longer wanted the clumsy uprights but was hesitant about the weight that would probably be needed for an effective canister.  No problem with this featherweight, and the quick release, easy disposal dirt cup just keeps everything at a maximum effectiveness.  You can control the suction as you go which makes it easier to keep fringe on area rugs from getting caught.  I hope it is as durable as it is effective; it will be hard to go back to any other type of vacuum.
Fabulous!  Awesome vaccum...I was amazed at how much it picked up. A must have if you have dogs/cats. Great price for great vacuum cleaner.
Miele Quality and Suction in a Stick Vac  A great addition to my Miele family, this little red stick packs super suction.  Interchangeable with my current Miele attachments, I love being able to get this out for quick runs through the kitchen and around the door when the big Miele upright or canister is not needed.  Coupled with my SEB 236 power head from my Miele Capricorn, it is as good on carpets as my other 2 Mieles.  Definitely worth the $200.  Yes, it is heavy, but well balanced.  Would I use this with attachments or for anything but floor cleaning? NO.  That's what other models are made for.  But for quick sweeping, as a daily-driver, this one fits the bill.
Love this vacuum cleaner  Love this vacuum cleaner! It is the best I have had so far and it does a great job sucking up pet fur (I have two dogs that shed like there is no tomorrow) and the crumbs my 1 year old leave behind in the carpet. As long as you clean the container after every room vacuumed it sucks like it was brand new!
Lightweight grime slurper - really like it  Just got this and it really does slurp up all the grime and dust. So far, I'm impressed.  Pros - great suction on both floor and tools setting, very light, dust container is easy to clean, washable filter Cons - cord is not retractable, the hose often falls out of the little clip on the top front of the handle
Replaced my 27 year old Rainbow vacuum  I had a very reliable Rainbow - but they are super expensive now.  And ours was getting a little old in the tooth - plastic parts failing after 27 years. So I did a bunch of research and decided to go with Rainbow. Then I ended up buying 3 different models - one for us and one each for daughters.  These are well made. A decent compromise between canister and normal upright.  The major complaint from my wife on this one is the expandable "hose" is a bit stiff.  Other than that - it is great. And "Green" tool - as there are no bags to go to landfills. It is difficult to determine the "optimal" size from mail-order.  You might want to look at these in person. But we ended up Buying this one for ourselves.
Best vacuum ever!  Tried one of the vacuums you buy on TV, while suction was good the dust always managed to leak out and the tools were not as useful.  I came back to Electrolux UltraActive because it does what it says it will and does it well!
Packaged well and easy to put together in 3 steps  First Dyson product I ever bought. Packaged well and easy to put together in 3 steps. The canister has a bottom that opens at a push of a button and easier to empty than one's I have owned in the past. Attachment hose is built in and easy to pull it up and use as well. Do not regret the purchase and my all tile floors are happy. I also noticed how much it collected and was truly shocked. Thanks Dyson....
My wife loves it!  My wife is a obsessed clean freak and this made all her cleaning dreams come true. In fact she made me pick up all the movable stuff off the floor and then proceeded to clean as soon as I put it together! It was as tho she hadn't cleaned in a year with how many times she filled the canister even though she vacuums several times a week before with the old vacuum.
Lightweight Powerhouse - Best Buy  I am a vacuum cleaner fanatic.  I want it all - lightweight, power, clean exhaust!  I have owned almost every brand out there, and I am turning in my heavy Dyson for this little Hoover.  I am very impressed with this vacuum.  For the price, it runs circles around the expensive models. Don't let cost be your only factor; sometimes they are just overpriced!
Good value.  Works well.  Suction is good and I like the different height settings.  The long cord is a plus.  So far, so good.
but does a good cleaning on tile floors and grout lines  takes a little getting used to, but does a good cleaning on tile floors and grout lines.  The 'vac only' mode is great for picking up excess water
Picky Shopper  My wife absolutely loves it. We are in our 70's and it's really easy to operate. It picks up dirt with no problem. We are very happy with it. We would strongly recommend it to a friend.
Fantastic Vac  works super well. Fine on carpet and hardwood.
Product came as described love it would definitely buy again and recommend to friends and family
Works perfectly. Very powerful.
works great, love it.
very happy...  The Vac arrived within two days! Also very impressed with its performance, easy to "dump" the dirt container (a little common sense goes a long way to eliminate dust when dumping). We had a central Vac system (although old) and we are glad we got this upright, just wish we had gotten it sooner. The LONG power cord is a big plus. If you are thinking of getting one, stop thinking and start buying, you won't be sorry.
A great vacuum for $200  Just got it and we tried a test.  We took our old Miele upright vacuum and vacuumed the carpets thoroughly.  Then we vacuumed again with the Shark.  The amount of dirt that it extracted was disgusting.  It's so much better and light weight, too.  The ability to remove the canister and vacuum under the sofa without moving it is a big plus.  Lots of good attachments.  Seems very well engineered.  Spend 15 minutes and read the instructions.
Great Vacuum with very useful tools  I recently purchased this vacuum.  In my search for a handheld vacuum to clean carpeted stairs and furniture, I read an article that listed this Shark vacuum in the top 5 for best vacuums for stairs/furniture.  As I said, I only wanted a handheld but as I was shopping for one, I realized I would need to spend around $50 dollars.  I then rationalized that we have had our current vacuum for over 4 years, so maybe it's time for a new one.  With this rationalization, I pulled the trigger and bought this one.  Like others have done, I purchased from Bed/Bath/Beyond using a 20% off coupon.  I ordered online and while waiting for it's arrival, I found the same vacuum on sale at the base exchange for $212.  This vacuum is replacing a Dyson DC33 and a Bissel Pet Hair Eliminator (which was used for stair and furniture and in my opinion, never very effective).  The Dyson does not do stairs.  We do have two full sized dogs:  a black lab and a German Shepard.  I put the Shark together last night and took my time vacuuming the entire house and trying all of the different attachments.  Sorry, but in this review you won't find a demonstration of vacuuming with the Dyson and then vacuuming again with the Shark to see what the Dyson missed.  I will make comparisons of the vacuums though.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the Shark but full disclosure here:  I was never all that happy with the Dyson to begin with.  As you can see from the pictures, the main roller/brush housings on the two vacuums are much different in size with the Shark being much smaller.  This is a HUGE advantage.  The Dyson could not fit under anything and always required the use of the hose to vacuum around furniture after vacuuming the floors.  The shark fits under most of my furniture and with the exception of some corners, I did not need to use the wand which made the job of cleaning much faster.  The Shark also has 'headlights', which does not add to the functionality but it is something I really like.  Using the wand on the Shark is a much easier task than the Dyson.  All that is needed with the Shark is to push one of two buttons (depending on if you want the wand or just the handle), and start vacuuming.  The Dyson requires disconnecting the handle with the push of the button and then pulling the wand out of the handle where it normally sits.  As I mentioned earlier, I originally wanted a vacuum for stairs and furniture.  This is where the lift-away feature is very handy.  Cleaning stairs and furniture does require two tools; the crevice tool and the smaller brush/roller attachment but switching between the two is very easy and the Shark was very effective.  Others have commented on the cheap plastic feeling of the Shark but it has the same build quality of the Dyson.  My only complaint was the size of the waste container...it is small.  I vacuum once per week and normally will fill two canisters full with the Dyson.  The Shark's canister is half the size of the Dyson (maybe even smaller than that) and required 5-6 empties (I lost count) for the entire job.  This is a very easy to use vacuum and the tools it comes with are very useful.
Best Vacuum Ever Owned  Light, quiet and does the job!!  Easy to use and storage is great.  I've owned many vacuums but this is the greatest.
Highly rated, highly reccommended  This steam vac is nice and does a fine job. We were not sure about value but it is nice not to have to run to the store for one.
wife love's it, runs for about 30 min's on one battery charging !
I can't believe I'm reviewing a vacuum, but it's that good!!!  I have a 100 pound dog that is shedding in the hot summer heat. I'm a single guy and rarely vacuum, so I put this thing through it's paces. HOLY CRAP IS THIS THING GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I have to admit I bought the dyson animal from another site, refurbished for half the price but now that I own one, I'd be willing to pay full price. If you have a large hairy dog that sheds a lot and you've got a lot of carpet, then this is the only vacuum for you!
this is my 6 dyson only one i will ever use
What a great floor cleaner. I love Hoover products.
This bissell works better than either of the two dysons we have had  This bissell works better than either of the two dysons we have had.  It does a great job with all of the pet hair.  We have dogs and cats, many different colors and coat types.  This vacuum is able to handle all of the types of fur our fur babies shed.  It also does quite well with all of the dirt my two young sons bring in from outside.
Love it!!  This was a replacement for my Kenmore & first bagless vacuum & I love it. Don't go by what Amazon says for the replacement belts or filters as they're not the right ones, but it's a great, lightweight vacuum that picks up great. It's the perfect one for my apartment & I'd recommend it to anyone who may be a skeptic.
Great Value  Excellent in all respects and a terrific buy for the money.
Has a bag just as much suck as bag less but no auto retract cord
nice improvements in function  Replaced 40 yr old similar model; nice improvements in function; still my favorite vacuum
Excellent value  Works great in our condo and really picks up pet hair well.  Also the filter has made all of our allergies improve greatly.  For the price, I don't know how it could be better.
You won't be disappointed!  I loved it. Tile floors through my home with minimal throw rugs and it works great! We also have two dogs so theres lots of hair and the dyson picks up everything. I can vaccum under my sectional and under my bathroom vanities. Love  If I had to add anything Id want a light on the head of the sweeper and the cord a tad longer.
It sucks so well! happy sucking. Dyson Rocks!  sucks hard. came fast. all attachments and extensions, even extra filter. glad I got it on sale here at the 179 price. woohoo. would recommend this at this price in a heartbeat. came in generic cardboard box.
how to make less work  Great vacuum, I had an LG upright which was a pain. The hoover makes my job a walk in the park.
Our new Blue is Perfect Too ..  This is the second Henry/Nacecare/numatic vacuum we bought for our cleaning business and it's outstanding- not sure how we went so long with other models like Mieles sucking us dry for bags and ridiculously priced parts.. Not using as a wet vac, but it's nice to have if we need it.  Anyone trying to decide if it's worth it ..it is.  Unbelievable suction,  Giant bags and plenty of space for the bags to fill up into. This thing is a beast but actually quiet.  Big outtake for the air to be expelled.  The cord is long enough to never have to plug and unplug unless you go to another house level(sometimes not even then) Thick also ..can't imagine hurting it.  It's held on like it was made to be abused.  Tough plastic foam/and not heavy, moves around quite easy.  This thing is great for home or business!! A=+  Cons --  Only problem is to much suction.
GREAT Vacuum, don't be afraid of the "used"  We bought this as a replacement for another Dirt Devil we have had for years that is starting to have some minor issues. The old Dirt Devil as been relegated to being the "downstairs vacuum" as it still works fine but is just starting to show it's age with minor little issues.  I'm a bit of a cheapskate, spendthrift, what have you, so I took a chance on one of the "used".  From the description it sounded like brand new, just with non-attractive packaging due to damage in shipping. I ordered one of the "used" and sure enough, brand new, never used, just the box was a little battered. Saved an additional $19 also.  Great vacuum, as are all Dirt Devils we have owned. Highly recommend!
Small , light and  good powerful vacuum. Good for small place...  I live in one bedroom apartment by myself, so I wanted to buy small and light vacuum. I don't expect this use more than 3year. Most people who leaved review, complained about durable. I used this only 3month, so I can't say this is durable or not. one thing I can say, this vacuum is not for big place. When you see shot power line, you will agree  this is not for big place. if you have bigger place than one bedroom, why don't you buy bigger and better vacuum. People used this for big place and said this vaccum has overheat problem.. Any  small vacuum will have Same problem if it will be used for big place .. I bought this and eureka quick up coded stick vacuum($26powerful vacuum in Walmart). I use this one or two time a week, and use stick vaccum everyday because of small room. If you go to lowes they will charge this $49.99... I really satisfied this vacuum.
Have had it for a few years now and have no complaints!
Gets the job done well  I purchased a less expensive Eureka vacuum to help manage the pet hair problems I've been having, with three dogs living in my house.  It broke after one use, so I decided to bite the bullet and pay a little extra for a Dyson.  I couldn't afford to get the larger, more expensive Dyson, but thought the DC24 would be enough to get the job done.  I was right.  PROS The ball:  I LOVE the Dyson ball feature.  I have always had the standard rectangular vacuums, that are relatively difficult to maneuver. The ball is easy to maneuver, and lets me get into tighter spaces.  It moves really well, and makes vacuuming kind of fun (is that sad?). It works well:  It manages to pick up all the pet hair and dirt left by my dogs.  I have both hardwood floors and medium-pile carpet, and the vacuum worked well in both areas. Lightweight:  The description says it weighs 17 pounds, which is light enough for me to carry up and down my three-story townhome.  It's also light enough for me to use on my stairs without killing my arms. It's easy to clean:  The design of the machine makes it really easy to take the cannister off and empty it. You just click the cannister out, hold it over your trash bag or can, pull a little trigger and shake the dirt and hair out.  Really easy! Attachments:  While some people on here have complained about the attachments, and how difficult they are to attach, I disagree.  I think they are well-made and easy to use.  Everything snaps in and out of place easily for me, and I like that the extension for reaching corners, ceilings, etc. is part of the main handle of the vacuum.  There's not a lot of extra junk hanging off the machine, and when everything is put into place, it is very compact.  The hose works well, and helped me clean hard-to-reach areas like next to the fridge, and in the corners of my ceiling. Appearance:  It might not even matter to most people, but I just think it looks cool.  It's not clunky and awkward, and overflowing with hoses and plastic attachments.  It's sleek and compact.  CONS Cord:  As others have said, it's got a fairly short cord.  It's not a big issue for me, because I have tons of outlets, and don't have a huge house that would cause problems reaching certain areas.  But I can see how it could be problematic in this case, and it is slightly annoying to have to plug it in several times.  But honestly, it hasn't been a huge issue. Cannister Volume:  The cannister doesn't hold as much junk as I would hope.  Like I said, I have three dogs, who all shed a decent amount, and I have to empty the cannister a couple times every time I use the vacuum.  If I could afford the bigger version of this vacuum, I would have gotten it, but I make due with this smaller version.  Overall, I recommend this vacuum.  It's stylish, lightweight and works well.  I like using it, so I actually vacuum more often now. The short cord and small cannister volume might make you think twice about this particular model if you need something bigger and farther-reaching, but I wouldn't hesitate to get a Dyson.  I love the thing.
Awesome but bulky to do stairs.  A little bulky to do stair with.
Great bagless vacuum!  I've tried bagless vacuums before with disappointment.  I decided to try this because of the reviews I had heard.  Wow, now I love vacuuming and will pull out my vacuum for any reason.  You can see how much dirt dust, etc is pulled out of your rugs!
I do love it, but had I known just how heavy it is, I would have looked for something lighter.  It does a top notch job of vacuuming, I have a dog and a LOT of dog hair.  It's a good deal for the price.
So far so good!
Love it.  A vacuum needs a bag or it doesn't work well.  This one provides great suction; headlight; easy to use. Isn't very easy to carry up or down stairs, but I can forgive that since it has good suction.  I also do not like how the attachments all fit on the extension tubes with the crevice tool.  You have to undo all to use.
Bissell Zing Vacuum  This vacuum is wonderful.  Love everything about it.
work great
Love it  Ok, well I haven't had every brand but I think this vacuum works GREAT! I get a sick satisfaction dumping the dirt/fur after I use it. Sadly, I dump a lot (Two dogs and a cat in the house).  Its light weight and is self propelled. I also enjoy the retractable cord, really easy to put away. Works great and love the price!
Excellent Vacuum!  This is the perfect vacuum for me.  My concern is the amount of dust that is ejected back into the room from many vacuums, even ones that claim to have a HEPA filter.  This one catches all the dust and particulates (mold too!) in the bag and filter so my home stays clean. It vacuums bare floors very well.  It takes a little more effort to push since it's not self-propelled and if you want a powered brush that attachment is additional, but I find it works well without it.  If you want your home clean and dust free, this machine gives good results.
This is the best vacuum ever  This is the best vacuum ever, and I've had them all, Shark, Dyson, Hoover even the Rainbow. This vacuum is easy to handle, not too heavy, and stands sturdy.  It doesn't tip.  The Shark was the worst.
This vacuum is amazing!  It has great suction and is lightweight and easy to use...even our kids like vacuuming the floors now!
It is one of the best buys I have made  I have owned this vacuum for two years. It is one of the best buys I have made. I go brushless on bare floors -easy to use and a long cord. I use it on outdoor carpet (outdoors) and it does a great job. This a very low priced vacuum doing a high priced job. Bag is very easy to replace. No more cleaning the disgusting filter on the bagless for me. It rivals my high priced Kirby on cleaning. Gets harder to push on higher carpet so I raise it up.
A Great Vacuum  I bought this upright vacuum 4 years ago because I was looking for one with lots of features.  It has a 12 amp motor and works well on both carpets and hardwood floors. I chose this vacuum because it had the hepa filtration system. I also liked that it has the hose and attachments which some uprights do not have. Another plus is the long cord so you don't have to constantly be plugging and unplugging the vacuum. The vacuum only broke down once in the 4 years and it was during the warranty period and Eureka honored the warranty and authorized and paid for the repair. I would definitely recommend this vacuum and kudos to Eureka for standing behind there product.
Best vaccum there is.  This vaccum is a beast. After cleaning the hardwood floors, they become noticeably more glossy. The vaccum does take some getting used to and it certainly does get hot if you use it for an extended amount of time, but the amount of garbage that this thing picks up is nothing like I've ever seen. Some of the extra tools are kinda useless, but that's because the vaccum doesn't really need them! I have a Dyson from 15 years ago that's still kicking, which makes me happy that I shelled out $500+ then and why I did it again for the newest model.
picks up all the hair
OH YEAH BABY, NOW WE'RE TALKING!!!  I admit, I have somewhat of an obsession about vacuum cleaners. I own five. I am always on a search for the best one out there. I found it. Granted, it does not have the retractable cord but I can live with that because this thing has the suction power of...well, use your imagination for that. I love this machine. For the price, it is WAY worth it!
omg  i just want to write this review for people who just want to know if it works as it should or not and not be side tracked buy litanies of personal opinions! that being said voila!! it works! Suction is awesome, I realized yesterday, that all this time I did not have a Dyson I lived in a DUMP! I had a kenmore before my daughter and me has long hair it was never cleaned up with that ,but with Dyson it's all gone, I emptied it 3 times!!!!, that how much stuff we had on the carpet,and we did vacuumed everyday .so there you have it! :-)
I had a Eureka for about 6 years and it did a good job but it couldn't handle the hair of my new Aussie Shephard. This new Dyson is unbelievable. Its more than I wanted to spend, but WOW, it is unbelievable. Well worth the money.
Excellent purchase  at first i hated this vacuum.  I could not figure out how to turn it on!!  I gave up and tired later ... once I figured out how to turn the thing on .. I love it.  It's light but powerful.  I'm older and the heavy vacuums wear me out.  This vacuum works great .. good suction power, good brushes and best of all is it's pretty easy to empty when full.
precisely what I needed  I saw this machine in action at a friend's home and immediately knew that it was the answer to my need for a light-weight, easy to manage, yet powerful vacuum cleaner.  The instruction book start-up instructions were relatively clear.  Ten minutes after it was out of the box, it was efficiently vacuuming the dining room carpet.  I've just used it once and so far I am delighted.
This is the best gadget I could have ever bought  This is the best gadget I could have ever bought. No more sweeping first and them mopping, it does it all in one. We have a new puppy in the house and it is doing a great job with the pet hair and all the dribbles. Easy to clean, and I like to see that it is cleaning up all the dirt. Love, love, love this. Great postage and delivery.
I used this vacuum like you wouldn't believe  After reviewing information about multiple vacuums online, I purchased this on clearance at a department store even though I wasn't sure this was the one I wanted.  We have only throw rugs and carpet on our stairs.  The rest of the house is linoleum, hard wood, wood laminate and painted cement floors in the basement.  I was only using a stick vac for the past 6 years until we came down with a flea problem.  I bought this to try to get it under control.  After flea bombing the house, I did a thorough cleaning from top to bottom, every room, every surface.  I used this vacuum like you wouldn't believe.  It is wonderful on hard floors, low carpet and upholstery.  I use the rolling brush attachment for the hard wood and the laminate.  Then I used the carpet attachment on hard floor setting for the linoleum and cement.  The carpet attachment works great on my throw rugs that can't go in the washer.  I think the dirt cup is ok size, I didn't mind emptying it often.  The cord could have been slightly longer, but again, I didn't mind moving it around.  I love the swivel function of the heads and that I can get under and around everything with relative ease.  I also used it on my walls.  I picked up lots of debris, it didn't like some things, coins, heavier or larger pieces of anything, but does any vacuum like them except  maybe a shop vac?  I really like that I can adjust the suction up or down.  When I used around my curtains, I could turn it down so it didn't suck in the whole curtain, or turned it up to make sure I got everything under the baseboards, etc.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this to someone that has all hard floors and maybe some low pile rugs.  It does the job that I needed it to and I used it almost constantly for 3 days.  Pros:  Worked great on all types of hard floors.  Moves easily, swivels nicely for getting under everything.  Suction is good.  Very easy to empty and clean filters.  Can turn off the power on the handle to stop and move furniture or change heads.  Cons:  Could have a slightly longer cord (not a big deal).
Keep bag cover snapped shut: power won't work.  We've used this model for 5 years & love it. Note that the newest model requires that the bag compartment is completely shut. If it snaps open, the power will not work. Simply ensure the bag cover is snapped shut. After troubleshooting power problem, I finally realized the cover wasn't tightly closed.
Like New  As said by others:  Arrived packed in original styrofoam, like new, not a scratch, everything works.  Minor inconvenience: remember to turn knob to return suction to bottom after using hose.
Very good vacuum
This was an amazing deal for the price  This was an amazing deal for the price. I have gone through multiple dysons which didn't make a dent in my dog hair but this one works great and I haven't had any issues yet.
The Best Ever Vacuum  Awesome, I cannot believe the way this shark works. I now know my other vacuum did not work like I thought it did after using the shark. It just seemed that years of dirt, dust and whatever came out of the rug so quickley, it is just amazing.
Good Price for a Bagless Vacuum  I am hard on Vacuum Cleaners - I had a different Dirt Devil 12-Amp vacuum, and it lasted exactly ONE cleaning of my house! This one is a lot better than that Bag-Based Vacuum. Now, I can keep my house CLEAN without fear of the motor burning out on this one.
Love the suction! Amazing what comes out of the carpet.
Bissell Barbie Vac is a winner in my book  I purchased the Bissell Barbie vac for my 8 yr old daughter. She absolutley loves it. Every little piece of crumb or paper that hits the floor she gets out her vac and it picks right up. The first day she got it I couldn't believe all the dust and hair from our cat it had picked up because I had just vaccumed the day before. It even came already charged just long enough for my daughter to test it out, about 15 min. I would definitely buy another one, and it's so easy for her to turn on, by pulling the handle down to vaccum position, and then off, by pushing back up to standing position.
I REAL LIKE IT!
I loved it  We recently changed our flooring to laminated and was looking for vacuum. This is the perfect vacuume. Light, easy operation, easy cleaning. It is powerful and i love the way it cleans the floor.  I could able to clean the whole house ( 3 level house ) in 15 mins with the vacuum. I just loved it.
Great buy  Exceptional
It's an Animal (in all respects)  This whole time I thought I was vacuuming my carpet...what was my weak vacuum doing and why was I wasting my time?  I picked up the Dyson from a popular retail home goods store for 20% off the MSRP.  Assembly was simple.  Snap the Quick-draw Telescope Reach(tm) wand into the flexible hose and fit the wand onto the body of the vacuum.  Remove various pieces of cardboard.  Vacuum.  I live in an apartment with two cats; one of which sheds a lot (we call him fur pants).  I had been using a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dirt-Devil-Featherlite-Bagless-Upright-Vacuum/dp/B002H0KXM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dirt Devil Featherlite Bagless Upright Vacuum</a>&nbsp;for about 3 years.  It picked up large pieces of dirt, and sometimes the smaller pieces.  We used it a lot to vacuum cat litter in the cat's room as well.  I've used the attachments a few times as well.  One thing I noticed about the Dirt Devil is that whenever I wanted to use an attachment or empty the canister, I had to practically prepare myself for an asthma attack.  Dirt and dust everywhere.  And the thing is...if I pull out an attachment to clean, the first thing I clean is the dirt that's made by disconnecting the hose from head to the attachment!  Anyway, ol' devil started to burn plastic and rubber when I ran it and I'd been looking for a toy.  I did a lot of research and almost went with the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bissell-5770-Healthy-Home-Bagless-Upright-Vacuum/dp/B000HS28AK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bissell 5770 Healthy Home Bagless Upright Vacuum</a>, but I'm a man who demands the highest quality products with proven results and reputation.  The Dyson DC28 Delivers.  My wife had vacuumed with the Dirt Devil 3 days before I vacuumed with the Dyson.  The Dyson picked up so much hair, dirt, dust, and debris embedded in the carpet that I filled the canister when vacuuming my living room and office.  Mind you, my apartment is only 720 sq ft.  I vacuumed the living room again to pick up even more dust, dirt, hair, and debris!  Amazing.  The flat out tool that comes with the DC 28 is amazing and is the most useful vacuum tool I've ever used.  Between my long arms and the reach of the telescope-reach wand, I was able to get all but 8 inches from one side of the bed.  I quickly went to the other and finished up the job.  The power of the machine is amazing, as well as the versatility of the machine and accessories.  My wife even dusted her shoes with the multi-use attachment brush head!  As you power on the machine and select the depth of carpet from the buttons on the base of the handle, the vacuum adjusts it's posture such that you can feel it literally clamp itself to the floor with relentless grip.  The power and weight remind me more of a carpet shampoo machine because it is so firm and weighted in it's engagement to the floor.  Some might complain that this vacuum is too heavy.  I would complain that they are too weak.  I am not a body builder - I am a regular person.  It's a little rougher, but I'm not soar or requiring days of recover to rebuild my muscular tissue.  It's not as big of a deal as some reviewers would have you believe.  The weight is a plus when using the attachments because you are less prone to knock it down when demanding reach and flexibility out of the hose.  If you're a lightweight (being less than 130 lbs) or are in horrible physical shape, get yourself a Dyson DC24.  If not, get the DC28.  This is the first time vacuuming has been both effective and fun.
love it
Very good choice!!!  It's a great product!!!
Love this vacuum! :)  Love this vacuum! Reminds me of my friend's dyson, but it's way cheaper and works just as well, if not better. I had a different model vacuum that had no swivel on it and this is much easier to maneuver. Took a little getting used to but I love it! My favorite feature is the 'kompressor' that compresses the dirt and packs it in tighter so you don't have to empty it as often. The wand release is easy to use and the cord length reaches through our whole house so I don't have to change outlets. It also has a light on the front, which our old one didn't have. Plus it had an upholstery attachment that works great too on our couch. I love vacuuming! Lol! Who says that?!? Someone with this awesome vacuum! :)
Love my ne Dyson  Thought my vacuum cleaner was doing a pretty good job, when I used my new Dyson for the first I had to empty the canister twice while vacuuming, I could not believe the amount of dirt it picked up.  I would recomment this to anyone who wants a efficient, powerful vacuum
This Bissell is the bizzell fo shizzel.  I was standing in Target trying to decide on which vacuum to get.  This one had 4 to 4.5 stars and decent reviews, so I purchased it from Target as I was in a rush to clean and could not wait for shipping.  This vacuum picked up so much dirt and dog hair out of my carpet that my old Dyson had left behind that I was amazed, even though I just vacuumed yesterday.  Some negative comments were that it is heavy and hard to push, but It is not. It is harder to pull back because the brushes are seriously spinning and pulling the vacuum along and therefore really working the fibers.  My carpet looks like new.  Even more impressive was how it did on the area rug in my foyer that seriously gripped the dog hair like velcro,  I used to have to drag a rubber squeegee along that rug to pull the hair out since my old Dyson did nothing on that rug. This vacuum did the job so quickly.  I love it. I recommend it.
this works great
snail service  Arrived on time well packaged .on opening and assembling the handle. Plugged the unit in and a strong burning smell,when attempting to use the power movement. Opened up the bottom and a broken belt. called hoover and the customer service said that two belts would be sent.. After one week went and purchased a belt from local store and started using the cleaner. I like the unit and it works well. the belts did arrive about two weeks after the report of the problem. Lousy service
Very pleased  We are very happy with our new Floor Cleaner.  My husband thought our floors were already clean after using a steamer, but when we ran the FloorMate the water revealed a very different story.  Easy to use, lightweight and does the job on our tile floor.  Glad we made the purchase.
Great and Simple  Of the many Vacs I've owned, this one is the easiest to use, works better than any I've had, is light weight enough to carry and move around and the bag change couldn't be easier. Noise level is low and as at least one other reviewer pointed out, a LOT quieter than the Dirt Devil. Tornado-type vacs are a mess and way too expensive. I've had mine for a year and I'm glad they're still available because I may buy one for a friend (usually you can't buy the same thing twice in America...ever notice that?) This little gem really is a bargain. One little flaw: it doesn't come with a standard 8 or 10" wide stair/upholstery attachment...just a little mini one, but you can buy the larger ones cheap. BUY THIS VAC!
It really IS all it's cracked up to be!!!  I've been wanting a Dyson vacuum for a long time now and I was finally able to afford one thanks to the many Lowes gift certificates my husband and I received for Christmas.  I couldn't wait, so we went yesterday to get it.  I'd originally wanted to get the DC17 Animal b/c of all the pet hair we have from our Boxer, but decided instead on the DC14 since most of our flooring is wood or tile.  I figured that if the majority of the flooring was carpet I could better justify the $130 price difference, but since I mostly wanted it for our area rugs and bare floors I decided that the DC14 would probably suffice.  Well, let me tell you...it DID NOT disappoint!!!  I first tested it on our main area rug in the living room (same rug my husband had just vacuumed the day before with our poor performing Dirt Devil).  I could not believe the amount of hair and dirt our old vacuum had left behind.  That rug is 5x7 and the Dyson's canister was nearly half full!  Gross!  So of course that made want to vacuum the rest of the entire house.  I vacuumed baseboards, blinds, above all the doors...everything!  My husband said that if he'd known that this vacuum was going to get me so excited to clean he would have bought one for me a long time ago.  :o) I highly highly highly recommend this vacuum cleaner.  It does not disappoint!  Happy cleaning!!!
Excellwnt and light weight.  Does the job perfectly!
Loves my Black Lab Fur  Excellent!!!!  Have mostly laminate and ceramic tile floors and a Black Labrador starting his seasonal shedding.  The hair is flying, and this powerful little vacuum gets it all up.  I pretty much need to vacuum every day in the Fall and Spring and this is doing a very good job.  It also works well on my low pile carpets.
Great product  Great product, light weight and easy to use.
Favorite Vacuum!  I am usually an Orek customer, but wow, this vacuum has taken the cake.  I love it, love it, love it!  It leaves behind no dust or crumbs.  The detachable wand is awesome, I wish it was about 6 inches longer though, but to have that feature on an upright is great.  The filter system is easy to change, we had a Bissell and it was difficult and messy.  I use this on mostly wood floors and some indoor/outdoor carpet.  My new house used to have cats in it (which I am allergic to) and it does a great job getting cat hair even out of baseboard radiators and teeny spots that it doesn't quite fit into...good suction power.
sweet  Great performance and a pretty color on top of that. It also handles well. I actually like vacuuming with this one. That should be enough of an endorsement.
As good as the older Kenmore canisters  This is my third progressive Kenmore vacuum canister.  After reading disappointing reviews on the higher priced progressives, I settled on this very bright colored canister.  This has not been updated with the telescoping wand and it is smaller, more compact and lighter than my 10 yo Progressive that died, but those are GOOD things.  The tube is still steel, the attachments are located in the canister, not on the wand itself.  AND, it takes the (longer) hose from my old progressive canister, along with the much longer/beefier attachments.  The old beater bar attachment works, too!  And the price is so much less than the top of the line!  I Love this vacuum cleaner and so glad I ignored the interesting color when I decided on my purchase.
LOVE THIS!  Bought for a short term apartment I needed for work.  Kept it when I got home to do my carpeted areas.  Amazing what it picks up.  Small, easy to use.
I purchased the tile and grout brushes to use.  I'm very happy with the product and pleased that I had purchased the brushes.  It worked great!!
awesome vacuum
Amazingly effective with good battery life and light weight.  Very pleased.
love it...  Does a very good job and easy to use. Two days later there was a $15.00 coupon I would have liked to use.
Wonderful machine!  Does a wonderful job on our porcelain tile.  I have some third party ( TECH Enterprises ) Grout Cleaner that is miraculous.  I soak the grout and brush as required to remove all stains and then use the FloorMate scrubber.  The floors look like they did when installed 10 years ago.  I wish I had bought a FloorMate many years ago. This is so much better than being on your knees and doing all the hard scrubbing we did before.  After doing the initial deep cleaning and resealing the grout, I can clean our kitchen floor and have it dry and useable in less than 30 minutes.  Cleaning out the dirty water tank is very therapeutic to enforce that you have done a good job. Wonderful product esp. for us older or Arthritic owners. Very easy to use. Highly recommend it to anyone.
That's good enough for me  The cleaning lady likes it.  That's good enough for me!  The price was very competitive and the attachments that are included makes this an outstanding value.
Really liked the vacuum. The only thing I didn't like was the short electric cord.
Nice!  Works great, easy to use, light & easy to move & carry.
It does a wonderful job because the suction is great  It does a wonderful job because the suction is great.  The only problem I have is that I have to empty it every other time BECAUSE it does such a good job.
This is my second Hoover Tempo Widepath Upright  Compared to the previous one that lasted 2 years at US$68, the new one is of thinner plastic; does not have a cap attached to the attachment host; but the cable is about a foot longer so that you could cover a larger area without unplugging. Since the plastic is thinner, it is lighter to carry around. I put an old sock in the attachment host and that works well. As a matter of fact, it works even better than the old design with a cap because the cap is loose and I often opened it by accident and dust will come off all over. I use the attachemnt tools to vacuum hard floor and it is fine with me. The suction power is still as strong as before. So all in all, I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a good basic household vacuum cleaner at a reasonable price.
Great! Just what I was hoping for.  This vacuum is light weight, quiet and easy to use.  Base swivels around furniture and is low enough to get under sofa and chairs. Cleaned carpet really well without tearing it up as my old vacuum did.  Love that it can be used with or without brush --- brush for carpet, without brush for hard floors. Hose attachment not as long as some other vacuums but very serviceable for my needs.  Filter is washable - saves time and aggravation! Only negative is that canister is smaller than most but that's a fair trade-off for its manageable size. Really glad I took a chance on buying this one instead of others that I saw!
LIke New out of the Box  LIke New out of the Box!! A little different than most so takes a little getting used to but now it is fine. Solid suction that is great!!  I would recommend!!
Good vacuum, good price  We needed a new vacuum and after shopping all the major brands we decided on the Dirt Devil based on reviews and price. Works great and my wife likes how light and easy it operates.
Very nice machine and happy wife  It works very well. you need to do the maintenance if you expect a long life machine. very pleased.
I really like how much it cleans  I really like how much it cleans, but would not use it every time I clean my floors....  It is very time consuming and heavy to use, besides the refills of cleaning fluid and discarding dirty water is a nuisance.....  I like my steam mop for in between  deep cleanings....  I think if you started using this as soon as you have new floors, the grout for tile floors would not get so dirty if used periodically...  We are an older retired couple, so our floors don't get as dirty as when we had small kids....  I did like how it sucked all the water up real nicely...  I also have dark grout lines that only show very little in getting dirty which is a great benefit...  If I had white grout, then I would use it every time I think....  But I would not be happy about that, since the time to clean will be much longer.....  I only used it once so far....  On some of the reviews here, some people said that the grout lines get cleaner as you use it more....  It does save you from scrubbing grout lines by hand...  That is a big plus...
I love this vacuum  Eureka!!!  I love this vacuum...it is almost a fun chore now with this Eureka Boss Smart-vac.  I should first mention that about 6 or 7 years ago i bought my first version of this vacuum.  Although the models are similar, there seems to be many improvements.  The price is fantastic.  The suction is great as expected. The newer features include more floor/carpet height adjustments.  I did not specifically focus on the features, but it also came with this hose extension end-piece called a carpet claw for vertical and horizontal brush suction as a hose attachment.  This might be very handy for removing dust off off textured walls or blinds...looking forward to using it in many applications.  I see a lot of reviews on this model and others and I am a repeat buyer with complete satisfaction.  I had prior Kennmore and Hoover models that never either had good suction or simply did not last long.  Highly recommend and would buy another one.  My last one did not break, just was in the mood for a new unit and figured we could keep one upstairs and one downstairs....or i might use one for the garage (vacuum and maintain the cars).
Great vacuum.  Was on back order but kept me notified with updates. Great vacuum.
Awesome  Great vacuum and price. Wife loves it and so do I.
good sweeper love it
Awesome, well worth the money !  I got a great deal on this and I am so happy I purchased it! I have owned a Hoover Wind Tunnel(a consumers report best buy) and a Kirby in the past. This far exceeds both of them. I have 5 cats and this thing sucks the hair right out of the carpet and it makes your carpet look brand new. The vacuum is heavy if you are carrying it from place to place, but once you turn it on it is very easy to push, unless you are a young child or weigh less then like 50 lbs. you should be able to handle it. With my old vacuum my 3 year old carpet looked old and worn down, just one day of running the animal over it , it has come back to life.
The best vacuum I have used  Not too loud, works great. Shockingly light weight. Would recommend to friends. The added canister vacuum is also nice for quick cleaning or high spots.
easy to clean  I loooove this vacuum. easy to clean.
Dyson DC25  Easy asssembly and operation. Limited space needed to store. Great design for storing vacuum attachments and filters. Lightweight and easy to maneuver. Love it!!
best vacuum in the world. this is my 2nd one and picks up everything
Product review  I was surprised for as little as I paid how much I enjoy this product!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND...I was shocked.  I was gonna use it as a reserve but share duty with my Dyson.  THANKS ALOT!
Great Vacuum!  OMG! I love this vacuum cleaner! The suction is incredible and handles massive quantities of dog hair with ease!  It is so lightweight that I can vacuum and carry it at the same time without difficulty.  My home is average sized but the cord is so long that I can vacuum most of it without stopping to unplug and replug. The hose is lightweight plastic and seems to be a concern for most of the reviewers but it doesn't seem as though it will present a problem for me. Not only would I recommend this vacuum to everyone but I know I'll purchase the same model if this one goes out.
hard floor cleaner  This is such a useful cleaner!  i have 3 rescue dogs and a rescue cat.  Most of my floors are hard surface (tile) thank goodness!  My age is catching up with me and the constant cleaning was becoming more of a physical chore.  I have a Hoover carpet cleaner that is about 15 years old and has been a real workhorse but also beginning to show its age (like me!)  In looking at potentially replacing it to clean the tile floors I found this Hoover Hard Floor Cleaner.  It appeared to fit what I need and I am very glad I ordered it.  It is very easy to use, light weight, the clean and dirty water containers are easy to remove and empty/refill.  I like that the dirty water and cleaning solution are kept separate so that all the goes on the floor is clean.  I am seeing a cleaner grout as well as enjoying a greater ease in cleaning the floors.  No more wringing mops for me!  The cleaner came packaged very wellhad a bit of a time getting it out of the box because everything was braced and protected but that was a good thing.  It was delivered on time and I could hardly wait to give it a try.  I love it!
User-friendly, quiet, and functional -- all-around great vacuum  UPDATE: After more than a year of use, this vacuum is as good as it was when brand new. The bungee cord tool storage still befuddles me, and I still don't use it, but otherwise I find the vacuum were well designed with excellent ergonomics.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: Purchasing a new vacuum to replace a tortured old one was an impossibly difficult decision. There is no clear standout vacuum in the crowd, and things only get more complicated when sifting through upright vs. canister and bagged vs. bagless.  I've never had a canister vacuum, but I figured that there must be a compelling performance reason why manufacturers still make them and consumers still buy them, despite the ubiquity of uprights. This vacuum proves that there is a good reason to go canister: I was able to suck sand from a hard surface through an area rug and into the canister on medium power.  Bagged vacuums are cleaner, but I happen to like to convenience of never running out of bags and the savings associated with not having to buy bags. This vacuum empties easily and without a cloud of debris, so I am pleased.  Build quality: there is actually metal used in this construction along with high-quality, non-brittle hard plastics. Using the vacuum, I can imagine that this is not a "disposable" vacuum, but rather something that can easily last a decade or more. Tools are simple and easy to use, the controls are logical, and not crowded with unnecessary buttons or switches, and it stores easily.  The bungee cord tool storage contraption is befuddling and I don't use it, but when stretched around the canister body, it is excellent for preventing dings and scrapes on wall surfaces.
Great Vacuum  My wife and I have had many vacuums before this one, and purchased a refurbished one on Amazon.  Yes, it is expensive, but we feel that it is worth it.  It is the only one that can totally suck up all the dog hair our puggle leaves around the house.  It is very easy to empty, easier than other bagless vacuums.  It seems like no dirt is left in the can after emptying... I can't say the same about the previous vacuums we have.
Beats my very expensive Dyson coming and going!  This vacuum is far superior in handling ease and picking up pet hair than my previous extremely expensive Dyson.  It's easy to empty and is miraculous in ability to get pet hair out of rugs or off hardwood floors.  I love it and highly recommend it!
Excelent  It's a good product, all that you can expect about it is in there. A perfect soundless vacuum machine is still a dream in the human kind, but this product is kind of close to that.
Love this vacuum!  Girlfriend and I decided to replace an old hoover bagged vacuum with this one. We went through all of our options including the dyson and other more expensive models. After reading all of the positive reviews on this vacuum we decided why not give it a try and save some cash. Glad we did because this vacuum SUCKS! Ok it actually is completely rocking, and we are 100% happy with our vacuum and amazons fast delivery and no sales tax.
Works great! Removes all dust from the floor.
It's a Dream!  First, I purchased this on Target.com for hundreds less, just sayin', but there review system isn't working right now... so here I am. Even spending much less, I was still weary of spending so much for a vacuum. I have 2 cats. I think I do a good job of keeping up with the cat hair and my house is pretty clean (I'm no Martha Stewart, but so far no one has died). Anyway, I can't believe how much dirt this thing picks up that is NOT visible to the naked eye. Fine dirt. Dust. It is amazing. No to mention cat hair. It does rugs just as well as hard woods. It snaps together in seconds. I would never regret this purchase ( I am glad I paid less though...) I'd say this is a must have if you have pets. I can't believe I waited so long. So happy!!
This will be my third one!  This little light weight Dirt Devil Swivel Glide vacuum REALLY SUCKS!!!  Seriously!  I have 3 cats and a dog and it picks up their hair like no other expensive vacuum has! I have been in my house 7 years and this will be my third Dirt Devil Swivel vac.  Wouldn't buy anything else! It is easy to empty and keep clean.  The other 2 vacuums still work really good but the button that you step on to lower the handle has broken on both of them.  The first one is kept in the garage for my car which is ALWAYS vacuumed clean and the second one is down in the basement.  I really think for the price this is a good little vacuum!!
Wow!  Bought this direct from Amazon: fast standard shipping and great price!  In regards to the vacuum, WOW!  My wife and I are both amazed at how much dirt our old vacuum left in the carpets.  This thing was pulling out lots of dirt for the first 6 times we vacuumed.  The vacuum is really quite, moves easy and the controls on the handle are great!  Can't comment on the durability since we've only had it a month but if it lasts it will be one of the best vacuums I've ever used!
Hoover  The hoover has great suction and picks up more dirt than my previous vacuum.  The only downside is the weight, it is heavier than I thought it would be.  It does have a setting for self-propelling which is necessary. Amazon shipped quickly.
It very good
Great vacuum for hardwood floors and works great on carpets as soon as you purchase a carpet attachment.  Love the vacuum; wish it came with a carpet attachment (rather than have to buy one).  But, it's quiet and efficient.
This is a perfect little vac  This is a perfect little vac.  If you don't ask it to do something it was not meant to do you will be happy.
Great product!  We use these for my cleaning business and they work great!
CINETICMF...least expensive of the Cinetic Big Ball line. Awesome!  Not much info about this machine on the net and not listed on the Dyson website. I picked one at the local Electronics Express. Works great! Appears to be the least expensive of the Cinetic Big Ball line.
I love this vacuum  I read reviews from several web sites about different vacuums and chose the Eureka 4870MZ and I love it. I know it was refurbished and that doesn't matter to me as long as it works. I have three kids and there friends, they all play sports, I vacuum my living room three times a day and the kitchen at least twice. This vacuum has great suction, easy to put together, easy to use, perfect. I would recommend this vacuum to everyone.
good and light weight  cant beat the price and great suction. weak point is the bar keeps turning when you lock the handle and use the hose so it could wear a spot on the carpet it you left it on a long long time. This is our second one first lasted about 5 yrs.
Great purchase  So far wonderful vac. Great suction. Love the 40 foot cord. Purchased for 90 dollars. Best price locally was 140.00.
Fantastic little vac - Prefer to both Dyson's I have  I had this vac for 7 or so years (until I moved and foolishly left it behind), and despite a few of its odd quirks I absolutely loved it. I currently live in a house with two different Dyson vacuums, but I am desperately missing my old Optima and will probably be buying a new one without much compunction, since they are a) so cheap, and b) so small and easy to store.  This vacuum has a great deal of suction power, is super lightweight as well as very compact, and has simple and basic functions, which it performs quite well. It is not loaded with bells and whistles, it is just a straightforward piece of equipment at a very low price, and I think it is a great deal.  One of the functions I most often used this vac for was dusting... it really worked great for that. The small brush would loosen the dust from any surface, and the excellent suction would suck it right up. With the Dysons I run into frustrating problems when trying to dust... 1) The angle of the Dyson brush attachments forces you to position the hose well above the surface being dusted. Whereas the near-right-angle of the Optima's brush lets you easily dust things which are either high up (such as mantles, tops of ceiling fans, and shelves or other surfaces at chest-height and above) or in close quarters (such as dusting in between the shelves in a bookcase or entertainment center). 2) The bristles of the Dyson brushes are both too long and too soft to effectively brush up the dust; they tend to just bend out of the way as the suction sucks the plastic lip of the tool down to the surface, which could easily mar many materials, and no dust gets lifted. Whereas the Optima bristles are sturdy enough to brush dust out of all kinds of surfaces, and soft enough to not scratch anything, while the suction is perfect to suck it all away.  In general I have found that the Dysons have a great deal of suction, but they also have design flaws which make that suction basically useless when trying to use the hose/attachments - it becomes more of a hindrance than a help. If you have strong suction but no airflow, then nothing is actually going to move (which is just not cool when you're trying to vacuum up that scary spider, or anything else for that matter). This is a problem I am constantly trying to overcome, and something that was never an issue with my trusty little Optima. I'm guessing that the Dysons *might* be doing a better job at sucking dirt out of the carpets (since they should be getting airflow through the carpet fibers), but for all other tasks I would rather have the Optima. Also, the Optima was far better at vacuuming under furniture because it has a small head and the body could bend very far back to get under things. And for getting waaaay back under things I could use the hose with the brush attachment. The Dysons fail on all of these counts.  The one main caveat is the issue about the Optima's vent - it does indeed vent right out the front of the vac, so if you have the front pointed in the direction you want to clean then you are liable to blow away whatever's there. But if you are conscious of this issue, then you can generally avoid it. When vacuuming floors, just make sure you have tilted the vacuum body back (into vacuuming position, so that the vent is pointing skyward-ish) before starting the vac. And if you're dusting things, then just make sure the front of the vac is pointed away from what you want to dust before turning it on. I can't say it hasn't gotten me now and then, but most of the time I haven't found it to be a real problem. And I certainly feel that the vac's merits outweigh this relatively minor annoyance.  One other thing that I might appreciate is an extension wand, to make it easier to dust high spots (like ceilings and walls) without resorting to a step-stool, and low spots (like baseboards and stairs) without having to crouch down. Again, I find this to be a fairly minor issue.  Regarding the filter - I only ever owned the filter that came with my initial purchase. When it would get clogged I would simply clear all of the big clumps out with a toothpick or other pointy object, and bang the dust out of it out at the dumpster, and the suction would be good as new. If you're not interested in dealing with this kind of maintenance then you can just invest in more filters. If you don't mind this kind of messy task, then one filter will probably last you quite a long time.  Bottom line: A) I would NEVER buy another Dyson - they are far too useless for the outlandish price. B) I will most certainly be buying another Optima - it's a great little vacuum for a super price (and I love the green color, but I'll even buy a yellow one if I have to).  Important notes: 1) This is probably not the vac for you if vacuuming carpet is your only/primary need - it does a fine job at that, but there are likely better vacuums for that task. 2) If you have wood floors and some rugs then this guy will work great for you (provided you mind the vent). 3) If you like the idea of being able to vacuum the dust off of most all of your surfaces (rather than rubbing it in with dust cloths, or swooping it into the air with dusters - yes, even swiffer dusters tend to just push it around or launch it into the air) then this vac is a must. Just consider how cheap it is compared to a lifetime of swiffer cloths/dusters. 4) If you don't have much money, but you need a vacuum, this puppy is a great way to go - a multi-tasker and really great bang for your buck. (Also, you can usually get these at Bed Bath & Beyond for around $60, and get one of their 20% off coupons making this an even bigger steal.)
AMAZEBALLS  Ummmmmmm, AMAZING! I love this little vacuum. It is a normal loudness, no different than other vacuums. For something so small and affordable I cannot believe how well it works. I feel like I empty a whole other 5lb chihuahua every time I dump out the dog hair. I just have a small 400sqf condo, but pretty much all carpet. I love this machine!
This works better than the $400 Dyson I bought at Costco.
It arrived on time in excellent condition.  It is light weight and easy to manuver especially for two 70 year olds.  My wife loves it.
King of the small vacuums !  This is just a FANTASTIC little vacuum. Keep it out of the way of your drapes. LOL  I have a Dyson Animal vacuum and it's GREAT  for the floors, but if you have a lot of dust and cobwebs in your area, THIS IS the vacuum you need. Great for corners and hard to reach spots with a more than ample amount of suction, a really nice tool holder mounted right ON the unit , easy to change bags and it's lightweight ! I would not even shop around if you are in the market for a small vacuum for your home and/or car. Happy cleaning !
Excellent on hardwood floors.  I c Great an't believe all the dirt it collected.  Great product.
It's just the top of the line - enjoy  Easy to steer with one hand  -- Thorough rug cleaning as well as bare floors  -- removes cat hairs from upholstered furniture and rugs  -  dust, dirt, cat hair dumps into waste barrel with no residue  - convenient handles for carrying up stairs - it's a breeze to work with, what else could you want,and it's obvious that the molded plastic parts are heavy-duty; not going to break or chip or crack,
Very impressed with DC07  We received our Dyson DC07 a couple of weeks ago.  Having read many of the reviews,  we are puzzled about reports of difficulty "putting it together" out of the box.  We are definitely NOT mechanically inclined and it took about 10 minutes max to get it going.  First pass through the house filled up the bin, with carpet fluff and dirt!  Emptying the bin was a snap.  It is heavy but less than our Hoover which it replaces.  Love the reversible stretchable tubing so we can put the vacuum at the bottom of the stairs and vacuum all the way up without moving it. Also purchased the low-rise tool for cleaning under beds and furniture. Called the customer service line to register the new 5 year warranty and the response was courteous and helpful.  We are really pleased with our purchase.
Dynamite Vacuum  Pick's up dog hairs great and handles much better on the stairs then are old vacuum.
Great purchase  We use this vac for almost a year now. It is very light and has great wheels so that it moves effortlessly, has very powerful suction, and the extensions are great. I think this is the best canister vac we have ever had. As always there is some room for improvement; the hose could be slightly more rigid for such a powerful vacuum. Every now and then, when bent too hard the hose collapses, but it corrects itself while running when hose position is corrected.
Extremely well designed vacuum  I've been using this vacuum for over 6 months now and I still really like it.  This is the first "nice" vacuum cleaner that I have owned, and I must say that it is worth every penny when compared to my previous Hoover/Bissell/generic vacuum.  I would recommend this specific canister style vacuum to anyone with hard floors and pets.  The canister style is very convenient. I like that the head doesn't have a rotor brush because I have an old house with original hardwood floors that I don't want damaged.  It works equally well on my few rugs and low pile carpet.  The floor head glides effortlessly over my wood floors and rugs and can lay almost completely flat for cleaning under the sofa and bed. The good: -Quiet! Its so quiet that I often second guess myself if I turned it on.  It has a dial that decreases the motor speed and makes it even quieter.  My dog isn't scared of it. -Light! It moves around effortlessly on it's casters and I can easily hold it while cleaning stairs.  Great for cleaning out the car because it's small. -Powerful! I have pets and I can watch the "tumble fluffs" get sucked up from 6 inches away from the head.  Does a great job of getting the hair out of my rugs. I sometimes dial down the power when cleaning my rugs so the rug doesn't stick to the head. -Accessories! The accessories/detachable heads are all well made and useful.  The upholstery cleaner head is really convenient. -Well made! Those Germans don't let anything by them! It looks great and it feels really solid.  I love the way the attachments and hoses make a reassuring "click" when they lock in. Everything fits together well and none of the materials feel cheap. There are two head holders for storing the hose that show real ingenuity in product design. Small concerns for consideration: -Short cord.  I have a small house and I need to unplug and move the cord several times.  I wouldn't recommend it for a big house. -Full bag indicator.  This is the biggest gimmick I've ever seen.  It seems like an afterthought on an extremely well thought out product.  It works on suction, so if you plug the hose it'll show that the bag is full.  I assume the theory is that if the bag is full then you have the same effect.  Well, I have thrown away 3 bags now that are completely stuffed with dust/hair/grit and the indicator hasn't moved the slightest.  I can't imagine much more could fit, but perhaps I'm wrong. Replacing the bags is easy and fairly inexpensive, so I just prefer to err on replacing it and ignoring the indicator. (see next). -The bags. I don't really have a problem with this, but know that you'll have regular maintenance to do with this vacuum including changing the bags and filters.  It is simple to do and honestly not that expensive.  With pets and fairly regular use, I have been replacing my bags every couple of months.  They are much easier and neater to deal with than the plastic dump bins on most other vacuums.  I always hated the dust cloud that emerged from the trash can when emptying my old vacuum cleaner and I don't have to change these bags nearly as often as dumping the bin. This is as simple as removing the bag and throwing it away- no mess.  The official Miele bags are very sturdy and well made; I almost feel bad throwing them away.  If you want a high quality vacuum cleaner for hard floors, you won't go wrong with this product.
so good. I've only had it for about a month  So far, so good.  I've only had it for about a month, but it works very well.  We finally wore out our upright Dyson, which we had for many years.  I no longer have carpets, and wanted the ability to reach and get under things that a canister can offer.  It's taking me a bit to get used to a whole new feel to vacuuming, but I think this is a winner.
It works, Updated November 2006  I have to say that I was impressed with the animal. We have two dogs a bird and two kids so there is plenty to pick up. I have always had commercial type vacs that are heavy but do the job ok. This vac works extremely well. No bags no mess just results. Doing the stairs was actually very easy. We have 80% wall to wall but this worked just as well on bare floors too. It is worth it so far. My $.02  It STILL WORKS!!!
fantastic  I bought this 2 years ago and use it at least once a month if not more often.  My friend recommended it and after reading the reviews I was sold.  Especially when one of the comments suggested getting it at best buy and buying their service contract.  The top tank has busted and leaked twice and they have replaced it within a weeks time both times.  The cleaner itself is great.  Go over carpet just as it suggests, 2 times with the cleaner and water, then 3-4 times just to suck up the extra water.  The first section I do is dry by the time I finish up the room.  Juice stains from sippy cups come up the first time around, dog accidents usually take 2-3 times for the yellow to come out.
Loved the vacuum cleaner  Loved the vacuum cleaner!  Got up alot of cat hair that I didn't realize was there as I used my other vacuum alot!
Hoover Steamvac Supreme  This carpet cleaner works great!  It was easy to use and did not leak.  I bought it at a fracton of the cost that it sells for at local retail stores from Amazon/AllergyBeGone.  Shipping was unbelievably fast as well-it came 2-3 days earlier than I expected!  I read multiple reviews prior to purchasing this cleaner and am very pleased with the quality and the cleaning job it did on my carpets.
Good vacuum  Does everything we ask of it. Picks up pet hair, easy to use, really long cord, easy to empty. Works great on our vehicle interiors.
Easy to operate!  The best part is how easy it goes from carpet to tile!!! Light enough, maneuverable enough, does a good job, easy to move around and store. I usually don't enjoy getting the vacuum out for a small job, and keep buying those small cordless, that less like a month, but this one - no problem. I remember using the older model at my friends house and remember it being heavier. Looks like this model is upgraded and much lighter! Pricey? Yes. But there is an expression - we are not reach enough to buy cheap thing!
LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!! & You will too if you own it.  I got this great machine as a christmas gift last November.  It is a wonderful machine and I want all to know great investment since i had an old Hoover for over 13 years it still works but this ones the best.  So light weight and portable easy to empty.
So far all good.  So far so great! Simple smart design,decent suction......hope it stands the test of time....
Once you go wireless, you won't go back  I've been using this Anker HomeVac for a few weeks now, as I was able to get it on a discount from the company directly.  How do I use it? I keep the HomeVac stationed into the dock by our breakfast nook where we have all our meals. Since we have 3 kids less than 5 years old, each meal results in plenty of crumbs on the ground, so now I vacuum the area pretty much every day. If the seats get dirty with crumbs (which happens pretty frequently), then I pop out the handvac and get at the seats that way. Every few days (which is way more often that I was vacuuming before because it's been such a hassle until now), I vacuum the rest of my home. I was a tad bit nervous that the battery wouldnt last for me to cover my whole home (1800 sq ft) but i haven't had any issues so far.  I've been using a Dyson (non rollerball version) for the last 6 years and a Neato BotVac D85 for a few months now.  vs. Old Dyson (non rollerball) The Anker HomeVac is way less cumbersome to use than the Dyson. While the Dyson does a great job of getting at our crumbs, dust bunnies, etc across hard wood and rugs, it's always a hassle to pull it out of the closet as it's relatively heavy, and also to have to plug in and out of outlets through each zone of our home.. The Anker HomeVac is a slim profile, and even folds up to get smaller when not in use, so we just leave it on a dock and leave it outside of the closet. The HomeVac maneuverability is great (especially relative to the older Dyson we had). The best part IMO is that it's wireless so I don't have to disrupt the actual vacuuming to remove the plug and hunt for a new outlet in the next area.  UPDATE (July 2016): Downgrading from 5 stars to 2. After about 3 months of use of this vacuum, the spinning mechanism on the brush stopped working. It's too bad as we used this vacuum all the time because it was so light and easy to maneuver--and ready to go since it was always charged. Now that the brush doesn't spin, it has a hard time picking up most crumbs, hairs, carpet fuzz, etc. The only way we can use it currently is as a hand vac. I had reached out to the manufacturer to get some support a few weeks back but have not yet heard back.  UPDATE (August 2016): Regrading to 5 stars out of 5. I was contacted by customer support upon reading my update in this product review, and they let me know that my unit was likely a lemon and replaced the unit free of charge. The new unit I have is working as it originally was (which was great if you read my original review above). Unless the quality diminishes in the near-term or I run into similar mechanical issues on a second unit, I would give the company the benefit of the doubt that the unit was in fact a defect.
Very satisfied  Easy to assemble good suction and light weight. Very satisfied.
I love it  This vacuum cleaner is the beast. You can see all the dirt it is pulling up. You can switch from vacuuming the floor to using the extension within seconds. I love it
Bare floors and cats  I am the owner of 5 cats (I know way to many cats)and over the last 7 years I have purchase 4 vacuums, plus a sweeper broom and various dust mops. The vacuums had brushes and scattered litter everywhere managing to get about half of what was on the floor. The canister vacuums was to much trouble and really didn't get the litter either.  The Bissell Versus Bare-Floor Vacuum does exactly what it's suppose to do. It cleans up the litter and cat hair.  It's 12V motor is perfect.  I can even get the hair off my rug in the family room.  I would probably use my vacuum with the rotating brush for a more through cleaning but the Versus is good for a quick pickup.  Some people have downgraded the Versus because they think the cord is to short.  Yes the cord could be longer but that's not what I bought it for.  They have also marked it down because it looks funny and they feel it's hard to get use to the head's movement.  To me it moves like a dust mop, so is not problem. It has been marked down because you might have to bend down and remove hair from the brushes or because it sometimes blows the hair around. Even with a few minor issues it is still the best vacuum I have owned, so buy it while you can, because Bissell has discontinued it and most stores don't carry it anymore. Pluses 1) It's corded you don't have to charge it and it has more power.  2) It has a hose and crevice tool, most chargeable vacs don't have this. and 3) The dirt container holds a lot and is easy to empty. One last thought, when you are assembling the vacuum be sure to look at the "foot" or head.  Mine had a roll of cardboard pushed into the hole that dirt and hair is sucked into.  I had put mine together to try out, well it was sucking up some stuff but leaving quite a bit of litter on the floor.  I was very disappointed in how it was working.  When I turned it over and pulled out the cat hair I noticed the cardboard stuffed into the hold.  I removed it and wow, it really worked :) So be sure to check for the cardboard.
Yes the Bissell works well and is exactly what I was looking for.
got delivered within two days and works great!!  It was inexpensive, got delivered within two days and works great!!
love it just the right size. fits in the closet with no problem.
Very pleased! Hope it holds up  This vaccuum is the bomb! I was nervous to buy it because it was so inexpensive compared to others on here. I had a full canister from just my bedroom alone and I vaccuum weekly! Very pleased! Hope it holds up!
but am very pleased with it  I've only used it a couple of times so far, but am very pleased with it. Great job scrubbing tile floors and dries them completely
... OCD Brother for his Birthday and he fell in love after his first use  I brought this for my OCD Brother for his Birthday and he fell in love after his first use.  He won't let his wife or children use it LOL
Just as good as everyone said it was!  I can't really add much to what the other 200+ reviewers have said, but I love my Dyson animal so much I wanted to give it the 5 stars it deserves. I actually enjoy vacuuming as much as it is possible to enjoy housework now that I have the Dyson. I have three kids and two dogs, so I can fill up the cannister with dirt, hair, and dust almost every day. It clearly picks up much more than my old vacuum and I love not having to worry about bags. All the tools work the way they should and it's very easy to use them after looking at the directions. It's also easy to empty and to clear blockages. My only small complaint is the lack of a retractable cord. But it's so pretty the way it is, maybe they shouldn't change anything even for this convenience.
If You Have a Dog that Sheds...  We have two 28-pound Corgis that shed constantly--such that vacuuming is a daily chore. The amount dog hair picked up each time is unbelievably large--full canister. Dyson Animals work well. We now have four--one for each floor in two houses. We started with one and just kept making the decision to get another to avoid carrying them upstairs and down. Our first, several years ago, had to be replaced (under warranty) due to a defect that became apparent when a cleaning lady, since fired, abused the vacuum cleaner.
Does a wonderful job.
GET OUT!  We just got our Dyson today. It was a Christmas present from my husbands parents.  What an amazing gift!  It is an unbelieveable-unless-you-see-it type of great.  We decided to put it to work right away and sweep the house. I was continuously disgusted at how much dirt it accumulated and how many times we emptied the container.  I realized our other sweepers never really cleaned our house.  We have two springer spaniels and tend to sweep often because of the hair that does accumulate.  This sweeper actually made vacuuming fun because you now know how clean the house is. This sweeper has useful attachments and an easy extender that reaches the ceiling and does a nice job on the base boards.  It's an easy sweeper you'll love having.
Great suction and light weight!  This is a great vacuum - terrific for furniture, tight spaces (inside cabinets, etc.), draperies and blinds - great suction and light weight - tools store inside - easy to clean out cannister - good price, shipped very fast - nice find!
excellent product
Eureka 4870GZ Boss Smart-Vac Upright Vacuum  Great product. Works on my thick carpet and tile floors equally well.  The paw does an outstanding job of picking up dog hair.  Recommend it highly.
So happy with this cleaner  I just used this machine today and am really happy with the results.  I used the tile and grout cleaner as all my floors are made of this.  The grout is a very light color and it had gotten very dirty and dark.  The machine is very user friendly.  The tanks are easy to remove and either fill or empty, whichever you need to do. I have a cleaning lady, however, she has been using a Swiffer Wet Jet for the last 4 years and my floors have looked worse and worse.  I am 65 y/o, have COPD and use supplemental oxygen but I was able to clean them myself by doing small sections at a time.  Although there is not much water left on the floor using the wash setting, the dry setting gets so much of the rest that it was completely dry in a minute or two.  The cleaner itself is very mild smelling and didn't bother my breathing at all.  The price was very reasonable considering how little you have to use per tankful.
Hard to beat for the price  Have had this vacuum over 2 years now. It has held up well & continues to work effectively. Great vacuum, especially for the price.
Very Nice  I received this refurbished vacuum like new in its original box just a few days after ordering, Thanks Amazon.  It seems to work quite well and I am pleased enough with its performance, considerations taken.  Just a couple quirks mentioned in other reviews I though I might clear up.  1) The handle release works a bit different than most. You must push down AND OUT for it to release, and it does require some effort. Once you get used to it it is tolerable.  2) The brush roll switch works quite hard and requires alot of effort to engage however it will not break. Just keep pushing until you hear it click.  3) Make sure the front of the sweeper is lifted off the floor before using the carpet height adjuster.  Now for a few of my own con's:  1) It doesn't seem to vacuum bare floors as well as my Hoover and must be adjusted down very close to the floor.  2) On all floors the unit seems to have weaker suction on the left side, because the vacuum hose comes to the brush area on the right side.  3) When you tilt the front of the sweeper up it seems to lose suction power entirely. It needs to be close to the floor for the floor to seal the vacuum area. Again I beleive this is because the vacuum hose to the brush area is on the right side. And again my old Hoover didn't exhibit this behavior, perhaps from having the source of suction in the center.  4) The three above cons all seem to relate to keeping the front of the sweeper close to the floor surface you are sweeping. The sweeper is very dependant on using the "floor" as a the final part of the vacuum chamber so proper height adjustment and contact to the floor is critical for this sweeper. Why should a sweeper have vacuum when it's not on the floor? Well I am in the habit of lifting the front at the walls to "grab" those little mess' that are up the baseboard a little. My old Hoover grabs them right up. This vacuum doesn't even seem like it is turned on. Also at the transistion of carpet to hard floor there is that ridge at the edge of the carpet that gathers dirt. My Hoover would pick up all but the most stubborn (adhered) dirt there in any direction. This sweeper, as it rolls off the edge of the carpeting loses all suction and is useless here. You have to turn it around and approach these areas form the hard floor side. And then you must go to the hard floor routine with the height adjusted down very close to the floor for adeqaute suction.  5) The sweeper uses a wide brush roll belt which leaves a noticable streak, stripe or blank spot on your carpet to the left side. It seem to me it kind of narrows the "wide path" feature of this vacuum as I have to overlap the path on the next pass to "cover" this streak. And again my old Hoover used a narrower much less intrusive belt that I couldn't "see" in the carpet. And it never broke.  6) The extension hose assembly it difficult to figure out. I suppose time will help here.  7) As I started this review with, the brush roll switch and handle release are indeed to hard to operate.  8) The upolstery noozle does not store securely and has already fallen out of its holder a few times on me.  9) The bag is too small, probably less than half the size of my Hoover. Looks like frequent changes.  10) The HEPA filter discharge blows hair and other light debris "away" from the front of the sweeper before it has a chance to reach the vacuum chamber. There are times you have to "chase" these this type of debris.  Now for the pro's:  1) When the height adjuster is properly adjusted the sweeper does seem to brush my carpet much more vigorously than my Hoover. It does pick up more hair and other hard to pickup items on the carpet. This I think is this sweepers strongest attribute as I don't think the suction is any stonger, if as strong, than my Hoover. I would say that overall it does do a better job of cleaning. It does do a nice job of "grooming" (note con #5).  2) The floor/hose control and the power/on/off switch right up top where they are easy to reach.  3) You can use the hose without the sweeper having to be locked in the upright posisition.  4) You can "meter" the floor/hose control to reduce suction to either the floor or hose.  5) The hose is always attached in place and ready to vacuum, all you need to do is turn the floor/hose vacuum knob. I had to insert this hose into my Hoover.  6) HEPA filter my Hoover didn't have.  7) You can turn the brush off for delicate floors, my Hoover didn't have that option.  One thing I have found in looking at many, if not all, vacuum sweepers is that none are even close to adquate. All having many more con's than pro's, and yes including the likes of Dyson. All you can do is choose one that has the pro's most important to you and con's you can live with. I am really puzzled as to why in todays high tech world no one makes a much more user friendly vacuum. I understand trade-offs, comprimise and such but none of the user design flaws I have seen in vacuum sweepers are necessary. Just some common sense from the designer/s should have averted the vast majority of them. These people need to bring that engineering mind home with them and clean house!  To close, maybe the #1 pro of this sweeper is it's price which has to be considered. And to me at this price I consider this sweeper is a very good performing product that I can live with until someone comes up with that now absent user friendly sweeper.
Very happy with this product.  Works as expected.
Best vaccum i have ever owned
great cleaner  i was really surprised at this vacum.i figured for the price i would stick it in the garage for cleaning out the cars. but i stuck my other one out there and kept the cyclone for inside.
Best vacuum ever!  I love this vacuum!!  It works great going from hard wood to rugs to carpet. Best one I've ever had
Truly excellent  WOW just unpacked it and gave it a spin on my wood floor: amazing amount of dirt and pet hair came up into dirty water tank. The floor was swept and mopped one day before! Ran it into the bathroom and it cleaned beautifully. Even my stone floored kitchen with deep grout lines came much cleaner. I'm sold on this thing.
I love it  This is one of the best Hoovers Ive ever had. I have always bought Hoover vacumes and steam cleaners. It has 2 motor cycles like a Dyson. I was surprised that I found this as they haven't been in stores for a couple years. From what I read this is the last of its kind lol. It's all low quality now even Hoover it seems. Just like every thing else now adays.
A Godsend  This lovely appliance has been a godsend to me.  I hate mopping floors.  HATE.  But I also tend to make a mess in the kitchen.  This cleaner is about the size and shape of a good vacuum, and it isn't much more trouble than a vacuum either.  You do have to fill it with water and empty out the dirty chamber, but no more time spent bent over scrubbing floors.  It's bliss.  I've found that it cleans pretty well.  It doesn't always do so well in the areas under the counters and cupboards (why is there always that inch or so of space?), but most of the floor looks great, and it's much easier to clean.  I'm delighted.
Works great have used it many times now so far no complaints  I recommend it for sure great price to.. Easy to assemble, no missing parts, works on my tile floor also, easy to clean as well and I would DEFENITLY buy it again
AMAZING VACUUM  I LOVE THIS VACUUM!!!! iT HELPS WITH ALLERGIES, IT GETS UP CLOSE AND IN CORNERS. EASY TO CLEAN OUT. PLUS TWO FILTERS!!!! IT EVEN WORKS GREAT ON BARE FLOORS!!
Fantastic  My wife didn't think it would be worht the money, got it on sale during the holidays! She vacummed the whole house with the old vac, then redid it with the new Dyson. She could belive how much dirt it picked up, by time she was done she had to emapty th canister. She was very impressed, great value!
The most amazing vacuum ever!  My friend and I both bought one of these because we both have pets and lots of pet hair. As soon as we received them and used them for the first time we were on the phone with each other raving about these vacuums. I have cats and allergies so I've always vacuumed frequently, and kept my carpet what I thought to be pretty clean. Even so, I had to empty the Dyson canister 5 times the first time I used it because it picked up so much hair that my other vacuum had left behind. Amazing!! It is also VERY easy to use. I love it! Thank you Dyson!!
5* vac!!!  The ease of this vac is worth the price. No bags, pulls up stuff off the hard floor as well. I'm amazed at the stuff it pulls up that I had no idea that was on the floor.
Best vacuum cleaner I've ever used  A bit of background first. In the last 30 years, I've had three vacuum cleaners: two top-of-the line Hoovers, and a Kenmore; all uprights. The Hoover Concept One lasted maybe 12 years. My uncle first recommended the Miele to me a couple of years ago. I read about it; it seemed like an impressive machine, but my Hoover was still serviceable and I'm pretty cheap. Anyway, last month the motor housing of the Hoover somehow got knocked askew so that the vacuum leaned to one side. Ok - time to reconsider the Miele. I developed asthma a few years back, so I opted for the Jazz because it had the HEPA filter. All I can say it that I don't drive a German luxury car, but this Miele is built for high performance like a BMW and just as solidly. Apart from the excellent filtration system, the adjustable suction control and auto height adjustment are nice features. I've never been a fan of headlights since I never found them all that useful and the bulbs are a pain to replace, but this Miele has a row of LED lights and they are actually quite useful when using the wand attachment to clean under furniture with low clearance. The extendable wand is very nice - it easily allows me to reach up to the ceiling to suck up those occasional cobwebs. As for drawbacks, there's only two: (1) this unit is noticeably heavier than my old Hoover, which makes it a bit of a chore to haul up and down stairs, (2) the replacement HEPA filter costs $50.00! The first drawback is somewhat offset by the swivel neck design, which really helps maneuverability. I guess I can justify the cost of the filters because of my asthma. The Miele website has some interesting articles describing comparing particulate emissions from different brands of vacuums. I've seen generic HEPA filters for Miele at about half the cost of the genuine filters, but in the end I figure I've only got one set of lungs so why skimp.
Love this little but powerful vacuum, so glad we chose it!
Excellent value.  It took less than five minutes to assemble.  I love the extension wand for cleaning the ceiling fan.
love it!  I have hard wood floor and a large dog.  dirt happens, a lot.  it's so simple and it leaves the floors looking great.
Still loving it..after 3 years!!  A friend owned  the model previous to this and highly recommended this brand; after much searching and reading reviews etc, we eventually settled for this  model.  Previously, we owned a Kenmore upright. I spent a fortune on replacing the belts which would melt and burn at any given time. The suction on the Kenmore sucked(hahha). etc etec.  It has been more than three years since we made our purchase. With a household of seven, we use it 1-2 times a day, sometimes more than 3 times depending on what mess took place! My children suffer from pretty nasty allergies, and I have found this vacuum to pick ups extremely well, providing a clean and safe area at all times. After 3 yrs, the suction is still great..  Belts.. still using the original belt that came with the vacuum, and it is still in excellent condition.  Hand tools, attachments..still excellent condition, no cracks,or brittle as mentioned by others  Headlight..still working  The Paw..does a great job with the upholstery and curtains/blinds  Bags.. never liked bagless, very happy with the bags. Don't  know where the complainers live, but we can find the bags easily at Walmart, Sears and Target. You can vacuum for weeks  and they will not be filled.  Price..this was  a factor for us. We wanted something that was affordable and could not justify spending over $200-300.  Weight..ermm, it is heavy, BUT not heavy as I expected it to be after reading some of the negative points. My children vacuum all the time, so if my  8,9,10 yr old's can handle it with ease, I think an adult can too!! We do have a single story, so it may be easier for others to invest in a 2nd vacuum ..  It may not be 100% perfect (tell me what is), but this is a purchase we are extremely satisfied with. BTW, I don't go for the CR reviews, instead rely on  reviews by customers like you ..
just what i expected thank you
The #1 brand I recommend  One of the best vacuum cleaners that I have every owned.  The suction is absolutely incredible and I can tell my carpets are much cleaner after vacuuming.
Works great, consumer reports rating high and it is correct in their rating.  Quiet and picks up golden retriever hair well.  Works great, consumer reports rating high and it is correct in their rating.  Quiet and picks up golden retriever hair well.
Love this. This is my second one  Love this.  This is my second one.  Works really well on floors.  I don't have rugs so I can't tell you about that.  Comes with two batteries which is a bonus.  I always have one charged.  I have a two bed room home and can vac my whole place with one battery.
Sucks you in  works well, cleans well. The housekeeper is the one to use it. Still very noisy on high suction.
Love this vacuum!  Best vacuum I have ever had, the tools are easy to use, the suction is great, easy to empty dust bin.  Quite heavy, but easy to steer, power helps move the vacuum along even the thickest carpet  in our home.  Awesome vacuum!
a "Must Have" cleaning tool.
It works  Small and relatively quiet. The "bag" & filter fill quickly so it seems to be picking up a lot of dust & dog hair. Odd that it blows air out near the floor but that's generally not a problem.
A MUST have  I have never written a review before but I had to sit down this time and write one.  I have two little kids (2.5 years and 6 months old) plus 3 cats and fully carpeted house. I vacuum every day on top of it I have a roomba vacuuming all the time (once it's recharged I turn it on again) then we also don't wear the shoes at home and I steam clean the carpets every month.  I'm a cleaning freak.  I turned this vacuum and I realized how dirty my carpets are. I kept hearing all of those dirty particles from my carpets being sucked into the canister.  The little noise was present at each area for good 5 minutes.  The vacuum kind of shakes the carpet allowing all of the particles to be sucked in.  Amazing.  My carpets (we moved to a house that already had 20 years old carpets) look so fluffy now.  You can see foot prints when you walk on the carpets.  Crazy! A must have vacuum.  If you buy it from Costco you get the guaranty that if the vacuum breaks you can just return it so don't worry about the negative reviews posted on Amazon.  This vacuum is worth every penny!
It's the GD Rolls-Royce of vacuum cleaners, is what it is!  works better and quieter than any vacuum I've ever seen.  highly recommend.  will be hard to ever go back to normal upright vacuums.  I was used to Hoover windtunnels and sharks.  just as impressive as the suction and cleaning is the sound (quietness).
My wife and I love this Vacuum Cleaner! she says our house has never been this clean!
Great
Finally  Finally, a canister that does what I want it to do. I am so thrilled and we are currently already saving money for the next one we will buy in a couple of years, we will upgrade to the next higher model. But this is a great item. Very flexible, good suction, no smell, no mess to clean up (unlike bagless ones), I highly recommend this
Best Vacuum ever, especially if you have leg or back problems.
Best vacuum I ever owned!  I was a little worried about ordering this vac without seeing it work or buying it locally but....I have to say that it is amazing!!!! Does a great job!  I have used Dyson vac's but couldn't afford one myself..let me tell you..this vacuum works as good or better at 1/3 the cost!!!!
no bells and whistles and it's loud but this is my favorite vacuum cleaner ever.  the kids fight over this vacuum cleaner-the loser gets the Dyson...  very strong suction, no moving parts in the head to get clogged with hair. my two complaints are the short power cord and the loudness - neither would keep me from HIGHLY recommending this vacuum!
A very good vacuum  A very good vacuum. I'm happy with my purchase.
This vacuum rocks..
Life-transforming!  I never thought I would be tempted to wax lyrical about a household appliance, but this vacuum cleaner lives up to the hype 100%.  I have velvet sofas that were embedded with dog hair.  nothing could get the hair off them or out of the corners of my apartment.  one going over with the stair attachment and my furniture is hair and dust free!  the suction on this baby is so stong, it also removed dust from mouldings along the walls.  Again using the stairs attachement, i was able to vaccum my mattress and the top of 2 armoires instead of swiffering while standing on a step ladder.  the design is incredibly user-friendly.  i am not a particularly strong person and find the Dyson easy to move around and lift.  the hose is built into the upright, so there is no awkward attaching and detaching of parts -- just press a button and the hose pulls off the main unit, and telescopes several feet out.  other plusses are that the electrical cord is quite long and the canister is a breeze to empty.  just make sure that anything you don't want vacuumed up is off the floor -- this vacuum tried to swallow a metal curtain rod that was lying beneath my computer cart!  If you have pets or dust prblems, this vaccum cleaner will change your life. I looooove my Dyson!
Great item!  I haven't used a canister vacuum cleaner since I left my parents' house - my mom was a big fan of them. When I needed a new vacuum cleaner, I was researching for a long time. I made a few trips to a local store for advice and to see items in real life. But when it was time to buy, amazon gave me the best price.  So far, I am very happy with it and no regrets or complains. It does carpets and hardwoods, and it was important to me. The suction is very good, and it's really quiet - you can talk on the phone while vacuuming :-)  I also had a pleasure to talk to Electrolux customer service (telescopic wand was slightly bended when I opened the box). With no problems they sent me a new one.
Love it'  I bought this to clean a large area in my house that consists of tile floors. It does a great job with cleaning and sucking up the excess water. The drying feature is great. My floors dry so much quicker than mopping.
Finally!  With 2 dogs in the house & 1 that sheds pillows full of fur,this vaccum does what it says!  My Sears vacuum that I thought was great,wouldn't pick up a single hair!
Oreck Super Deluxer  Excellent canister vacuum, very powerful.  Great for doing my stairs with rugs.  The attachments are great for cleaning drapes, couch and my fans.
Great vacuum and wonderful seller!!  Thank you  I ordered this unit to replace one that was over 20 years old.  This unit has so much more power and is so quiet.  It arrived quickly and was very easy to install.  I am really glad we decided to go with this unit.  It not only saved us money it is a much better vacuum.
Great on my new plush carpet  Just got it yesterday for my new Mohawk plush carpet and it works great! So easy to push and very light. My old Shark wouldn't move on the carpet and this Oreck does the job.
Removes pet hair like nothing else  This vacuum cleaned the pet hair in our house so easily, both from floors and furniture.  The Pet Turbo Brush is great, worked on a sofa that even a lint roller wasn't keeping clean at all.  The suction is so good that it cleans deep down and it will pick up dirt like no one has ever vacuumed your floors before!  Dirt cup is easy to empty, and my only complaint/suggestion is that on the part where you wind the cord, they could have made that a bit further apart because there's a lot of cord to wind on the two close-together little hooks.
love it
Gifted  She loves it
The Best  This is my second one.  Older one "promoted" to downstairs.  This Hoover model can't be beat, especially because of the attachments "on board" and the ease in operation.  Bags are easy to replace and the Hippa bag a plus.
Loved it so much, Bought a second for my Mom  Works great on both Carpet and Floors, swithces over easy, cleans well.  The Best part is it is lightweight and easy to get into smaller spots.
FANTASTIC suction!  FANTASTIC suction!! Not too heavy or hard to maneuver.  Only negative is how you empty, have to be careful not to get all over when bottom drops.  Love it!!
Awesome floor cleaner  I bought a house with about 1900 sq ft of laminate flooring. I have to find something that would make cleaning them easier. I have definitely found the best machine for the job. I have two English Bulldogs that she's like crazy. It gets up their hair and makes my floors squeaky clean. If this machine breaks I will move or buy another one. This thing is awesome!!
I love this floor scrubber.  My husband just bought me this floor scrubber a few weeks ago and I love it!!  As any reviewers mentioned you do have so make sure the handle is fully seated into the machine. I thought mine was, and I was enjoying using the machine when suddenly the sprayer stopped working and the power would cut off intermittently. I was about to return the unit when my husband noticed that the handle had backed out. He fixed the problem and it has worked perfectly since then. I love that I can use any cleaning solution I want. I buy big containers of stone cleaner/sealer and clean my travertine with it.  I can't believe how much dirt is coming off the floor. It is the only unit I saw (especially in this price range) that has separate containers for clean and dirty solution, and that dries the floors. The stone cleaner tends to leave streaks on the floors when left to air dry so I have never been able to clean it with a traditional mop. I have been cleaning and drying the floor while crawling around on my hands and knees. No more!  I can clean the floor and dry it to a streak free shine!  This is the best!
Nice vacuum  It works really good.  I have an 75 pound dog that sheds everywhere and 5 kids in my home, my floors are always a mess and this works so well.
Best Vacuum Cleaner!  We love our Cinetic Big Ball Animal. It's the best vacuum cleaner that we have ever owned.
easy to use works  worth the money. easy to use works great
Small in size but POWERFUL!!  Another great product from Oreck! Works great for small crevice areas where my Oreck Pilot cannot go! Windows, under the kitchen counters and in tight corners. Excellent Machine!
Dynamite Little Vac!!  I bought this for my mother and it's great.  She lives in a 950 sq.ft. apartment which is carpeted except for kitchen and baths.  Her carpet is low pile and this vac does a great job on it.  Some of the reviews say it's not good on carpet but it has such a strong suction that it is more than adequate for low pile.  Be sure not to let your drapes too close to it -- it's that strong.  I wonder if the folks who complained about the suction know to use the suction control.?.  Anyway, for $58 and free shipping, it's the best deal out there.  PLUS, Amazon got it to me within two days of purchase.  I recommend this little workhorse.
They say it's the best sweeper they've ever had  Christmas gift for daughter & son-in-law. They say it's the best sweeper they've ever had. Will buy one for myself next time I need a new one!
Goodbye Hoover & Dyson, HELLO Shark!!  I am a floor care person to an OCD-ish degree.  I have all wood floors upstairs and down with area rugs. I keep my rugs well vacuumed with a Hoover (upstairs) and a Dyson (downstairs) and I shampoo the rugs regularly.  They always look very clean. When I unpacked my Shark Slim-Lite, I tried it out on the 1st floor rugs and was blown away.  Because I had just put it together, I didn't notice that it was set on "turbo" suction and the brush bar was not on.  Unbelievable what came out of my area rugs.  I had to empty the canister 3 times.  Then when I turned on the brush bar, I had to empty it a 4th time!  There were big wads of dust, but it also pulled out very fine dirt with a texture like powder.  I could not believe the filth that came out of those rugs and here I thought I was Mrs. Clean!  I haven't tried the wood floor attachment yet but can't wait.  This vacuum cost half of what I paid for my Dyson and has far more suction. Love it, Love it, Love it.
Hoover S3670 WindTunnel bagged canister vacuum  Very happy with this purchase so far. Easy to manuever, light weight. Good handle design.
Very good product. Thanks  I also havea Dyson  I now prefer my Shark.  Very good product.  Thanks Shark
Best I have seen for dog hair  I have a yellow lab and the hair gets everywhere....especially when "shedding her winter coat."  I would say the Dyson is the best vacume I have ever seen work.  My mother also owns a cleaning company in NH, so, I have seen her go through many vacumes (ones that cost over $1000).  I also purchased a refurbished one and even though it had a few scratches and dings on it, it worked perfectly.
Creat vac.- Great service !!  I ordered this Sanyo vac. and it is GREAT!!! And Amazon is great on shipping had it in 2 days. All web sites need to see how Amazon does business on the Web.. The free shipping was really great and the prices are on the money. VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER # 10 in my book...
Awesome Vacuum for All Floor Types  When I bought this vacuum I was looking at a Hoover that according to consumer reports is rated one higher than this one but at twice the price.  I have all hardwood floors on the main level and all carpet for the downstairs and I wanted a vacuum that would be able to do both plus the stairs but not being to heavy to carry up and down.  This vacuum has it all easy to switch between the carpet and hardwood a nice feature is that the brush turns off automatically when you switch it so that you do not scratch the floors.  The power of the suction is more than enough to pick up anything.  There is little to no effort when using it also there is no need to get a direct drive vacuum it is not very hard to most glides on the floor and carpet.  This is finally a vacuum where you can watch the game and some can be using it very quite.  Overall I have suggested this vacuum to my friends and family.
Worth the price  Needed something for tile floors that worked. Read all reviews and decided to take a chance. Wife just loves it. Lightweight and mobile. great choice.
Great buy !  I bought my Dyson DC 40 Animal vacuum yesterday on Black Friday at Costco. I got a great deal, only $367.00 less another 3% rebate for being a Costco member. Easy assembly. This is my 2nd Dyson. I bought my first Dyson about 5 yrs ago, still works fine. My new Dyson is light, easy to carry, easy to push, glides great and maneuvers nicely around furniture. It works great on stairs, drapes and furniture. Picks up pet hair, dust and dirt great. Simply push a button to switch from carpet to hard-floor surfaces. Also easy to empty and easy to clean. I'm very happy with this vacuum.
The BEST of the best! : )  A great vacuum stick at any price!
Great for pet hair and all the filters are reusable
Excellent Experience !  Excellent Product and outstanding experience with this supplier
"Pet Proofer"  Among my three dogs, I have a German Shepherd who enjoys leaving fur balls throughout the house, even after a solid brushing.  This vacuum's pet proofing power helps him be his old natural self, indeed without any tinge of guilt.
5 star vacuum, tackles pet hair from upholstery to carpet!  Super easy to assemble, using all of the tools is made super easy by being able to remove from the base and walk around with it! Lightweight, snaps right back into place to go from upholstery to carpets. As a pet owner with allergies, this is a life saver. Removes hair, dust, and dirt that other vacuumes leave behind. Makes vacuuming a pleasure not a hassle! Worth every penny.
I love it.  Five stars: 1.  Very prompt delivery and very easy to set up. 2.  Cleaned my carpets and hardwood floors both very well. 3.  Self propelled is a gift to the elderly like me who have to do our own household chores. 4.  Very reasonably priced. 5.  I like the convenience of the bags and being able to buy refills on line.
Exceeded my expectations  Product arrived on time and everything was in excellent, brand-new condition as described by the seller. Came with more accessories than expected. Works better than any other vacuum I have ever had besides my last Rainbow tank vacuum that was almost 20 years old when it finally died. My only complaint is that now I have absolutely no excuse not to get the vacuuming done. ;-)
BEST CANISTER VAC SINCE THE EUREKA PRINCESS!
Really like this vacuum  Really like this vacuum!!!!
dyson DC24 ball review  I received the product promptly, put it together and I think it is fabulous so far!  I couldn't believe how much dirt it pulled out of my carpets.  Obviously my last vacuum cleaner didn't do the job.
an awesome product. Heavy duty  No doubt, an awesome product. Heavy duty. Works wonderfully. Love it. Worth every penny.  That said, I wish they had put the main power button up on the handle, and also concealed or covered in the cord retract button, as both of these get activated when you are using the unit, that is, when you are holding the main unit while vacuuming. But, not a big deal.  By the way, I came to the Miele product after reading a very good AMA on Reddit via guy that repairs and sells new and used vacuums. He made some very good points about the Dyson and other models, and rated Miele as one of the best. I can see why. I can also understand, after owning a few other types of bag-less designs, why he said that a bag based unit was better. In this case, no doubt, because even as the bag fills, the vacuum force is still really good.  Additionally, I don't have any pets. I just choose this unit because it came with the added filtration, which I think is a good idea for all applications.  Highly recommend this unit. Money well spent.
Good Choice!  I hate vacuuming.  Period.  I decided to switch from a canister to an upright, hoping that it would encourage me to vacuum more frequently.  Well, it worked. No more assembling pieces and bending over the canister.  This is an easy vacuum to use.  Even has a light to tell you that the area is clean (great for me as I find it hard to tell when its clean). And an window to check when the bag is full.  Simple, lots of attachments.  GREAT SUCTION!  That was important to me because of cat hair.  Does a great job! It's a quality product!  GO HOOVER!
Highly recommended for small cleanup jobs  This is a great little vacuum.  I have two cats and I keep the litter box in my bathroom, but the tracked litter demands almost daily vacuuming--I tried a broom and dustpan and it just doesn't quite do the trick.  Rather than break out the big vacuum that I use for the carpeting, I keep this little vac plugged in an out of the way corner so that it stays charged.  It picks up the litter perfectly and has solved my problem of icky tracked litter sticking to my damp feet when I get out of the shower.  The carpet brush is probably not strictly necessary for me but I've found myself using it for little pick-ups of debris on the carpet as well and it works really well. The suction on this little vacuum is really powerful!  I used to have a Euro-pro Shark but I hated it--the suction was terrible, it was horribly noisy, and half the time I would vacuum stuff up and it would fall right back out of the dust cup as soon as I turned the vacuum off!  This Eureka is just great in comparison.
Unique design will save you money from common clogs that destroy vacuums!!!  -Amazing vacuum cleaner for the money....a shopper can not go wrong-  The unit has a very large dust collector container, clear brush design window that allows you to immediately see clogs that can destroy a machine (had this happen to my other two vacuums that resulted in blown out the motors due to an unseen clog), and super long cord that can get an entire apartment clean in one pass.  Seriously awesome model and a steal at under $100!
Amazing!  Absolutely Amazing. Thought my carpet was clean and it picked up LOTS more dirt and dog hair. I would recommend it highly!
Great! A little bit noisy tho.
Shark Navigator Lift Away Upright  This is one terrific vacuum cleaner.  I sold vacuum cleaners for many years of various brands ect. and none have cleaned the way this unit does.  Very lightweight and gets around in the tightest places.  I like the long cord and the on board tools.  The powered pet brush works like a charm on furniture.  The most interesting point I find is the ability to use the powered pet brush and the lift away feature to clean my staircase and I find this to be easy and what a great job the unit does.  One other thing I don't seen mentioned in other reviews is the wonder job the rotating brush and suction do to lift the nap of the carpet.  I find that the carpet stays looking better much longer.  I would highly recommend this product and really don't have any cons to write about.  Buy it. You will like it!!
Quiet & Lightweight but powerful  The vacuum is quiet and really lightweight, super easy to tote from floor to floor.  It's a bit of an adjustment to not have tools onboard the upright but using the canister (and on board attachments) is super easy too!  Vacuum bags are hard to find - I ended up ordering a case of them (Hoover Type Q) from Amazon after searching in person at Home Depot, Lowes and Walmart and couldn't find them.  They were available to order online elsewhere but not with the quick & free shipping of prime so consider getting the bags when you purchase the vacuum too
I love this vacuum!  I live in a 1-bedroom 900 sq ft townhouse with one cat and no carpeting. This is a perfect vacuum. I love that it is lightweight, easy to maneuver, and doesn't require bags. The design and look of the vacuum is lovely. I've never had so much fun vacuuming!
NICE VACUUM  EL7020A is the highest rated canister by Consumer Reports in 2006 - this is why I chose it.  I had this vacuum for almost a month now, and I really like its performance.  I like that the wand with the power brush fits under the bed where my upright did not fit.  I like that this vacuum has HEPA filtration and I do not sneeze when vacuuming anymore.  The vacuum has powerful suction and nice features like "auto power-brush off when something gets stuck in it" and "auto suction reduction when something stops the airflow, so you can pull it out".  E.g., if a corner of a bathroom rug gets sucked in, the vacuum reduces suction power and you can pull the rug out, and the suction increases automatically.  The bags are very small (mine filled up with carpet fibers after vacuuming the house 2 times).  I did not mind, all that means is that I don't keep all that dirt inside my vacuum in my home and throw it away more often.  Like one other user said, the "change bag" light did not come on when the bag filled up.  I found that the bag was full thanks to my curiosity.  I suspect that the "change bag" light performance depends on what the bag fills up with - if it fills up with carpet fibers, which still allow sufficient airflow, the light won't come on.  Another interesting thing I found was that the box says "Model EL7020A", but the bottom of the canister has a sticker that says "Model 7001".  I contacted Electrolux about the discrepancy, and, according to their Customer Service Rep, the model EL7020A is a combination of the 7001 canister and a power carpet brush (plus a bunch of other add-on tools).
love, love  love, love, love this. picks up hair like a dream. the hand held part need the part on the end to work correctly due to side holes.
Really picks up the pet hair and fine dust  I love the convience of no bags and easy wash up.  It really picks up the hair and fine MT dirt from tile and carpet.
Great product for price  Easy to assemble and use.  Picks up dirt on hard wood floor and carpet nicely.
Very good vacuum  Light weight, efficient.  Big improvement over older vacuums
LOVE IT!!  I just love this machine and how it cleans my floors.  If you are thinking about it, get it!!  It blows away anything else I have used.
Great product
I bought this for my 86 year old dad and he absolutely loves it. He has wall to wall carpeting and the vacuum is very powerful in picking everything up.
Fantastic Vacuum  Purchased this vacuum to replace my older hoover wind tunnel bag vacuum. Couldn't be happier with the bagless feature. The cord coil system is amazing. I'd recommend this to a friend any day!
This thing sucks!  Well, it sucks, and it sucks very well. This is a no-thrill sucking vacuum cleaner. I've had others that were more fancy and more expensive, but none sucked as well as this one. I'm not sure why others have problems with this vacuum, but after almost a year of usage, mine still sucks as well as when it came home the first time. The power cord is long, which is good for a small apartment. Plug it into a centrally located power outlet and you can vacuum the whole place. The extensions are great, too. The brush head is great for cleaning dust from a computer. All in all, this is one sucking machine. And I'll buy it again if mine bites the dust one day.  P.S. I bought an extra belt, just in case. So far, haven't had to replace the belt yet.
This is THE best vacuum I have ever owned  This is THE best vacuum I have ever owned. It is so easy. It sucks everything up no problem. It empties out with one push of a button and the cord winds up with just a push of a button. Im so impressed that I vacuum everything. I love it!!!
Super vacuum, Has suction you wouldn't believe.
It TRULY works as good as it says  We have 3 cats, and 3 dogs. This vacuum is everything as described. It TRULY works as good as it says. I love it!!
I love this vacuum!  I bought this vacuum when my Bissell was in the shop for the second time in three months! I chose this over the Hoover EmPower, which is recommended by Consumer Reports. (When I saw the EmPower though, I didn't like that the Hepa filter is in the dirt cup, and the plastic body felt cheap. It's also a pain to remove the hose to use attachments!)  PROS:  *Pretty easy to push, even when on a low carpet setting.  *It holds a lot of dirt and fur.  *It has a lifetime Hepa filter.  *There is a primary filter, which prolongs the life of the Hepa filter.  *The cord is on a ratchet, so you don't have to wrap it around and around every time you use it!  *There is an easy release mechanism on the dirt cup so you can empty it without getting your hands dirty. However, it's still easy to take apart if you want to clean it out thoroughly.  *When you start your vacuuming with a clean dirt cup, you can see proof that you are really accomplishing something!  *The attachments are very easy to use, and transitioning from floor to attachments is simple.  CONS (What do you expect for under $100?):  *The cord isn't all that long, so I do have to use three outlets to get three areas of my house. (But just how much would fit on a ratchet reel? Winding a long cord manually is more time consuming than moving the plug to another outlet!)  *The primary filter, which looks like a small Hepa filter, needs to be banged on a rock or something to remove fine dust. (In Arizona, that's a lot!) It doesn't say it's washable, but I hosed it off one day and made it white again with no visible damage!  *The only extension wand is also the crevice tool; I'd prefer to have a large bore tube extension in addition to the crevice tool.  *The crevice tool likes to fall off sometimes while I'm vacuuming.  *As with ALL bagless vacuums, the dirt cup should be emptied in an outside garbage can because dirt WILL fly around to some degree. If that's not convenient for you, you should probably stick with bagged vacuums.  *I tried it on a bare floor near the cats' litter box, and just got my ankles sand blasted. Better to use attachments on bare floor, since the beater brush can't be disabled.  So now I have a Bissell CleanView Deluxe and a Hoover Elite Rewind. Despite minor drawbacks, I find the Hoover so convenient to use that I've been vacuuming daily since I got it! This makes my home cleaner - and even fresher smelling! This vacuum was very reasonably priced, and I really feel I got a great deal for the money.
Amazing product  I ordered this vacuum to replace a Dyson Animal that we bought 13 years ago. I couldn't ask for a better vacuum. The last one was well worth the money invested.  Three of the four people in my household have allergy issues. We have removed the carpet in our house for this reason. The suction of this animal/allergy vacuum is amazing. I haven't had to use it on the bare floors yet, but I am pleased with the rugs!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone!
Hoover Windtunnel MAX Bagged Upright - UH30600  This is a good vacuum and its not too loud.  The attachment hose is really long.  Bought this vacuum as a present for my mom so I wanted a lighter upright and she is able to use this one just fine.
Great vacuum to have but a little heavy which makes it a little hard on the shoulder.
The only thing I don't really like are the heads  This replaces a Miele White Pearl which is at the vacation house instead of the main house.  This one is easier to maneuver than the WP, which is quite the beast.  The only thing I don't really like are the heads.  I have both carpet and tile so often I have to change the heads to do what I need to do.  The WP had a dual head I liked better, but such is progress.  It does a decent job with pethair, you just have to turn it all the way up.  The WP and this one use the same G/N bags (I get the 3M version) so that also works well as I have lots of those.  Both are quiet, no need to wear earplugs for this guy!  And the dog approves.
I didn't realize how dirty my hardwood floor actually were lol
This Dyson did an amazing job. Money well spent  I didn't think anything would get the dog hair out of my rugs.  This Dyson did an amazing job.  Money well spent.
Thank you, Bissell and Santa.  Wowza!  Just got mine in the mail and it's all I wished for.  Easy to assemble, use, clean. I read the short, easy to follow pamphlet instructions and did not have any of the issues of the negative reviews. Have wanted something to make me love the decision to have these wood floors again and this does it.
works so great. love the cord winder feature. light weight.
love this machine
Dirt Devil Vision Bagless Canister Vacuum  MO82750  This was not the canister vacuum I had in mind when I ordered it.  I ended up returning the item,  However, I would highly recommend the seller.  The vacuum was in excellent condition, shipped very promptly, and the return was processed without any issues.  Would buy from this seller again.
Love it!!!  Absolutely perfect for my needs! Picks up all the little specks of "stuff" that fall in the kitchen and on my carpets. For a quick daily sweep over, this is an ideal 2 in 1 machine. Very light weight and so easy to use and clean out!  And no assembly required!!! Love it!!
Awesome!  My grandparents gave me this vacuum for Christmas. I just love it! It is compact and easily fits into our tiny apartment. The attachments are helpful for reaching into high and small places. Works great for wood floors!
Great vacuum for laminate floor  We purchased this vacuum after installing laminate flooring in two additional rooms in our house.  It works well and is easy to maneuver.
great machine
What a relief!  As a brit in a strange land I wanted a canister cleaner, rather than a bulky, heavy upright. They can be found in stores but only lightweight and not very powerful. But this one is great - love the powered head for carpet cleaning and easy to empty chamber. It works better than the upright I was borrowing previously, also made by hoover, and is easier to manipulate around the house.
Awesome!!!  Awesome vacuum!! The rugs looked new and were really soft afterwards. I have never had a vacuum that cleaned this well. Though refurbished looked brand new.
Light easy to use and clean  Wife loves it. Light easy to use and clean.
Finally a stick vacuum that works!  Impressed with this vacuum. Especially after being so disappointed with name brand cordless stick machines.  What a nice design. Light and easy to use. Gets into corners and under the beds/furniture. The cord is long enough for doing carpeted stairs. Couldn't believe the dirt and pet hair it picked up from just the bedrooms that had recently been cleaned using the old wind tunnel Hoover. I was going to buy the base model but once I saw that this model had a detachable canister I bought it instead - good choice. Also this model includes plenty of attachments although I've only used a few so far.
Quality  I did a lot of research. Most vacuums are made of mostly plastic.  This is a quality machine.  It is replacing an upright, which I don't like to use because it is so hard on my bad back.  This canister does it all with ease.  It has just a few scratches, but compared to buying new for over 500 dollars, it is an amazing value.  I would buy from this seller again!
We are very satisfied. I referred to Consumers Report when Looking for a new vac. It was highly recommended.
I am in love with this Vaccum!  This is the best vacuum I have ever had! I have 3 cats and it gets up cat fur like nothing I have ever seen! If you are shopping for a new vacuum and you have pets BUY this one!
Great buy  From the moment I plugged it in, I was impressed with this vacuum.  While I don't have pets, we live in a dry and dusty area.  Keeping a cream colored carpet clean is tough, but so much easier with the LG.  It has great suction and is so easy to maneuver, the two top boxes on my checklist
The best vacuum ever!!!
I have a German Shepherd /Chow Mix and this Shark is the best at picking up her hair  Unbelievable! This vacuum picked up so much more hair than my Hoover. I have a German Shepherd /Chow Mix and this Shark is the best at picking up her hair! It is amazing!
Perfect for my garden home. Lots of power. Top buy in Consumer Reports at a low price.
This is by far the best vacuum we have ever had.
I love this vaccum!! It does a great job getting all of the cat hair.
Im not really a vacuum guy but this gets the job done quickly
Great for Hardwood Floors  Light weight easy to take room to room  Only wish the cord was longer  and the on/off was on the hosehandle
quality vacuum that lasts and lasts  I was looking for a particular product in my purchase history and noticed this vacuum that I had purchase in 2010.  I had to come back and write that it is now 2016 and I *still* have the vacuum and accompanying canister vac.  I still use it in everyday life.  It still works as good as the day I bought it. So the longevity of the vacuum can definitely be spoken of here.  I bought this vacuum based on reviews from Consumer Reports and those reviews did not let me down.  I am still easily able to get bags for these vacuums.  I have had NO problems with this vacuum whatsoever.  I do not even think I have changed a belt on it.  It has never clogged.  The suction is still as good as it was the day I bought it.  I also bought this vacuum because I have dust mite allergies and most vacuums make me sick because they blow back dust particles as you vacuum.  This one does not do that.  I love the HEPA bags and the way it closes the bag before you take it off.  Less to no dust for me to breath.  I loved this vacuum so much in the beginning that my boss bought one and my coworker bought one.  So if you are considering buying this, know that it withstands the test of time.
Never thought it would be this good.  LOVE IT!!!
good product  good product.  easy on the back to use.  works well
At last!  This has to be the best purchase I have made in a long time.  Four years ago we pulled up carpets and installed a beautiful laminate wood floor, walnut with shades that go from almost  black to a light maple tone. And it is shiny. I have tried everything from Swiffer to a steamer, to a mop and bucket,  to scrubbing on hands and knees. I have purchased two other floor cleaners that promised no streaking or spotting.  Everything leaves streaks or spots, unless the cleaning is followed immediately by drying with a towel.  Too labor intensive! So I told myself I would try one more cleaner,  and if it didn't work, give myself up to living with spots and streaks.  The Hoover floor mate worked! No more spots or streaks! There is a learning curve when you first use it. And it is still work, but not nearly as much work as mopping and drying, or cleaning on hands and knees.  And the results are worth the time and money spent on this cleaner.
Dyson DC17 Animal  This vacuum cleaner is an engineering marvel. We just had our house vacuumed last Friday with our Hoover and 2 days later , I still was able to fill the  Dyson canister!! Well worth the money. I bought it at Kohl's who had it at $549 on sale and was able to take another 15% off when I used their charge card!
Great vacuum  Thank you Amazon for offering this vacuum. The shops don't carry this too much anymore and it's a good little machine for a lot of crevice cleaning and hardwood floors. Definitely not good for carpets but I know there are special attachments that can be bought that would be compatible with this. Thanks very much.
Light and powerful  I love this little vacuum.  I actually enjoy vacuuming with it!  It's very light and portable.  Best of all, it works spectacularly. This was worth every penny and the shipping fiasco that I went through (not Amazon's fault at all - in fact they shipped another product very quickly to replace the original vacuum that had been lost by FedEx).  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.
Incredible  I got a kitten a month ago after never being around cats my entire life. This bissel literally saved my sanity! I was sweeping my laundry room and kitchen at least once a day and the whole process just started taking forever. This vacuum has picked up everything in site (I also have a dog who sheds a ton), and it's so quick and easy to use. Very portable, exactly what I expected for the price.
Well engeneired for easy assembly works extremly well best money I've spent in a long time. Thank you Bissell ! Time saving....I have four dogs I was mopping all the time now I'm done I half the time with floors I know are clean. No more pushing dirty water around this vac picks up the dirty water.
Worth The Money??  I did all the research I could fathom before purchasing the Dyson. My second Kirby (Generation 3) had been working well; but I was getting tired of repairing it and dealing with it's major shortcoming - dust from the bags! I've owned several of the better competitors models, including some of the best from Hoover, Regina, and Eureka. Honestly, the best vacuum I had experienced PRIOR to my Dyson was the Electrolux Rainbow, however, the WIFE complained rigorously about having to add water and assemble for use. The next logical step - Dyson!  Having owned some pretty hefty (metal housing) machines, I was very reluctant to purchase this nearly all plastic, silly colored machine! But all in all, a vacuums purpose - SUCK! (In a good way) The DYSON DOES SUCK! I too was quite surprised, nearly embarrassed, at how much the dirt collected in the clear bin! Room after room, this thing picked up enough to have filled the Kirby bag TWICE or the Rainbow canister SEVERAL times! And this from a house FREQUENTLY vacuumed! Folks, bottom line, no other vacuum I've owned has matched this one, regardless of costs!  Some observations thus far:  *The DYSON is audibly quieter than most anything I've used. I DO notice a bit of a high pitched whine - nothing annoying - but present on my particular machine  *Want your carpets REALLY clean - vacuum at HALF-SPEED! Not the DYSON - you... Move the machine about half as fast as you normally would and let the suction & beater bar do what they do best!  *DON'T purchase the BALL version if you or the spouse suffer any wrist/hand ailments. The ability to twist can tire the wrist quickly and there isn't the option to disable this and use rollers instead of the ball.  *Allow the pets back in the house! This machine WILL pick up the hair your other machines wouldn't! You wouldn't know we have a 75lb Akita indoor dog by looking at our carpet!  *Don't waste your money on the expensive attachments! Honestly, the brush & wand are about all you'll ever use. The others just set in the closet for me!  *Empty the catch-cup outdoors. YES, this machine is easy to empty and for the most part without a mess. Trust me, some dirt WILL migrate to the outer plastic shell.  *The power cord is long enough to reach several rooms from a single plug (for me anyway)  *The lexan materials are tougher than you might think. They'll hold up to regular use - but I'd treat them with some caution.  *The inside of the clear bin and shroud can be cleaned with water. There aren't any electronics in either and they BOTH (especially the shroud assembly) get saturated with dust/dirt. I use the hose to clean BOTH!  *Read the instructions to get the most out of the machine. They aren't difficult nor too lengthy. Once familiar with the machine, operation is simple.  Summarizing, this machine is IT! Worth every penny thus far. If it can lasts the years to come - it takes its place second to NONE! Three months and counting!  Don
Excellent value for a great vaccum/
I'm in love with my vacuum cleaner!  This thing does pick up pet hair, pet dander and dirt.  Works beautifully.  We don't have kids (and we plan on keeping it that way), so the complaints about the vacuum cleaner not picking up bigger things (like pop corn and so forth) doesn't bother us at all.  Some of the reviewers said that if you have that type of dirt in the house, the vacuum will clog up and not function well.  I can't say anything about it cause other than the pet hair and pet dander (2 cats and one dog - so A LOT of it) our house doesn't really get messy. My only complaint is that the canister fills up relatively quickly (with all the fur around) and we have to empty it about two to three times in order to get the whole house vacuumed (it's a 3 bedrooms house, all carpeted except for the kitchen and bathrooms floors). I would definitely recommend it if you're looking for a potent, light weight, bag less vacuum cleaner.  The attachments are very useful, and this vacuum cleaner is also used to vacuum the interior of our cars and we're very happy with its performance.
Works great for my apartment
Fantastic  Works much better than the Dyson it replaced and for much, much less.
The vest vacuum I have ever had!  This is the best vacuum I have ever had. I LOVE it. Can't say enough about the power it has and how well it cleans my carpet. I have to raise it up several levels to be able to vacuum my tile floor. It has that much power and suction.  I even love my German Sheppard a little more and I didn't think that was possible.
I like it.
Easy to Use and Does the job  The Dirt Devil Tattoo Crimson Bagged Canister Vacuum has several excellent features. I prefer the bag type vacuums because it keeps the dust contained and not all over when I empty it. The light weight makes it easy to move around. The suction is excellent. The attachments are useful. I wouldn't use this vacuum for large open spaces because it's a bit smaller and requires elbow grease, but for tighter areas with lots of corners and furniture this is perfect. You can easily switch to vacuuming the couch and drapes and back to the wood floor and carpet. It's not a pain to haul around. It's also quite attractive and cute, remind me of a lady bug. We have had no problems and many successes with this vacuum. I would recommend it. I am also getting one for a friend who admired mine, and for a family member who likes it.
The Vacuum is great, but Customer Service even better!  I have been meaning to write a review on this for a long time as Hoover did something very good for me. I bought this during a black friday sale 2 or 3 years ago for half off cause I needed a vacuum and it was light and available. It was super powerful and light and perfect for doing the stairs in my 3 story townhome (don't ever do this folks its, 3 stories is just too much). It even embarassed my carpet by showing how much it needed to be stretched. But the hoover made quick work of those stairs and I was grateful.  Anyhow, I ended up moving to a new house with hardwood/laminate, and the hoover performed well there too. But my wife started using it and not emptying it for too long causing it to clog. So I had to hose out the container cause it was chocked full of dust. I left out to dry on my outdoor patio, and of course, forgot that I put it there and I knocked it off the steps onto the driveway causing the latch to break. I was very disappointed cause the thing was basically perfect still except that latch. So I called customer service to see if they could sell me a new one.  The guy told me that the latch didn't come separate, but get this, he sent me a WHOLE NEW CANISTER for free. It was MY fault that it broke and he knew that I knocked it over, but they sent the canister anyway. Fantastic Customer service to boot, with a great product too. Can't recommend enough
Excellent. Lightweight and powerful
Mop alternative  Purchased to primarily clean the kitchen floor. With 3 dogs I was looking for an easier solution to using a mop. This product exceeded my expectations. I did not purchase for the vacuum feature and have not used that option so I will not comment on that but, it does a great job scrubbing and the drying time is almost none. Just the feel of the floor under my feet was enough to see how well the scrubber worked. I am very satisfied. 11/19/2011.... Its been a year since i purchased this product and it is still in working order. Have had no issues at all. I still give it a 5 star.
I never write reviews, but this time....i just had to... As a designer, I have always hated the idea of specifying carpet due to my impression of them being just dust collectors, since you can never truly get all the dust out when vacuuming Well, this little guy changed my mind! Suction is more than amazing! I felt like i was in an infomercial seeing the before and after while i used it for the first time! No wonder they made it lighter: it has so much power that it truly takes some effort (still light, don't worry) to run it thru the carpet, it just has so much suction! So affordable, you will not regret buying it. Best vacuum I've ever seen, and i have seen demonstration of those over $1k heavy vacuums. They don't come close. And....so cute in purple :)
thanks  didn't know my floor was so dirty until I used this
This product makes sense ! I recently returned a bissell because not only did it brake in my hands on day 1 but the design made no sense. The power button placement on the bissell was akward and to empty it was a hassel. This vac is so easy to empty with a push of a button right over your garbage can and the cord rewind is nice as well. Also the container where the dirt is kept is fairly large so you can just keep going room to room and i do own a dog and it seemed to pick up his hair pretty well. I really like that its not too heavy and bulky as well only need one hand to get it downstairs! Good product !I was always a fan of hoover
Awesome! Serious suction! Wish it came with a few more attachments.
Mt. Washington Dweller  This is the best small vacuum I have ever used.  Prior to receiving this, I bought and returned two others for lack of power.  This one really SUCKS (in a good, vacuumey-way)!!!  The bagless feature is great because at the end of vacuuming you can clean the dirt-holder and HEPA filter with water and reduce the dust even further.  I have two dogs (one collie), and a cat, and this 12-volt vacuume really does a great job, especially for a canister--much easier to push than an upright.
Buy it at Sam's Club  We bought our Dyson at Sam's Club for $415.00--They sell it as the 'DC07 Full Kit Vacuum' and it comes with the floor tool and the Animal tool (which is Awesome).  So it is essentially the same thing as the Animal, but cheaper than anywhere else!  And as for those negative reviews about the Animal tool not working...are you people crazy?  They must have tweed covered furniture and there pets must live on them!  We have two very small children, and two very big, heavily shedding dogs--an Akita and a Lab-Retreiver mix.  The animal tool works like magic on our micro-suede couches and the floor tool does fantastic on our new wood laminate floors.  The carpets have never been cleaner and I no longer cringe when my 6 month old rolls around on the carpet because I know its clean!!  Don't listen to ANY of those bad reviews...those people must be crazy!
Works great!
very good,,  Typical Hoover, very good,,,
happy buyer  you'll never want a different one, its silent and powerful. easy to move around and picks up every single dog hair :)
easy to use and maneuver  Light weight, packaged well, easy to use and maneuver.....love it!
Very Pleased  So far this vacuum has been great. I purchased for my basement which is finished. I just got tired of the lugging the upright up and down the stairs. I recently purchased an african grey parrot, she has a big cage but still makes a mess with feathers and food. I must say this vacuum picks up everything and the nice attachments or you can use no attachments like I do a lot when I want to pick up millet from the bird around the furniture legs or off the end table, lots of suction which is adjustable by pushing button on handle, It also comes with a stair attachment, works very nice. Everything seems very high quality on this unit, retractable cord is great. You will be happy with this vacuum.
Love this vacuum  I love this vacuum. I have 2 dogs and 3 cats and I use this vacuum several times a day to get up tons of pet hair.
Totally satisfiled  We have had this cleaner for about three weeks and so far it has worked as expected.  It is a heavy machine so the self--propelled motor is a good idea, especially for someone used to a lighter machine or anyone with a thick carpet.  It cleans well and works as advertised. It is nice to have an adjustment for cleaning hard floors as well as carpet.  We have a pet and the ability to pick up pet hair is extremely important--so far so good.  Time will tell as to how well it works over the long haul.  At this time, I would recommend this machine to anyone needing a good vacuum cleaner.
Love this cvacuum..it is the 2nd one I have purchased..1st one lasted 13 years!!
Solid quality at great price  My fiance is a huge Consumer Reports fan and an economist, so when he saw that the Hoover Tempo Widepath scored in the top 10 next to top-ranked vacuums two and three times the cost (it is listed two scores below a $1300 vacuum) we ordered it on the spot and I haven't been disappointed.  Suction is fantastic, and the noise level, while nowhere near as quiet as my parents' German (and pricey) vacuum, isn't bad. The body is sturdy and the parts solid. As other reviewers have noted, there is no bare floor function that will stop the rollers from spinning. As I live in a one-bedroom condo with minimal tile, this hasn't been an issue. I use a Swiffer anyway. If you have a lot of bare floors that you are used to vacuuming, this one's not for you.  All in all, this vacuum delivers the bang for your buck.
Tile cleaner.  Cleans well and easily.
Hoover WindTunnel Air Steerable Upright Vacuum  I love this product. It is easier to handle than the standard vacuums I've used and it really picks up the dirt. I haven't had it long but so far it lives up to it's ads.
Work saver, shoulder saver  I absolutely love my Dyson DC25 Animal. I find myself vacuuming a lot more than I used to. It is so easy to use. I had shoulder surgery and it was difficult for me to push my old vacuum around. The Dyson DC25 is lightweight and easy to manuver. I wondered how long it would take me to adapt to the ball, but it all came so easy. It is a lot quieter than my old machine too. The only disappointment is the size of dirt collection bin. If I want to do a good job I have to empty it at least four times because all the dog hair gets stuck and stops spinning. When it gets really dirty from the dust and dirt I can rinse it out. Which makes for a clean machine. It was well worth the price I paid for it.
Love it!  Love it!  It's easy to empty, pick's up great!  I have 5 dogs in my house so, I needed a powerful vac for all the pet hair.  It is easy to push also light weight.  I'm really pleased with my purchase.
This thing sucks so hard it will lift up your carpet while you're using it. Still working like new after nearly a year of almost daily use
Bissell 16501 Pet Hair Eraser Deluxe Upright Bagless Vacuum  So far, it works amazingly well.
I LOVE this thing  I LOVE this thing! I actually stopped cleaning just to write this review.  The suction is fantastic and its so light and easy to maneuver.  I can't say enough good!!! I'd give it more stars if I could!
Great to clean under furniture and steps.  The product exceeded my expectations.
This is our second Miele - we had one when we lived in Europe. Love it. Small details make this a very convenient and well-designed product. It's pricey but well worth it.
so far so gr8  As both my wife & I are over 65 and have various medical problems, our regular vacuums had become a real chore to use. This little unit does a gr8 job! easy to use and I'd recommend it.
just what we needed
Quiet, Careful and Thorough  The machine is remarkably quiet. Attachments are safely tucked away, yet easily accessible. Once you affix the vacuum head to the side slot, this machine neatly stands up in a closet or the corner of a room. Three small, rubberized swivel wheels (with shock absorbers) help keep the vacuum moving along with little effort. The vacuum has a 3D bumper (to protect walls and furniture), a cord with a strong, quick rewind and a telescoping wand of sturdy stainless steel...  The main head has soft, stiff bristles that protect our tile and laminate flooring. The round brush attachment allows careful vacuuming of dust-attracting electronics (plastic is softer at the base of the bristles). The LED light enables you to see in dark spaces (simply turn the LED light "on"--it automatically fades "off" after about 31 seconds).  The Miele does a great job vacuuming our two shag area rugs. The suction is strong enough to pull up crumbs/bits of paper that have burrowed deep down into the weave.  This is an ideal vacuum for those who can especially benefit from the thorough dust filtration and sealed containment (such as allergy or asthma sufferers). With the filters in place, this vacuum traps 99.95% of particles as small as .01 microns. The 9-ply, puncture proof dust bag has a spring loaded, self-sealing collar and "Airflow guides" (special fleece attached to the interior of the bag that traps fine dust).  Note: AirClean Dustbag, HEPA filter and dust compartment filter are NOT washable and reusable...Also, though product origin is Germany, this is NOT dual voltage.
So far so good. Great machine!
The cleaning girls love it.
Perfect for those with dogs who shed  I bought this particular vacuum because my dog sheds EVERY DAY. I have a Blue Heeler and dark furniture. So his hair shows very easily. This vacuum is definitely worth the money. We vacuum about 3x a week and need to empty the chamber almost every time. Some might see that as a bad thing, but I'm happy it picks that much up. I'm super happy with this purchase.
Works well for Our rv
I am very happy with this vaccuum
Dirty but couldn't beat the cost.  I gave it as a gift, so would have liked for it to have been cleaned up a little better, but for the price, I got a good deal.
The best vaccum I've ever had!  I bought this vaccum because I saw that consumer reports had voted it a best buy and it is.  I have a dog who is allowed on my furniture and he leaves a ton on hair. This vaccum has an attachment to take care of the pet hair and it works great.  The only thing that I don't love is how heavy it is.
Amazing
Great cleaner  I have to say this in a complementary way.....this vacuum cleaner really sucks:)  I has great pick up and the hand held with a wand that extends makes it really easy to do stairs and the edge of your rugs.  Both have wonderful suction.
Great machine!  Replaced an aging Electrolux that was much larger and heavier.  This model Miele vacuum has power and an effective filter system.  It is easy to carry and store.
My Cats Love the clean Floor  I have this machine for about a year and I cannot explain how incredible this is.  I have 4 cats and they do dirt the living room, kitchen and the rest of the house pretty good.  I first vacuum all their hair from the floor and then after moving the furniture a little I start the the Floor Mate.  You should see the dirty water in the pick-Up tank, you can write a letter with it, so black and dirty it is. My back does not hurt like when I had to use a mop. The floor is dry and super clean. You can see the clean floor after that.  Is so clean that my cats stretch on the floor with delight. They all love clean things.  I cannot say more.  I Love my Hoover Floor Mate.  By the way, Amazon prices and service is second to none. Thank you Amazon, for bringing my Hoover Floor Mate to my door a year ago.
Good vacuum, love the retractable cord
good vacuum  great performance, light weight with reasonable price. love it
Best vacuum I EVER OWNED  I highly recommend this vacuum.  It is easy to use, and picks up ALL of the dirt!  The swivel mechanism is convenient.  This machine is easy to take apart & clean, put back together & use.
The product came with only a slight scratch, everything else was perfect.  Put it together and vacuumed a rug that had been vacuumed by an very old Dyson and this one picked up so much more.  Great product, great on hardwood floors and any carpet.  The beater brush and hard floor settings are great and it does get very close to the walls.  The attachments are great (refurbs do not come with the Animal No Tangle Turbine FYI) for most of what you'd need them for.  The cord is very long and able to do a lot of floor space without having to unplug and replug in somewhere else.  5 Stars, best thing I could buy to pick up my long haired dog's fur from the carpet, hardwood, and couches.  I would highly suggest to anyone who wants the quality of a Dyson but does not want to pay full price.
best tile clearer ever
Love my Rainbow  Bought a Series SE 27 years ago and haven't regretted it a moment.  I have even loaned it out to a friend and they loved it so much they want to own one.  This is the best vacuum I've ever owned.  Additionally, the year after I purchased my Rainbow, Consumer Reports did a review on it and said it was not a good product b/c it didn't have enough suction.  Really?  Then why when I was dusting the lightbulbs over my vanity, did the light come out of its base and cling to the dusting brush till I could remove it.  Yes, the suction was strong enough to remove the bulb from its base.  Replacing the bulb was definitely worth the experience and to be able to disprove what Consumer Reports put in their magazine years ago.  Can't speak for the current Rainbow(s), but would still be worth the risk of purchasing another one if I had to, based on past experiences with the one I have.
Very pleased  Very happy with this purchase. I bought it specifically for cleaning up cat litter from the bathroom floor and it fits the bill perfectly. I'm sure it would work equally well in any uncarpeted area.
Powerful AND Zippy!  So far so good! I've used it for an hour now, and I'm not sure if the heat coming out of it is normal but it didn't shut down on me so I'm happy. Maybe I'm a bit paranoid though. ;) I received my Bissell on time and in great condition. It was boxed very nicely and had everything that was supposed to be included neatly packed. The parts and the body of this vacuum were in pristine condition, no signs of wear and tear at all so I am confident that it's not someone else's castoff. Did I mention that I'm a bit paranoid? ;) The electrical cord measured 15 ft from the red line to the plug. That's pretty impressive. My house is 22x24 ft. The hose attachments, when all together, including the crevice/upholstery tool is around 8 ft. Not bad really. To get my ceilings I'd only have to put the Zing on a chair or a table and that would relieve me of having to lift it. Speaking of the crevice tool, it's kind of cool that it's a two-fer. You put it one way and it's a crevice tool, then flip it over and it's an upholstery tool. Nifty! I've read prior to when I bought this that it's not that convenient and it's true, it's not your traditional crevice tool in that it can get into thin spaces and it's not a traditional upholstery/fabric brush that covers more than an inch but it works. The suction is wow. I knew it was 9 amps but I wasn't expecting it to be such a hard worker! I have ants in this house and they love being in the gaps in the plywood that it's made of. Most of the hour I spent that I mentioned were from sucking up the ants that scurried from their nests in the cracks in the board. lol. I think I got the bulk of them but knowing ants, I doubt it. Oh and this is only on 3 walls that I've used it in so far. I haven't even touched the floor yet. Right now I'm taking a well deserved break and I'll be figuring out how to detach the bin so I can see if I have millions of dead ant bodies waiting to be thrown outside. Maybe that will be a warning to their families out there to move their anthills to another village. lol. I'll update when I'm done relaxing.
The Absolute Best, with GREAT Customer Service!  I've had this vacuum for 3 1/2 years, and it's never given me a moment's trouble.  Everything was absolutely perfect . . . until this week. (Cue: the forboding music!)  I vacuumed a friend's house, where it handled swaths of cat hair beautifully, never clogging or over-heating. Unfortunately, I also vacuumed a small amount of sawdust on the floor. All seemed well until the next day, when the vacuum would no longer turn on!  My beloved vacuum was completely dead!  WARNING: This is where it gets REALLY scary!  I took it to an authorized Dyson repair shop, where the guy gave me a list of 4 things that needed to be repaired, and and a quote of between $202 and $385!!!  When I expressed shock, he told me Dyson's weren't that good and that it would probably not last, even after the repairs.  He then tried to sell me a vacuum I'd never heard of, for $300!  I decided to do some research.  I called Dyson, and the rep. went over the list of repairs I "needed" and said 3 of them were baloney.  All I really need is a new switch.  (Sawdust and powder kill switches.) They OFFERED TO SERVICE IT THEMSELVES for $131 (inc. S&H)!  For that price, their techs would go over it and clean it and FIX ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT.  I called a different repair shop and got a $75 estimate, but the guy said "it might cost more", so I think I'll just send it to Dyson and let them handle it. I should get it back in 2 weeks, and I'll feel confident that it's properly repaired and that I wasn't cheated.  All in all, I must say, THESE GUYS ARE GREAT!  Update 4/12/12  Dyson sent me a box and everything I needed to ship at UPS, so that was easy.  I got it back in a reasonable amount of time (it's been a while, so I can't remember) and it was perfect.  They fixed the problem and the vacuum has worked like a dream ever since, nearly FIVE (5) YEARS since I sent it in.  So that means I've had this vacuum over 8 years and it's been wonderful!  Buy it; you'll be glad you did!  Definitely one of the best investments I've ever made in household items.
Excellent low cost vacuum  This is an excellent lower priced vacuum. This is a light weight vacuum that really does great job getting dirt off the floor. When we bought this after our last vacuum died I was hoping for something to get the job done until we could purchase a higher end vacuum. After a few months of owning this we are not looking for a new vacuum.
Works great, I bought this for my basement it works great on laminate flooring.
OMG - It can vacuum up carpet deoderizer  OMG.  Enough with my opinion, let me give you an example.  I vacuumed my apartment with this vacuum cleaner, then later decided to buy carpet deodorizer for a fresh smell of Hawaiian Pineapple.  The deodorizer is in powder form that you sprinkle on your carpet then vacuum up with your vacuum cleaner.  So I did it and I would say fairly quickly, then when I was done I proceeded to empty the canister.  Holy C%P, all the powder (seemed like all of it) was in the canister.  It had actually vacuumed up that fine powder, and it seemed all of it.  I just could not believe it.  No vacuum cleaner I have ever seen can vacuum up that stuff.  I also want to say that my carpet looked like it had been cleaned by a cleaner machine and I could feel the difference on my feet.  Next, the first time I vacuumed the carpet I noticed that there was a fresh smell as if the air was being purified.  This is a huge contrast to other vacuum cleaners that have a stinky smell.  If you can afford $300, buy it.  I do realize that $300 seems like a lot in contrast to your standard $79 vacuum cleaner (I was not sure if I was stupid to spend that much) but this Dyson is on a different level.  I am very glad I purchased it.
AWESOME!  The wife loves it, and as long as the boss loves it, it's great.
Delighted  I hate cleaning and will make plenty of excuses to get out of  doing it. I was trying to vacuum my home with a dirt devil vacuum that I bought for about 40$. I know, I know. What I was I? Crazy? When a big move came, I needed to get serious about my cleaning. I invested in this vacuum cleaner and I've learned (for the millionth time) that you need the right tools to do a job right. If I had known what I know now... This does it all. I couldn't believe the dirt, dust, and garbage that this vacuum got up in a few minutes. It was so easy to use, that I was inspired to do more than I had planned to do. It actually changed the shade of my carpet! I used to clean my shelves with a feather duster. No more. With the brush attachment, I did my shelves in a fifth of the time it would have taken by hand. Pet hair? This thing sucks it up without any problem. Emptying out the dirt canister took about two minutes. It also has a neat cranking mechanism to shake out the paper filter--and, boy, did the filter collect a lot of dirt! I am one happy customer. I will be dreading cleaning day a lot less now. I can't compare this to any other vacuum cleaner in its price range but if you are trying to clean with some cheap vacuum cleaner, do not hesitate to put out the money for this baby. It will lessen your work, dramatically improve the cleanliness of your home, and make your life easier.
My new Bissell 3594  I'm am very pleased with my purchase of the Bissell 3594 Cleanview Powertrak Vacuum.  It works so well with our high dense shag carpet and even on our tile floors.  And best of all no more vacuum bags.  This one is so easy to clean.  Great vacuum especially when you have two children and two dogs.
... using it for over 6 months and it works great! Very portable  We've been using it for over 6 months and it works great! Very portable, easy to clean out when it gets full, and it has great suction. It does a surprisingly good job of cleaning up cat hair.
Great smaller sized vaccuum  Lightweight machine with great suction.  Five year warranty is encouraging.  Very maneuverable.  Dirt canister cleaning very easy.  So far, both adults in the house are pleased with the unit.  Suction is much better than an older bagless Hoover that we have which loses suction frequently.
Great product and Fast Service  yes it is a great product and does just what it says I would recommend this product to anyone needing a good affordable vacuum cleaner
Great vacuum so far!  I bought this vacuum "Open Box" - "Used" on Amazon.  It was the last one of this type and the price was only $45!  Much better than what vacuums like it are selling for.  I had a Eureka before and have never been happier with a vacuum cleaner.  I had to leave it behind at my last apartment and couldn't bring it since I was getting on a plane and couldn't ship it.  I had it for 3 years and it functioned like it was a brand new, so I decided to get another Eureka.  After reading many reviews of other vacuums and checking out various ones in the stores, I decided to purchase this one after seeing it on Amazon.  It looks like a newer model of what I use to have.  Like I said, I bought it "Used", but when I got it the vacuum looked like it had never been used since it had no dust particles on it whatsoever.  It was open boxed because I could see where it had been opened before, but everything was packed individually and wrapped.  It was easy to put together and it works really well so far.  My only complain is that it's a little flimsy especially compared to the older model Eureka that I had, but it seemed like other model vacuums in the store were really flimsy as well, so for the price I'm extremely satisfied and hope it lasts for years to come.
It works great, it's quiet  ...my wife requested this :)  She loves it.  I do to.  It works great, it's quiet, engineering is...well, German.  Enough said.
very powerful for the size
Great results and easy to use  Don't know how I lived without it! Great results and easy to use.
good little  As expected ,good little vac
Good value !
Love it  I have had this almost a year, and they have done some updates to the unit.  However I have had no issues with this model, Used last night as well for more then 30min. I wish the scrubbers came out a hair more. but I just leave on the 'wash' position, it dries fast, no need to switch to the 'dry'
Outstanding!
excellent
yes like it very good/ good power
Love this vac  Love this vac.  Cord is long and it works like a charm.  We are an animal rescue and vac every day and it picks up everything
The Search is Over!  When our Roomba finally thew in the white flag after we brought home Shelby the shedding German Shepherd, we have been researching vacuums for months. We knew Dyson would likely be the only way to keep up with the hair but originally thought it was out of our price range. Until we found the remanufactured model! True to Amazon form it was delivered quickly in original manufacturer packaging and has been a Godsend ever since. We had forgotten what color our rugs were (blue! They are blue!) and thought our beige carpet had long ago turned gray. My husband and I now argue over who gets to vacuum because it is no longer a fight to get the floors clean. It even works well on our slate and hardwood. There are cheaper places to get the Remanufactured Dysons but Amazon works directly with the factory so you can't go wrong. If there are any differences to the 'new' model you'd be hard pressed to find them. Definitely a life-saver for pet owners!
Great product!  I have owned a Bissel and a Dirt Devil before deciding that it time to stop fooling around and get myself a REAL vacuum that would keep the house clean and not lose suction completely in less than 2 years. So I decided for a factory refurbished Electrolux, thinking that I can get away with both minimum pay and a great product. I was wrong. Later I went to Lowes to try a new Electrolux Oxygen and make sure that my disappointment was not related to the mere fact that my order was factory refurbished. It wasn't. The Electrolux was bad because it was bad period. I decided for Miele - my last hope. If that wasn't gonna do it, nothing was going to. Despite being the least expensive among the Miele models, this  vacuum is an absolutely great piece, better than any other vacuum I tried, including more expensive ones from other brands. It is sturdy, it is very well made, it screams quality and it does the job as an excellent vacuum should. All other brands look like garbage compared to this one. The only downside may come for those who have really big houses and would need to step up to a larger model, which in Miele terms can be a bit pricey. Otherwise - superb product!!!
I LOVE this product  I LOVE this product. Dog sheds like crazy. Sweep up hair and this item takes it all in, including sand, twigs, etc. Works like magic!!
LOVE it!! Powerful, yet quiet!!
Love this powerful little vacuum, great vacuum without the big price tag
very happy customer!!  I love this vacuum! I literally vacuum every day. The price is amazing and the quality of the vacuum is wonderful!
Great Vacuum  I like this vacuum alot-I recently adopted a Cavalier King Charles spaniel and there is hair everywhere.  Only drawback is that the hose for the attachments does not stay locked in place and it is always flopping around.  Does a good job on either hardwood floors and carpet.  I don't find it to be very heavy to push around and it almost seems just to need my direction. This was  great purchase.
Better rhan the rest  My son is an avid vacuum cleaner collector. In our home we have at least one of every vac brand on the market and have used them all.  He received this one as a Christmas gift. I have to say that I was astonished at the cleaning power of this little workhorse. You can vacuum with any of the others and go back with this one and it will get hidden yuck you could never imagine was there. This vac is a fraction of the cost of most of our vacs, but the best of them all. I HIGHLY recommend this vacuum. I was even a janitor/housekeeper for years and thus little thing out preforms even the most expensive machines that I have used. It is just incredible.
Shark is awesome
Easy to get under furniture and picks up very well  Very light weight. Easy to get under furniture and picks up very well.
This little guy is a champ. Been using for a while now and it continues to make me wonder how I get so much dirt in the house! The filter adding/removing is a bit odd- I was nervous I'd break the filter when twisting it on and off originally because takes a bit more torque than I originally anticipated, but after removing and replacing it a bunch I no longer worry.  The handle is convenient for moving it around as well.
works better then I thought  Prefect ...works better then I thought.
oreck vacuum cleaner.good product.works well, as advertised.  oreck vacuum cleaner is a fine product.well made, and does a fantastic job.arrived on time,undamaged,and in like new condition.great price also.
The best has come  I am so happy with the Shark Vac-Mop. It does a terrific job on carpeting and bare floors. The vaccuum is very light and has great manuverability. The first time I used the vac, it did such a good job picking up the dirt. Switching over to the mop attatchment was very simple. I had used a Swifter type mop 2 days before and could not believe how much dirt this steamed up after a supposedly "clean" floor.  I highly recommend this. It does not disappoint in ease and thorough cleaning.
The suction is very good and it is light weight and compact.
Mighty mini  This little vac has great suction, which can be adjusted,  good cord length & rolls easily. Great for small spaces.
Very satisfied customer!  I wasn't sure what to expect, this is the biggest item I've purchased online. (usually I only order books and dvds) But I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package. It was easy to put together and it's so lightweight! It's a powerful little thing and so light that I ended up getting one for my mom. She couldn't believe how much I had paid for it and said that it was so much better than some of her previous vacuum cleaners.  I'm very happy with the product!!
Lightweight, Quiet, but POWERFUL!  When I saw how compact this vacuum is (smaller than most regular-sized all-purpose vacuum cleaners at 12 pounds), I wasn't entirely sure what to expect.  Then I turned it on and went over my floors (medium length rug, hardwood, and braided floor rugs) and was impressed with what it picked up!  It's powerful and picks up a lot of things my previous vacuum missed - the suction is STRONG.  I've been using it every day in preference to my previous vacuum because it's lighter and easier to use, and it maneuvers underneath my furniture and between my kitchen chairs so well.  I love it!  A more detailed list of pros and cons and my thoughts on them:  Things I really like: - The adjustable handle (making it easy for my daughter to vacuum, too) - How lightweight and compact it is - The fact that you can turn the spinning brushroll on and off - The LONG cord (I don't have to switch to different outlets in my home to vacuum everywhere) - It's bagless and easy to empty - The vacuum hose extends to a very long length and can be attached in two places (for high or low hose vacuuming) - There's a carry handle on the body so you don't have to drag it around by the handle - It picks up hair and dirt WONDERFULLY  Some room for improvement: - There's no way to adjust the vacuum for different rug lengths.  For example, my braided fabric rugs are a little harder to vacuum than the regular rug because the suction is powerful and it's so low to the floor.  Sometimes things like Cheerios (I do have children) are harder to pick up than smaller dirt. - I wish there was a longer attachment for vacuuming near the ceiling or in corners I can't reach my arm into.  Overall this is an awesome vacuum and has replaced my previous one hands down.  The pros most definitely outweigh the cons in my opinion, I absolutely love that it is so light and easy to maneuver - it has saved me so much time!  Recommended.  *I received a sample of this product to facilitate my review, but my opinions are entirely my own.*
excellent  love it the best vacuum ive ever owned the Japanese know how to make a vacuum screw dyson way over priced
A must have for tile floors!  This is the only way to clean tile floors. Nothing I used before even came close. I was using Swiffer, but it left a dull film that had a tacky feel. I just used the Swiffer  three days ago, and today I used the Floormate, and the water was black! You would have thought I hadn't mopped in months. My floor looks brand new. Lightweight, easy to use, and it takes less time than other methods because the scrub brushes lift stains easier and quicker. Haven't tried it on my laminates, but I'm sure it'll do great there too. Throwing the sponge mop and the Swiffer in the trash!!
Excellent vacuum,  powerful and quiet.
Never used better... Sorry Kirby (I'll miss the memories... I think)  I have used Kirby vacuums for years.  When I met my (now) husband, I met this Eureka 5855 Boss Bag-less Upright Vacuum that he had in his entry closet.  Can you say, "Hi there gorgeous..."  Compared to my ancient Kirby vacuum this thing is a dream.  You know that old wives tale about how women go for the men with the nice cars?  Well, it's not a tale... some of us go for the men with the nice cars.  I on the other hand go for the men with the smart cleaning sense.  When my (now) husband picked this vacuum, little did he know that it would land him married with a baby on the way.    Let me explain.  I suffer from extreme allergies.  Dust bunnies are the enemy.  I rarely ever enter a home filled with carpet unless I absolutely have to, because most people just can't get their floors vacuumed enough to suit my needs.  My husbands house... ENTIRELY CARPETED and I did not complain.  Unless of course we hadn't vacuumed in a couple of weeks, then things became a bit stuffy for me.    What's great about this vacuum is the suction.  I've read the complaint about the noise on Amazon and not found the complaint on other websites, because the suction is a dream.  Who cares about the noise when after a few minutes you don't have dirty cat hair ridden dust bunnies lurking on your floor anymore?  I sure don't.  That's what ear plugs are for.  You can pick up a pair for under a buck at your local gas station if you're desperate.  I love being able to switch from carpet height to bare floor with the twist of a knob.  Granted you do have to bend over... we'll call it the bend and vac.    This vacuum comes with 2 filters.  A regular run of the mill vacuum filter that filters dust, dirt, & hair from the inside of the funnel and your Hepa filter that blocks any excess dust, dirt, & hair from getting out of the vacuum.  I love that they are separate.  The funnel filter is recommended for replacement every 3 months and we do so about every 8 months as we clean it out with a smaller hand vac.  The Hepa filter is recommended to be replaced every 3 months, but my husband and I haven't replaced it in 3 years.  We just bought some replacement Hepa filters H-5 and Eureka DCF-21 filters (funnel) at a REALLY great price (wish I could tell you where).  Look online and you'll find a lot of generic filters.  YOU WILL NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE.  The best filter is the Filtrete brand or anything that actually says EUREKA on it.  The "yellow" filters just don't match up.  We tried one and we ended up replacing it much sooner than we would normally and when we vacuumed, there was too much dust going into our Hepa filter.  We went from having a fairly clean Hepa filter after 2 years and in a matter of a few months it was really really dirty because we used the generic filter for the funnel (DCF-21 or DCF-3).  The DCF-3 is a tighter fit and is a pain in the rear (I just don't recommend that filter model/size for this vacuum.  The DCF-21 is the right fit.    What else... what else...  Um... Let's face it, the wand kind of sucks on this vacuum.  I've never understood it.  One day I'll use it and it picks up cat hair and lint like a charm and the next time I use it, I can't get it to pick up much of anything.  The consistency on the wand is somewhat annoying... but when it works right, it works well.  You see, I don't care who you are... and how much you complain about a product.  If you expect most of these products these days to withstand the test of time, then I dare say that you were raised many many years ago when things actually did.  Things have changed and every piece of machinery has it's flaws.  As for this vacuum, the cons are so minimal that you'd be a moron not to at least try it and see for yourself.    You may read complaints that after a few years the springs on this machine have broken.  Wahh, I bought some new springs (6) for under 5.00 with shipping.  The brush roll was looking a bit worn, I bought a new brush roll for under 16.00 with shipping.  What I love about this vacuum is that you can find every single replacement part on multiple websites across the internet.  Most of the replacement parts are very affordable.  I know what you're thinking... just buy another one.  Just buy another vacuum.  NO.  I've grown to love this vacuum so much that buying another one just seems silly.    Anyway... do what you want.  Eureka is the best!!
Excellent, light weight and easy to use. Ver powerful cleaner.
Dyson almost had my money!  I was in the market for a new sub$200 vacuum. I have 2 dogs, 1 cat and needed something good for carpet and bare floors. I originally had the bissell clearview bagless which is horrible for bare floors and spits back small particles at your shins plus has very poor suction, so initially i was hesitant about another bissell. The other vacuum I have is the lightweight $69 Eureka with the loop handle with a brushroll off switch wich does a decent job but no height adjustment, blows air directly in front blowing away dirt that your trying to vacuum plus the filter gets extremely clogged and I have to scrape it clean with a fork. The worst part being smell of the filter once it goes bad it stays bad and fills the room with a nasty rotten smell. So, I purchased the new Dirt Devil Reaction,there's a foam filter preceding the hepa which is out of the way so figured less direct contact with debris. For the most part it did a decent job but no brushroll off switch-horrible on bare floors, bulky, short hose which is cumbersome to re-attach. After 1 vacuuming the foam filter had a nice thick layer of fine dust, the hepa filter seemd ok. Anyway returned it back to Target. Ok, so I start saving my money for a Dyson or maybe even the new Shark Infinity, figuring there's no sub $200 that will have the features i want. Then I saw the Bissell Healthy Home for $300. Looked like a Dyson ripoff to me but hey all the better! So as I was researching the healthy home i came across the Velocity total floors, bagless, foot-activated brushroll off and height, 14' hose, turbo brush, $cheap plus it's self propelled which is not advertised. I found it at Walmart. Let me tell you this vacuum picked up so much fine dust and hair it was gross! Afterwards I inspected the 2 filters, yes just 2, 1 pre-motor foam and the hepa! expecting to find the same dust layer as the Dirt Devil and my bissell clearview. As i pulled out the foam filter it was clean! How could that be?!Then I inspected the hepa filter expecting the inner side to be black. it was clean too! WTF? How could this vaucuum with just 2 filters have no dust on them? Watch the video on the Bissell website. The outer and inner cyclonic action works! The hose reached the top of my stairs too. Bare floors performance was exceptional. there's a rubber floating windshield like rubber strip which prevents spit back and the floors felt clean under my feet not dusty like the Eureka. The dust conatiner is much larger than the clearview and easy to empty. If you look down the center you would see the dirt that would have otherwised reached the filter on other vacuums. Ok so now the cons: the brush switch is a manual clutch type so takes some effort but found by using my heel instead of my toes works best. Kinda loud but hey as long as its sucking up dirt who cares?! A telescoping handle would've been nice...And that's it. I'm keeping this vacuum, sorry Mr. Dyson I'm spending the money I saved on something else! Thank you Bissell for a vacuum that does what I want.
The suction is fantastic, I love the easy to change levels from bare floor to carpet! The swivel us amazing too!
Great vac and great customer service  We have had this LG vac for about 10 months now. It's been fault-less until the quick release between the wand and the power head got stuck...really stuck! It's always been a little difficult to release but this time - no chance. One call to LG customer support and a new wand and power head were dispatched. The replacement parts arrived 10 days later and we are up and running again. The new release appears to be a lot better than the last one, so maybe there was a fault with our original parts. Well done LG, great vac and great customer support!
In my opinion Hoover does the job much better than the more expensive ones.
Works great!  I have only used the Featherlite a couple of time, but I am very pleased with its performance. It is very easy to wheel around and has great suction for such a small vacuum. I really like that you can rinse out the filter. I also like the retractable cord.
Love the Multi floor and bagless feature  This vacuum works very well in transitioning from hardwood floors to carpet to tile.  Love not needing having to buy vacuum bags and the Dyson power!
Super little vacuum!  One of the best purchases I have ever made!!  I have four little Chi's and a long haired cat and LOTS of hair to deal with!  My upright just can't make it and I saw this, read the reviews , SO glad I took the chance.  Easy to maneuver, tons of power and the best part, DON'T HAVE TO TOUCH ALL THE NASTY DIRT, as it's in the bag.  YEA!  All the attachments work well and  am pleased with the cleanliness of my house.  Thank you, Eureka!
My best investment in a long time...  This vacuum cleaner is by far the best value in sweepers that I've ever found - and I have had several different brand/models over the past 50 years.  I am so impressed by it that I'm going to order a 2nd one for my business.
Best Vaccum  I rated it a 5 star because I found no cons with the unit.  I have no pets, so I can't rate it for that aspect. It's very expensive @ $550. If you want the best you must pay the most. Five year warranty, Very high quality & easy to use. Yes, I'd buy it again. Complaints about switch location & locking the unit in position up or down  hold no merit,  just nit picking. Tip: after emptying the dirt canister (I empty it outside in a bag) I blow it out with my leaf blower, about every 3ed empty cycle, OUTSIDE.
This is the best vacuum, that I've ever owned  This is the best vacuum, that I've ever owned, as it's so light weight and powerful. My rug didn't even look dirty when I first used this vacume and it pulled out a lot more dirt. I had recently vacuumed it with my previous vacuum (which I was looking to replace.) This does an excellent job. I then went on to do my ceiling fans, holdup the hand vac part, which was light weight for a woman to use.
This is a great vacuum for the price  This is a great vacuum for the price. We got it for our office and it is super light weight, easy to move around and has a lot more power than I would have expected. It works great on the area rugs and entry mats along with on our laminate floors. Great purchase and great price point!
It makes this husband want to vacuum  When our two year old Eureka went dead, my wife told me we needed to get a new vacuum cleaner.  The fugle shopper that she is, she didn't want to spend a lot on a new vacuum.  As I usually do before a purchase, I research the quality and effectiveness of various vacuum cleaners both online and in stores. I knew that I wanted a bagless cleaner and the Hoover windtunnels was always the recommended brand.  Even a [store] salesman recommended this model over a higher priced Kenmore. I told my wife that we could either by a[less expensive] vacuum cleaner every other year -- which requires continual purchases of vacuum bags -- or we can spend a little more for a good bagless vacuum cleaner that will last five or more years.   We bought the WindTunnel V2 (U8130-900) and we do not reget spending one penny of the price.  We immediately saw the difference in the cleaning power of the wind tunnel.  They are a little heavier then other upright cleaners, but its performance more than makes up for the extra weight.  Since most of the uprights are 12 Amps, I know the the amount of Amps does not disclose the amount of suction power a cleaner has.  Hoover has a numbering system that gives you a  rating of the suction power.  The higher the number the greater the suction.  This allows you to compare the cleaning power of all of its models.  The highest I've seen so far is a rating of 31. The V2 has a rating of 29.0 -- plenty of power.  It also is beltless, no more burning smell because your belt is not properly turning; or having to go search for a store that sells the right belt for your particular brand and model.  As mentioned in most review of this model, its canistor is large enough to hold plenty of dirt and allows you to dispose of the dirt from one side without removing the HEPA filter which is housed in the opposite side of the dirt container.  The handle is well designed with its power button within reach of your fingertip.  It also has an oval opening at the top of the handle that allows it to be lifted.  The handle reclines parallel to the floor which makes cleaning uder furinture a little easier.  It also has a switch to turn of the beater brushes while cleaning the floor.  Although my vacuum cleaner is fairly new, 5 Sept 02, and has not been battle test by time, I do know the various filter prevent any dust or odors from being released.  This makes for cleaner air, which is good for any alergy victims or thoughs who have babies and small children about the house.   The only things I wish Hoover would have added are the power hand brush, an extra hose and a retractable power cord.  The handbrush can be purchased as an accessory and comes with the higher WindTunnel V2 model which cost [a bit more].  The higher V2 model is essentially the same vacuum cleaner except that it comes with the powered brush and can be used with or without a bag; I assume the bag would provide added filtration.  The power brush also comes with a lower model that is not a  V2 and has a suction rating of 27.  The extra hose would be handy for dusting high spaces, cleaning stairs, or getting around the interior of your vehicle.  Since I have to nit-pick to find a few cons, it says a lot about this vacuum cleaner.   In conclusion, I recommend this vacuum cleaner to those who could afford to put up the money for it.  If the WindTunel's quality is as good and long lasting as many people have told me, in the long run it should save you money -- no bags, no belts, and no [lower priced] vacuum cleaners ever few years.  it's enough to make a husband want to vacuum; it has in this family.
Product works really well.
If something hppens to this jewel, I would have to buy another one  I have a 2500 plus square feet of hardwood floors so I have been looking for a fast and efficient way to clean them. I read all the reviews on innumerable products. I even tried a fair number of them.  I hesitated about the Hoover floormate because some of the reviews indicated that it leaked or did not completely vacuum the water from the floor. I could discount most of the criticisms abut the floormate but excess water on the floor was one thing that was a deal breaker for me. After I broke the second Shark steam mop, I decided to give the floormate a try.  The first time I used the floormate I was blown away by how much dirt it cleaned. I especially liked that no dirty water ever returns to the floor. The second time I used it I noticed a puddle on the floor and as I used the machine it failed to pick u[ water. OH NO Were those reviews right? Just then my husband came by, glanced at the machine and said "You switched the reservoirs." Sure enough I had put the reservoirs on the wrong side.  Once I switched them back, the machine worked perfectly once again. Now this might be a design flaw because the engineers might guess that unobservant folk would reverse the reservoirs ( if there is a way to screw things up, people will)  I suspect that several of these reviewers might have done the same thing as I,  The rest of the criticisms seem a little petty  No it's not heavy ( I'm over 60) I use it for weekly cleaning Now that I pay attention to the proper placement of the reservoirs, the machine clears every bit of water from the hardwood floors and it has never leaked Cords could always be longer I can still bend over to turn the machine on Its design allows you to clean very close to the edge No, your floor won't look as if it has been paste waxed-- is that a serious expectation?  I waited six months before evaluating this machine, but the honeymoon still goes on.
LOVE IT!  I LOVE this vacuum. It has great suction and the self winding cord makes putting it away a breeze. It is very easier to maneuver and push. I also like that the power button is on the front of the handle. The filter cleanliness level indicator is awesome, it takes the guess work out of when you need to replace/clean it.
Best vacuum EVER!!  I have had my Dyson for 9 years.  BEST vacuum I have ever had!!  Still going strong!!  Very little maintenance, and easy to do.  Just clean it up every so often, and your golden!!
Good Suction even after 14+ months of use  Suction is still going strong after a year and a half of use (about once every 2 weeks). Haven't even changed the HEPA filter either (I know gross), but that is a testament to its good suction.
Love this vac  I had a pet one like this before and did not like the filter aspect of it, but this one is so improved and with the cord winking with a push of your finger. I would recommend this to any one
Wind Tunnel vacuum continues to improve.  Wind Tunnel vacuums just keep getting better and better! There are couple of things I really like about this Wind Tunnel 2. First, it cleans the floors effortlessly and really gets the deep dirt out of the carpet. Secondly, it works well even on tile floors or wood floors.  We have pets, to include one that sheds really bad. This vacuum picks it all up with ease. Another thing I really like is the clear canister so you can see when the canister is full and you can see the dirt actually being picked up. Also, the cord rewind compartment is clear so you can actually see the cord inside the vacuum and you can see it winding up properly. When you press the rewind for the cord you should probably hold on to the plug end portion because this vacuum really brings the cord in quickly and if the cord is left to snap in it can really fly around. I like this vacuum!!  It works well and I recommend it.  We also have a Dyson Animal and have found the Wind Tunnel 2 works better at a much lower cost.
Beats other dyson models  I received DC14 full kit as a wedding gift, it worked pretty well but I was somewhat disappointed after hearing all the dyson hype.  My old vac is a hoover from the late 70's which is a real beast, it is extremely loud and you have to change the bags frequently but I felt it had more suction power than any 'modern' vac I had tried, including the DC14 and the DC15 which my parents have.  After reading the reviews here I decided to give the DC17 a shot, since several people claimed that the new level 3 root technology actually made a difference, and I am glad I did.  This model puts the older ones to shame, I assembled it at my parents house and vacuumed over a rug that had just been done with their DC15 a few days before and got a full can of fine particle dust.  Also when you put the turbine attachment on you can physically see and hear that is is propelled much faster by the DC17 than the DC15.  The turbine attachment is louder when connected to the DC17 due to the increased velocity; however, the actual noise from the units motor is noticeably quieter than the other models.  While all of the Dyson vacuums are good, this one really lives up to the hype, and it is the only model I think justifies the price tag.
Super Vacuum, for a good price.  I bought this about 8 months ago, and I love it. The air even smells cleaner when I vacuum. It's super easy to use. Now I don't even mind cleaning the house. This one came with the caddy, which holds the tools, and is wonderful for bare floors and scatter rugs. The wand has an adjustment, for the flow of air, so it keeps it from sucking the rugs up, but gets them clean. To clean larger rugs, or carpets (I wouldn't own a carpet, they're just nasty-can't put them in the washer, then you can't get them clean) you change to the head. It's super easy to change from one to the other. You just push a button to release, and pick the unit up (it's not heavy, at all). When it's time to dump the dirt, again you just push a button. I usually wash the dirt cup out, and then let it sit in the sun to dry. I hope I never need another vacuum. This one is holding up very well, so far.
works very well on all floors
I love the auto retract cord  I love the auto retract cord, the dryer sucking attachment, good hose flexibility.  Only bad thing:  Dumping/cleaning the dirt usually requires too much work.
Powerful Vacuum  Works well for picking up dog hair and dust.  Lightweight and easy to empty without having to buy bags.
Wonderful vacuum for pet hair!  First off, I'm rating the vacuum but not this particular seller (I bought mine at Walmart for a lot less money). We got this vacuum because our old one crapped out and we needed another and this was offered at Walmart. I've tried MANY other "pet hair vacuums" but all seem to get clogged or overheat after a few uses. We have two indoor cats one with short hair (who sheds constantly) and one with silky long hair (that leaves tumble weeds on the hardwood floor). This vacuum came with two tools that work especially well, one is a long stick with rubber nubs on it that allows you to get pet hair off upholstery fairly well and another that has a spinning rubber "brush" that collects the hair off stairs. It doesn't clog like the spinning brushes with the nylon bristles. Hooray! We've used this vacuum on our hardwood floors with quite a bit of success, as it didn't just blow the hair everywhere else. Then dragged it upstairs to use on the carpet. I've only had this vacuum for about a month so I can't say how long it will work, but it's worth it so far!!
Actually cleans the cat hair from the couches.
Better than a Bissell!!!!  Originally purchased the Bissell Cleanview Pet multicyclonic rewind. Returned it to target after the belt broke, after only a few months. Returned home with the Hoover Windtunnel 2 rewind. Revacuumed the rug I had just vacuumed with the bissell, and it picked up a whole bunch of dirt the bissell had left behind. Very happy with this vacuum.
WELL SATISFIED  WELL  SATISFIED
Great Vacuum  This is the best vacuum I ever owned. I am so happy with the way it picks up all the pet hair! My old vacuum could not pick up the embedded cat hair in my rugs and this one leaves nothing behind!
Works perfect in my apartment!
Works very well!
Definetely the best out there!  I have heard and wanted this vacuum for awhile now and finally decided to dish out the dough. For some odd reason, I really enjoy vacuuming and cleaning my house so this Dyson DC14 definitely does the trick. The suction is fantastic and it's really light. I had a $99 Dirt Devil which boasted the bagless technology but was nothing compared to the way the Dyson is designed. After I use it, my house actually smells cleaner and fresher. It's strange but the air system really works! There are so many other vacuums that run in the $200-$400 range so just go for it and splurge on this one! It's worth it!
Solid.  A great product for the price.  Solid.  A great product for the price.  If you're only planning to pay $50 for a vacuum, then this is the one to get.
It has great suction which dries the floors quickly  This new model is lighter and easier to maneuver over the floors.  It has great suction which dries the floors quickly.  The spin brushes are set lower for better scrubbing power.  The only thing is the clean and dirty water containers need to be removed after use or they will leak.  I have an old bucket to store them in.  I also place the liquid floor cleaner in there as well so everything I need is all together.
great  job on hard to clean tile floor--friends have used it for a year and loves it
Hoover H3030 FloorMate SpinScrub 500 Floor Cleaner  Delivered on time---at the right price. Works as advertised
Great vacuum  I am fed up with the bagless vacuums!!!!  The filters clog too often and they become quite expensive to replace.  I have been on the look out for a BAGGED vacuum at a reasonable price for a long time.  I found this one and read reviews.  I couldn't believe the price!!!  I was satisfied with what the reviews said so decided to take a chance. I am SSSOOOOOOO glad I did - It was EASY to assemble (less than 15 minutes with a headache)  and it vacuumed my carpet beautifully.  It has automatic height adjustment so I vacuumed from my carpet to my ceramic tile and it didn't miss a beat!!!  It also vacuumed edges really well - only a couple times did I have to move something away from my wall so it would suck up.  I am so impressed and I hope I can still say I LOVE it in 6 months. The only thing I wish is that it have a longer cord.
hope it lasts longer than the last one  so far so good
love  works great especially if you have a lot of pet hair to get rid of
Love it...  This is my 2nd Floormate in 10 years and I have to say on the basement floor as long as your not cleaning industrial waste it works like a dream.  This newer model with the larger two tank system is brilliant at keeping this thing going for the whole job,  the old one had a smaller clean/solution tank that constantly required refilling but this one is much improved.  I would recommend this for anyone looking for a great consumer bare floor cleaner that works great on both wood and cement floors.  Caked on dried out substances should be either scraped up with a floor scraper or treated first,  in essence use common sense and you won't be disappointed.
Best Vacuum Ever!  This is, by far, the best vacuum I have ever used...and I have used some expensive vacuums!  I use to have an Electrolux, prefer this Hoover WindTunnel over that!  The Hoover is very light in weight and very easy to use.  It has great suction.  The only negative I have found is that the hose could be a bit longer.  I LOVE the cord rewind!  Also has an indicator to let you know if the filters need to be cleaned.  Able to turn off the rotating head and have suction only to do hard wood floor.  The handle folds down for easy storage.  I am very happy with this purchase; do not regret it one bet!
My place is always nice and clean now because of this  I have to cats that I am allergic to and this picks up all the cat hair. My place is always nice and clean now because of this. Also love that it's bag less. Would def recommend!
well designed and constructed  well designed and constructed with lots of nice features. I managed to clog mine with construction debris (I should not have been trying to vacuum this) and it was pretty easy to clear out the chunks.  On the carpet it seems to work as it should. I don't have the equipment to attest to how well it actually cleans carpet.
Great!  It arrived early and works as expected on our hardwood floors.  Great!
It is easy to use, handy and portable!
GO BAGGED!  A gem....it inhales everything the bagless did only I just toss the filled bag instead of having to hold my breath when emptying a canister because all that got sucked up tried like the dickens to get back into the air as it was emptied and then the washing and rinsing began.  Love the light which is a rarity anywhere, and the light weight.
Great product at its price point.
1 Month in and Very Pleased  My old Bissell had finally gotten weak, so I when I got this new one, I was very surprised at how well a machine could work. With the brush barely touching the carpet, it practically pulls itself across the floor. I should have traded up long ago. It lifts up my tired carpet fibers and gives the room a much nicer appearance.
Awesome Vacume  This vacume is a great deal. We noticed a difference in the cleanliness of the carpet right away. I would highly recomend this vacume.
It's perfect - highly recommend! A+++
In love with dirt devil  This is the best vacuum cleaner ever. I previously owned a dirt devil while living in an apartment, but it wasn't enough to hold up against the cleaning needs of a 2000 Sq foot home once I moved. This vacuum has great suction power and the attachments work beautifully. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a bang for your buck deal.
rolls along SO easily and suction is great  Very lightweight, rolls along SO easily and suction is great! Will stop suctioning if filter is clogged, but the filter is super easy to clean.  Cord is just a little on the short side.  Overall, a great little vacuum for hard wood/tile!!
Awesome buy!  Absolutely love this vacuum, it picks up everything even dust you can't see! It's worth it and the price is reasonable too!
Works just fine  Very powerful so does a great job. Easy to hook up, disconnect, store. Also easy to move around while cleaning.
Eureka  Plenty of suction and works fine for my hardwood floors. The handle has a plastic ring to control the suction, but it doesn't have any detents and your hand can easily move it without knowing.
The best there is!  It has taken me 3 years to get this machine I finally have one.  I had one in the UK and loved it.  My husband here was "That's too much money for a vacuum."  Well our daughter is 2 1/2 and has been constantly sick - allergy induced asthma, sinus infections.  No triggers known.  I finally told him WE NEED THIS MACHINE!!! He gave in!  Firstly he was both amazed and disgusted by what was in our carpets! but more importantly we have seen a marked improvement on our daughter.  Seems dust is one of her allergies and even though I cleaned everyday this vacuum takes it one step further to deep clean, easily and efficiently.  This is one of the must have things of all time in my opinion.  Now my husband loves it too - shame it took 3 years though!
Wonderful purchase for my college daughter with 2 dogs and a cat.  She went from sweeping a rug to vacuuming with her Dyson and is very happy with the difference - and who wouldn't be?
Love this vacumn  This is the best little vacumn ever. Lightweight and great ability to get the dirt up, it makes me want to vacumn. Seeing the mass of dirt in the cylinder prompts me to vacumn even more. I bought if for my 85 year old parents, and my Dad loves it too. Easy to use, lightweight and powerful.
This vacuum is so lightweight and does a wonderful job. Surprisingly powerful for such a little unit  This vacuum is so lightweight and does a wonderful job. Surprisingly powerful for such a little unit.  Easy to empty canister  Downside is the battery life, it isn't very good, only about 10-`12 minutes on high, 15-I minutes on low. I bought a certified refurbished one and overall am very pleased with it, the only complaint is while charging the blue charging/power light keeps flashing rather than being solid blue while charging. I wasn't sure if it was getting fully charged, I called customer service at the company I bought it from, they were very helpful and sent me a new battery pack to see if that was the problem, it wasn't, it still flashes but I know I am getting a full charge. I double checked the running time with a friend of mine with the same model, she gets exactly the same running time of mine.  I have health issues that make it very difficult for me to vacuum and I can finally vacuum with this little beauty!!
You will love it!  Great vacuum for the price and more! I have 6 indoor dogs! Its kpieing up with them!! It is simple to put together, has a fikter for scented oil dropa or fragrance, picks up great, has a.nuce ling cord, is super easy to empty without getting your hands dirty and has 5height adjustments along with the floor to floor feature! I think youd be hard pressed to do better.
Hooever Platinum Upright  Love this vacuum!  It is light, quieter than most vacuums and picks up everything.  It even has a canister for cleaning corner, blinds and those hard to reach places.
Great product for the price  Great product for the price. They work very well, lightweight and tools are very easy to use and change out.
I love it!  I just got it and used it today. My carpet looked clean before I used it and I was surprised at the amount of dirt it sucked up. I shampooed my carpet 2 months ago and this vacuum picked up fine powdered dirt that I didn't know was there. I love it! I don't care for the design of the handle but even with that, I'm giving it 5 stars because it was simple and very effective to use.
Bissell Vacuum Cleaner  I bought this vacuum cleaner as a Christmas present for my son.  My son loves it!  He said he couldn't believe what ended up in the vacuum cup when he vacuumed his apartment.  No complaints at all.
Great  Good
just love this vacuum!!!  Very easy to put together, didn't need to read the directions at all! I currently have an oreck that I thought worked well and I just got this for an extra on the upper floor and I will never use my oreck again.  Cannot believe how much more it picked up after using my oreck!
I love, this is my second one  I love ,this is my second one,long cord makes a world of diffiance suction is supper would recommend for any house hold. will not be disappointed tried others not pleased at all. Not writing a review for the purpose of the product in sales ,writing it because it really works I will always have one. I actually have two because of having three levels of home.
A most excellent vacuum.  We bought this vacuum after much research. We determined it to be the best buy for the money. After receiving it, we used it, and realized our old vacuum was not anywhere near as good. I would recommend this to anyone. A very good device. Easy to clean. The only drawback I have seen is that it is very dusty to empty the collector cup.
Good little vacuum for the price, get clean very short carpet
THE best vacuum cleaner I've ever had  I have two retrievers.  I swore I was going to die of dog hair inhalation.  With two vacuum cleaners in the house and constant vacuuming, nothing seemed to work.  I even bought a set of clipping shears thinking I should shave them. Along came the dyson animal.  I've never seen ANYTHING like it.  BUY IT - you won't be disappointed.
Love this vacuum  I've been using this vacuum for 2 months now and have been very impressed with it.  The unit is lightweight but durable and provides great suction.  I use it at the quiet setting and this is more than enough power for hardwood floors, carpeting, and area rugs.  The attachments are good and again, great suction for any job I've used it on.  Doesn't come with a beater brush - but it really doesn't need it since the suction is so good.  Cord could be a little longer. All in all I don't think I would want anything else in a vacuum.  It's a pleasure to use!
Animal.... Sucks Like A Beast!!!!   There's so much to like about this creature - though all critters have a stank or two.  For the money the quality is very high and the warranty is splendid. My only gripes would be that the turbine head loses power and often stops for no reason even on low-pile carpets and rugs... It's not that it's snagging up with spun hair wrapping around the brushes, as removing and replacing the head often starts it whirring up to maximum again. I also wonder how such a sparsely-tufted turbine brush head can really be *sweeping* deeply. Perhaps it's all down to experiencing the maximum suction you've ever felt below your waist and the niftiest manouevrability from a vacuum module that needs no bags and just a once-a-month cleansing wash for the permanent filter. I love my DC39!
Favorite Vacuum i have ever owned!
I have three pugs and this vacuum works great. Pugs shed like crazy and I was drowning in dog hair. This has great suction and it is easy to switch to the hose.
Works great, looks great, has great price. What more can you ask?  Compared many different models, including those recommended & rated by Consumer Guide. In doing so, was very surprised to learn this vacuum model was rated in the top five for vacuum cleaners. The price is about a third of what the top of the line brand cost. I purchased this model for pet hair removal and general house work. In short, could not have asked for more. Its bagless, its filters are reusable (can clean) and the dirt container is a good size. If you want bells and whistles, spend $600.00 or more on higher priced brands. If you want a solid vacuum that is well made and works as advertised, this is as far as you need to go.
Hoover WindTunnel Anniversary Upright Vacuum  This product was rated a best buy by Consumer Reports in 2010. It is everything as advertised. This unit has excellent power, effective bag filtration and my wife has no trouble using it with the self propelled feature. She has had two hip replacement surgeries.
Great Product  Perfect for my needs. Easy to empty cannister. Great product.
A great, powerful value...cleans very well.  This is a very basic, yet powerful vacuum cleaner...I find it a little hard to maneuver sometimes, as the hose is a little cheap.  But, I wanted a hepa filter on my vacuum without spending tons of money.  There is a weird flow adjusting hole that hurts if your finger gets sucked into it, but I covered it with several layers of black electrical tape, which has worked fine.  The pet paw works well on upholsterey and some rugs.  I wish it had a retractable cord, but it is such a good vacuum cleaner, I can overlook it not having bells and whistles.  I like the compact size too...stands on end in the closet.  I've had it for about 3 years now with no issues...one of my siblings has a $600 Miele, and I honestly don't like it as much as my Might Mite, fwiw.  The hepa filter is barely showing any dust, so the bags I ordered are working well too.
As far as I'm concerned, you can't beat a Dyson Vacuum.  I have two long haired cats and Dyson is the only vacuum that will actually get all the fur up.  I love the style of this vacuum and it's not as bulky as most vacuums.  My place is small and I can get into areas that a regular vacuum won't go.  I'm so glad I finally bought it.
After the first use My wife and I were really glad we ordered this machine we have tried using the shark steam mop, swiffer and other products similar to those and they never really got our tile floors clean, but the powered spinning brushes of the Floor Mate managed to get the stains that we would usually have to scrub numerous times up in a single pass. The fact that it vacuums up the dirty water from the floor makes them dry quickly and with out  the streaky look we get with the swiffer mops.
Works as advertised love it
my wife was very happy with the performance of this vacuume  I bought it to replace an old vacuum cleaner..my wife was very happy with the performance of this vacuume.
Winner, great dirt detector!  Love this model vacuum. works great, hose kind of short. save your old brush with soft bristles, this hand brush is junk.
I love my Mighty Mite  I had a Eureka Mighty Mite that I used almost daily (pet fur) for 36 years and was lost when it finally died!  I replaced it with the Pet Lover model and it works great - and, would be lost without it!!  I plan on buying another one for our cabin.
Great Vacuum  Best vacuum we've ever had. We had vacuumed our house four days prior to receiving this one, and were amazed at how much this thing picked up. After seeing what this thing picked up I wouldn't even call what we were doing before vacuuming. If this vacuum has a drawback, it is weight. It is very heavy, and if you have a large home to vacuum you will be getting a workout. Overall, as expected for the price.
great
this is a very good vacuum cleaner for the price.  this is a very good vacuum cleaner for the price. it has very good suction power.
Love my Dyson  I love my new Dyson wish I would have purchased one a long time ago. I was tired of buying $250.00 vacuum cleaners that would break within about 2 years or less. I have 3 large dogs that create a lot of dust and dog hair, also live in the country. The first time I used my Dyson after I had just vacuumed with my old vacuum I got a full canister of dirt and dog hair. The suction on this vacuum is excellent and I love how it transitions from carpet to our laminate flooring. All the attachments are great and love how they all just snap in really easy.  Another huge plus is I have lower back problems and vacuuming really hurts my back. This vacuum is so light compared to others and just glides along this is a HUGE plus for me.  I compare it to a regular push lawn mower and the Dyson is like a self propelled lawn mower....lol  It does take a little getting used to how it pivots on the ball so it turns different than what I was used to.  So far I would say it's worth the investment! It's the modern day Kirby without weighing 100 pounds.
Great vacuum, great price  Great little canister vac for the price.  Easy to maneuver and easy to empty.  I am happy with it.
Nice vacuum cleaner!  So far, so good  I received the vacuum cleaner yesterday and have used it throughout my apartment on carpeting and linoleum. It was easy to assemble and it does the job very well; a bit heavy to push around, but not challenging. The product comes with an extra belt - I gather from other reviewers that these belts breaking is a problem and replacements are only available through the company. Reading the directions, the belt doesn't sound easy (for me) to replace, but the company has a "product support" option in the orders section which could be a big plus.
dirt devil mo85590 bagged upright  I bought this after a Rainbow and a Eureka Altima bagless.  I thought I loved the Rainbow, until I got sick of the whole water thing....Then, I thought I loved the Altima, until it started smelling b/c of all the filters.  So...I read about the Dirt Devil MO85590 bagged upright for 40 bucks.  wow!!! The bag lasted about 3 weeks...and I have 3 dogs inside. The noise doesn't bother me at all.  This little vac picks up my oriental carpet (5x7 size) when I go over it,  and my whole carpeted area in the living room looks fantastic, like a model house!  Some say you get what you pay for...I say you get what you pay for when you buy from a super vac dealer...Dirt Devil.  My only cons...cord not quite long enough and no carpet height adjustments...  Would I buy it again?  yep!!
Vacuum was a gift.  This was a gift for my daughter for Christmas. I have one just like it. She loves it
Great scrubber and cleaner  Wow!!  Very impressed!!  Very light weight and easy to move. Tanks fill and empty easily. Did a great job on my tile and grout. Wish the cord was a little longer, but certainly not a deal breaker. Floors were washed and dried quickly.
Best vacuum I've ever purchased  I am so satisfied with my vacuum. The suction is so powerful that you can "feel" it picking up particles from the carpet because you have to use a little force to push it across the room. Its lightweight and easy to use. Would definitely buy again.
Couldn't ask for more  I was frustrated with the carpet being so unclean. We had a kenmore heavy duty vacuum cleaner before. It did its job well for 5 years and lost suction power. Worst of it was, human hair got stuck in the rotater. Had I maintained it from the beginning, it would have lasted even longer. But it was time to change to a new better one and thats when I chose dyson ball. It works like a charm. We now see what we had been missing. Between a rubber carpet rake (yes we still use this before running the vacuum cleaner) and dyson, we pretty much keep our carpet free of human hair, clean and look as new. Highly recommend it.
so good..  So far, so good...no issues..works good
VERY GOOD VACUUM FOR THE MONEY  This vacuum is well worth the $200 I paid for it. I lucked out on the price, I know they usually sell for more. It has terrific suction, both as an upright and with the wand and attatchments. I have used it on carpet and tile and wood flooring. Excellent pickup, with no spitting out of particles on hard surfaces. Even my Dyson has a bit of a problem with hard surfaces. It actually has suction on the sides, which so many claim to have and do not. The beater brush can be turned on and off with a switch right on the handle. To empty the canister it requires 2 hands, where the dyson only takes one. Still empties very easily once you get the hang of it. Love the lower profile, it fits under my cabinets easily. It is not as easy to maneuver as the Dyson, but close. The attatchments are all on board and work WELL. I've had no tipping and leave the hose in the bottom clip as instructed. Even my Dyson has smacked into me when using the wand, when you pull and the wheels are aligned with you it will follow you. This is a great main floor vacuum. I no longer have to lug my Dyson up and down the steps! I shudder to think of taking this one up and down. It is heavier then my other one, but seems built to last! I prefer self adjusting height, but isn't a huge deal to bend down and change the height setting manually. 5 year limited warranty is great. It is truly a fantastic vacuum. My one and only complaint is the fact that the hepa has to be changed 2x a year. Otherwise, wow.
I highly recommend this machine  I would highly recommend this little machine. After mopping and rinsing, the old fashion way with a regular mop, I used my FloorMate and you wouldn't believe the amount of dirt that had been left on that floor.
Hoover bagless canister vacuum  This canister vac was bought as a Christmas present for my daughter in law who loves it.  It does just what the manufacturer said and cleans all items in the house extremely well.  It's much easier to use than the older model canister vac by the same company.
love it  Love this best vacum for prove when comes to allergies and asthma love can go from carpet to hardwood easily
:)
Replaces Old Kirby  I had an old Kirby vacuum. The tools were very hard to access. I bought this Hoover and I LOVE it. I was amazed at all the dirt that came up in just 3 uses and the carpet was standing up so much more. I am very glad I bought this vacuum. When it arrived one of the wands was crushed. I called Amazon and had a new vacuum in 2 days. It was so easy to deal with Amazon. My whole experience was wonderful and my vacuum is great.
Great product, light weight and efficient.
Best vacuum cleaner!!!!!!  I am 82 and have owned a lot of vacuum cleaners is my life and this one is heads and tails above all others.  Very well designed for most vacuuming.  It will do what they claim which is a lot!
Very glad we chose this over a Dyson  Love this vacuum--easy to steer, does a great job on all my floors and no "just-vacuumed" dusty smell in the house afterwards.  We babysat a black lab for 2 months and it took up her hair from the carpet in one pass.  Does create a lot of suction and so is much harder to push on the carpet than on vinyl flooring (not impossible, just a good arm workout).  Canister is easy to empty, though care does need to be taken to clear the holes around the HEPA filter in the upper part of the canister as these plug up over time. All the attachments store up perfectly on the unit.  Our other consideration when buying this was a Dyson animal (41?); very glad we saved our money.
Dyson Vacuum  I have always purchased other brands in the past. A friend had recommended Dyson and that they had one they purchased several years ago and it had exceeded their expectations.  Then I read an article about the creator of Dyson in INC.magazine and it convinced me that it was worth the investment.  It was easy to assemble and it works great.
The vacuum was easily put together and very easy to use  The vacuum was easily put together and very easy to use. It is light weight and easy to move from room to room. I especially like the retractable cord.
No regrets  I really like thius vacuum! It is very quiet, but it really does the job. My carpets have never looked so good,it does remove cat hair. It works well on wood floors also and is able to get hard to reach areas. It is expensive, but it does make the job much easier.
This thing really sucks!  That's a good thing!  I've always vacuumed just before running my carpet cleaner and always ended up clogging the cleaner with hair.  I have an English bulldog who loves to roll on the carpet. I vacuumed and cleaned a week before the Dyson arrived and had to empty it twice the first time I used it!  I only have one bedroom and a short hall with carpet, but apparently I hadn't gotten it very clean in a very long time.  I love how well it works on the tile in the rest of the house as well.  Like everyone says, not much on storage, but heck if I have a Dyson I don't mind leaving it out :)  For this price, you can't go wrong.  Great Vacuum.  g
Initial use of this item...  A very strong vacuum cleaner that appears to really take up the fine cat hairs in the house.  I just used it once since purchasing this Eureka product and it worked beautifully.
I am pleased with the performance and quality
A wonderful quiet machine!  This bagless upright is great!  The attachments are all easily removable and click right back into place.  The machine is very quiet and has great suction.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!
Nice and lightweight. It does a great job.  Love this little vacuum. Had a bit of trouble when I moved it from downstairs to up. A screw fell out of it, and it took quite a long time to find out where it went. Then it didn't want to stay closed.  Martha
I love this vacuum  I love this vacuum, I put aside our $400 vacuum and have mainly switched to this one for the whole house. The suction is powerful and it's easy to empty the dirt after vacuuming. It's light so I can carry it to all floors of our triplex. If anything breaks, I don't mind just buying another since it's affordable, i've had for a year now and I don't have any complaints. It doesn't get hot like my other vacuums did.
excelente
Best thing I have ever had!  I AM IN LOVE! I have 2000 square feet of wood floors and this vacuum has been such a dream! It has amazing suction, light weight, and moves easily around as you vacuum. It "dusts" the floor as you clean and I love the telescopic handle! I wish I had bought this years ago!
Was very easy to assemble and is a very powerful vacuum  Got this due to my vacuum dying.  Was very easy to assemble and is a very powerful vacuum.  Im glad I got it when it was 50 dollars.
wonderful  With two Aussir Shep. mixes, we have lots of dog hair around the house. This vaccuum is most definitely worth saving up for. It cleans carpet and tile like none other. 100 % satisfied.
The best one I've ever had   ,
I have finally found an inexpensive vacuum cleaner that sucks up anything on my carpet  I have finally found an inexpensive vacuum cleaner that sucks up anything on my carpet.  It is lightweight and easy to manage.  Most of all, I do not have to continuously vacuum the same area a few times in an attempt to get the results I get now.
Powerful, maneuverable & affordable  From the first time I turned it on until present I still laugh at the power of this machine. It is quieter than the Orecke XL it replaced and for the initial uses in this six cat household continued to vacuum up waht the Orecke left behindenough cat hair to go into the natural yarn business. Slide it forward, walk backwards and watch (and feel) he carpet raise up in its awesome sucking maw. The canister fills with cat hair & debs in a tightly swirled bezoar in the proximal canister, which takes some patient probing to pull outthe machine does not lose suction power. Flick of the wrist steering is marvelous over carpets and seemingly frictionless over hardwood floors. I considered the Dyson Animal and have zero regrets about the Hoover.
A very good pick up  can't believe the amount of cat hair and dust this picks up, and I use it twice a week on my carpets and rugs.  Keep the filters clean as the directions state and it will perform as promised.  Great buy for the money.
Awesome Vacuum  This is the second Eureka vacuum cleaner that we buy, this one is incredibly powerful and efficient, my wife is extremely happy with it. Highly recommended for wood and carpet floors.
Very powerful!
Great suction. High tank capacity. Best vacuum I've ever owned. I love this!
Robots need to know their limitations  I have this Neato floor cleaning robot (which I would recommend although I didn't get it from you-know-who) and it needs to know where not to go. This magnetized strip, easily cut with scissors and laid across doorways and stairs, keeps it in bounds. Nothing else will serve.
Love it!  I purchased this vaccum from a retailer other than Amazon but I love it so much I feel the need to leave a review here. (I use Amazon to check reviews before I buy anything). I LOVE this vacuum. I have a toddler and a giant, long haired dog. I have to vacuum every single day but it's not a miserable chore with this vacuum. It gets every bit of dog fur (and believe me there is a TON of fur) and all the ground up Cheerios from the carpet. The tools make it very easy to get hard to reach places. I always hated cleaning my ceiling fan but with the specialized tools I can just vacuum it off and call it a day. I have no problems getting behind and under furniture. I am even able to deep clean my car with all the tools.  My only complaint is that the canister is smaller than my last dyson. I pretty much have to empty it after each room but it's a small price to pay considering how great this works.
great buy  Very satisfied. I've had this vacuum for about 6 months & it works wonders. Haven't had a problem with it yet. It vacuums my carpet & hardwood floors fine. You will not be disappointed!
Love this vacuum  Got this as a Christmas gift (yes I actually asked for a vacuum) and I'm in vacuum love. Cleaned my house and stairs and I'm so happy with the suction and power. My carpets actually look cleaner with very satisfying vacuum lines haha. Easy to empty the canister and I love love the pet hair attachment. Goodbye lint rolling my couch!! Doesn't lay flat to get under furniture but details like that don't bother me at all. I just move whatever I need to clean behind.
Great little machine  I've had this vacuum about 2 months now and I have to say that I am very satisfied with it. We have 1200 square feet of white tile in our condo, every little bit of dirt shows, this vacuum easily cleans it all. Just keep the battery charged up and you're good to go. I bought it primarily for the cordless feature so it would be easy to just grab it and clean up without having to wrestle with a cord. It does a great job of picking up cat hair, dirt tracked in and kitty litter. If you're serious about buying a cordless vacuum, STOP LOOKING!
PERFECT! WORKS GREAT!  Love this! Easy to use and especially for the hard to reach places where you can easily take apart for mobile needs like if you have a spider web in the top corner this vacuum is perfect for the job!
My son's Dyson "died" after many years of valuable service, and I replaced it with this Bissell. My son is very impressed with it and raves about it! He claims it outperforms his Dyson. I have my doubts about that, since I love my own Dyson Animal with my big German shepherd dog - but as long as it cleans the boy's house, I'm happy!
Worth the Price  This vacuum really sucks!  Nice features and the fold down handle is great for sticking in the closet.
This is nice  I owned an earlier version of this vacuum. It lasted for years. Glad I found a newer model. I hope it last half as long
Nice  We already had one dyson, i am not sure why we got this  but it have adopted it as my new main vacuum.  The cord is shorter than my other one so now I have to love the cord more often  and I am not sure it picks up as well as the other model,  but it definitely moves around the floor a lot easier.
and it's been a great vacuum. We have two German Shepherds  I've had this for quite a while now, and it's been a great vacuum. We have two German Shepherds, so it gets a workout daily.
BEST VACUUM I HAVE EVER OWNED  BEST VACUUM I HAVE EVER OWNED!!!!!! i cant believe how well this vacuum works makes my carpet look like new and picks up deep down dirt that my $300 vacuum couldn't get... Amazing product
Excellent Product!  I've had almost every kind of vacuum around and they all had their drawbacks, so I was surprised by this machine. I have back/neck problems so I am delighted that this Hoover is very lightweight and easy to handle. No struggling with cords or bending to reach this, that or the other. It is very logically designed. Extremely good suction power even with the hose & attachments. Easy to empty canister and filters are also easy to get to and can be rinsed to clean instead of needing to be replaced. The attachments are perfect for pet hair because they are smooth plastic that doesn't become clogged with hair when used. Really worth a try even for a skeptic.
Great purchase for soft carpets and people who have shedding dogs  I almost never write reviews, but because I am so happy with how this vacuum worked on my carpet, I thought I'd mention a few things that didn't get said in other reviews that I'd read.  I recently had very soft dense carpet installed in my home. When I went to use my usual vacuum, it was very hard to push through this new carpet, it was actually more of a workout. Thinking I only needed a vacuum that had more adjustable settings, I set out looking at different vacuums cleaners. After reading several reviews, one mentioned that if you have soft carpet you needed to purchase a Soniclean Soft Carpet Vacuum Cleaner. So I read the reviews on the Soniclean and decided to make the purchase. I'm so glad I did! I have a Husky that sheds and leaves hair anywhere she pretty much walks. This vacuum had no problem picking up the hair on the carpet. I also have a big area rug in the middle of my family room that is maroon in color and shows every bit of her hair. After using this vacuum, there was no hair visible on it either! It actually sucked up the hair much better then my old vacuum that would suck up most of the hair, but I'd  have to go over it several times to get it all picked up. The Soniclean did it on the first pass.  It states in the instructions about opening the vents on the front of vacuum to help the vacuum roll easier on your carpet, I did not need to do this at all, which does give it better suction. I'm glad the vacuum comes with one bag already installed which was nice so I can decide if I want to buy them which I probably will because of all the dog hair. It also comes with one of the fragrance pods. I did put that in and although it smelled fine, I only noticed the smell while I was actually vacuuming, not after, so I doubt I will be purchasing those. Another thing I noticed was with my other vacuum cleaners, dust and hair would actually accumulate on the front/top part of the vacuum while I vacuumed. When I saw the head of the Soniclean vacuum was black, I almost groaned thinking how dusty this would look after my first vacuum, but it actually didn't accumulate any dust or hair on the head part of the vacuum. Not sure why, but I'm not going to complain. I also checked the roller underneath after vacuuming and there was no hair caught around that either. I did have some issues with my other vacuum doing that, not much, but it did. The other thing I really like was how long the cord was. My family room is really good size and I could actually vacuum the whole room without moving the cord to another plug in. I know it's hard to spend $300.00 on a vacuum cleaner, but I feel like the expense was worth it as long as the vacuum holds up. If there are any changes in the next few months with this vacuum, I will come back and revise my review.
Best vacuum I've ever owned !
we use this with our parrot. She likes to drop shells and feathers on the floor. This makes cleanup a breeze.
Love this product!
I LOVE this thing  I LOVE this thing. I have 2 black and white cats and cream colored carpet so constant vacuuming in a must. It even picks up the litter very well, I love the little pedal that pulls the chord back in.
Love it....have two of them...have one for the office and one for home!
Great vacuum!  Pet friendly
Excellent! Great product, reasonable price, easy to assemble, prompt shipping/delivery.
It has different settings for carpets and its easy to use  My husband and I have been really impressed by this vacuum! It has different settings for carpets and its easy to use :)
Cheaper and better than most  As a single guy the vacuum is perfect. It's small, cheap and powerful. Just as good as any $100 upright vacuum. I'm very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend.
Works great.
I like this vacuum over the newer Dyson Animal upright as that vacuum has a very small canister and is difficult to empty.  I got ticked at spending around $500 on a newer Dyson Animal (three years ago) because the vacuum tubes on my original Dyson Animal (14 years plus) has more duct tape than actual hose at this point.  I was not happy with the newer model and looked elsewhere for a handheld option.  After trying a couple (Black & Decker and Bissell), here I am back again to Dyson.  Other brands just don't have the sucking power that Dyson provides for picking up animal hair.  This model with the canister is easy to use on furniture and a provided  attachment works for keeping my furniture hair free perfectly.
Omg love this vacuum  Omg love this vacuum! Works great on all floor surfaces. Sucks up everything too. Easy to assemble and operate
love this shark  Appropriate name, this is powerful vacuum. Small, light weight and easy to use
Great Vacuum!  Highly recommend.  This has been the best vacuum I've ever had.  If I do end up ever having to get a new one, this brand will be one I'll be sticking with.
Does a great job on hardwood floors.
What a wonderful vacuum!  It astounds us each time we vacuum the house at how much dust, dirt and debris it picks up.  Also, easy to empty.  There was a strange mix-up because it went on sale for $50 less and our order was canceled without notification.  When I checked on it, I had to order it again at the lower price.  Totally worth waiting for!
Fantastic Cleaning and Great Value!  I own a Sirena and I love it!!  We did a demo for another comparable water vacuum and decided not to ' keep it.'  After seeing how effective a water vacuum is versus a traditional vacuum..... I was sold!  I'm so happy to have found the Sirena!  In my opinion it cleans very, very  well and I adore the fragrance in my home as I am cleaning. It is well built and I feel I will get many years of use out of it.  It has been one of my best buys!
Best vac ever!  Best vacuum we've ever owned. Love it more than our old Dyson and Kirby!
Great!  I absolutely love it! I bought it to use just in my bedroom and it works great. It has great suction and leaves my rug feeling soft and clean. Emptying it was easy too! I really liked how it bends down to almost a complete 180 degrees so I was able to get under my bed very easily.
love it  I have had it for several months and so far it has lived up to my expectations ..light weight and easy to move with good suction. It is easy to store. The cord is a bit short but I just move it to different outlets. I would recommend,especially for hardwood and tile floors. Arrived on time from seller and packaged well.
This is a very powerful vacuum for the money,  This is a very powerful vacuum for the money, i even bought a second one for a back-up cleaning the filters makes a world of diffence
Love it. Light weight but works great  Love it.  Light weight but works great.  Powerful pickup
Really like this little vac for getting in small places.  Very light to carry around.
the best  This the very best vac for any pet owner, I use it in homes with multiple shedding dogsan it works great
All good  This vacuum is the best I've ever used.  It's easy to empty, to push, and it cleans so very good.
Hoover Floormate, lifesaver!  Surely counts down scrub time on hardwood floors.
Light, cleans very well, exactly what I needed for a second vacuum in the basement that is mostly tile floor.
Best Vacuum  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dyson-DC25-Ball-All-Floors-Upright-Vacuum-Cleaner/dp/B0014E3GM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dyson DC25 Ball All-Floors Upright Vacuum Cleaner</a>  The Dyson Ball Vacuum cleaner is the best cleaner I have ever used in my 79 years,  It is lightweight, very easy to empty, rolls every where and gets all surfaces clean. The only problem was that the assembly instructions were not for dummies but with a little imagination it goes  together fairly easily without any tools.
Great vacuum.  I use it every day to clean.  It is easy and fast and picks up as well easy shot does.  I like being able to go places that the corded vacuums can,t.
No more hand scrubbing  Pros:  Got my floor cleaner than any other methods I've tried.  No more crawling around on hands and knees with a scrub brush and bucket.  Cons:  Leaves little drips of water when you move it or when it sits after use, but I think that's to be expected.  It's shooting out water and getting wet underneath, so it's logical that there would be drips until the machine dries out.  I had a little trouble getting the handle attached because the screw wouldn't go in.  The holes were a little small, but I gently whacked the screw with a hammer and got it in place.  Once together, I spent a couple of hours going very slowly over my kitchen floor, and I was amazed at the dirty water I got up.  This was after using the Swiffer Wetjet, too.  I've got dogs and they seem to track in mud year-round, so I've struggled to keep the floor somewhat clean.  As for the dripping, you have to expect a little bit.  It's easier to push this around and wipe up a few drops of water afterwards than scrub the whole floor by hand. Once done, I let the machine sit in the shower to dry out.  I think I'm going to be very happy I bought this.
Gets the job done!  love it light weight, powerfull suction  great buy!
Powerful. Great Price.  I bought the T-Series WindTunnel Pet Rewind Bagless Vacuum on sale during Amazon Prime Day. I have a toddler and a dog that is labador  mix. Needless to say that my vacuum gets a lot of use. We also have high pile carpet (Who thought bringing high pile/shag carpet back was a good idea?) Soon as it arrived I had to try it out. I was mortified by the amount that it picked up. I never realized how awful my old vacuum was. I could go on and on but I'm just going to make a pro's & con's list to make it easier. Pro's Handle folds down for easy storage Easy switch option to turn on/off rotating brush Power switch is on the handle Multiple settings for high/low carpet Awesome suction power Mini roller attachment Easy to clean/empty canister Great for bare floors  Cons Kinda heavy Short power hose Cord rewind occasionally sticks
Great Value Vacuum!  What a great price for a pretty powerful bagless vac! Love that you can lower and raise the brush on the floor attachment and the small attachments do come in handy.  Why pay a ton of money for a canister vac when this one works great and stores away easily
My $400 Hoover? Lame by comparison!  This thing is fantastic.  I have had to have my Hoover Windtunnel repaired twice now.  It is self-propelled, and it has to be because it weighs 8000 pounds and still doesn't pick up dirt as well as this cheapo Bissel I found abandoned when a renter moved out.  It was crammed FULL from hose-end to motor with dirt, crayons, etc. I tore it apart and cleaned it up, and I have LOVED it ever since.  It is light enough to cart up and down the stairs with ease and has a very long cord.  I think the key to all of these types of units is to keep the filters clean. All I do is take my out, pound them on the driveway a few times, then hit them with the hose... then let them set over an air-vent in my laundry room with the dirt cup over them to dry.  I do that about 4 times a year.  Otherwise I just do the pavement pound on them every 4 times I empty the cup. Dream if you will that there is a better vacuum out there, but all you will do is pay more money!  Trust me on that!
Great Value  I bought this vacuum with high hopes and it surpassed all of them. We just carpet cleaned our carpets a couple weeks ago, and I was astonished at how much dust this pulled out of my carpet.  A couple things to be aware of...  The vacuum isn't very wide. I actually like this because its easier to fit between furniture, and it is so light that I don't mind having to make smaller "tracks" to cover the entire room.  You'll be emptying the canister every time you use it. Even on carpet I thought was pretty clean, the canister did get close to filled up. The canister could be a little bit bigger.  I don't think its any louder than any other vacuum cleaner. I could have a conversation with someone while using it.
Great Vac and easy to use and get around the house
Ten years old this week, still works like it did on Day #1  Considering I purchased my DC14 ten years ago this month, in March 2005, and it's still working the same way it did when I bought it, I'd say it's a winner. It's cost me $55.00 a year if you average it out based on original purchase price of $550, and it was worth every penny. I'll buy another Dyson whenever this one decides to crap out on me yet, but I don't worry about that happening, considering I've moved it across the country and back, and it's lived in four different homes with different types of carpeting and flooring in all four of them.t
Great way to clean your floors !  It is worth every penny ! It works on all types of flooring and it has great pick up ! All I can say is this Rocket really sucks ! One of the best sweeper we ever owned for the way it's picks up!
It sucks...in a good way.  I've used Eureka vacuums for years and have always had good luck with them. This one has got to be the best yet. You can use it with or without bags, it has a nifty retractable cord and it basically restored my rug to its original fluffiness. I've read other reviews that mentioned how loud this product is. Obviously those reviewers have never had an actual loud vacuum. I could hear the phone ring with no problem while in use. My dog didn't even try to eat it when I turned it on. There were also complaints about how heavy it is. They must be first time users. It may not be as light as some of the newer fancier products on the market but it wasn't advertised as such either. Another complaint was how cheaply it was made. It's plastic. Not titanium. If you mistreat it, I'm sure it's going to break. But not under normal use. In conclusion, I hate housework but not my Eureka.
It's by far the best hard surface hand vac  I own a residential cleaning business and this is the 2nd time I have purchased this vacuum-I have used all different types and brands over the years and THIS IS THE BEST-You will not be disappointed-the only reason I bought a 2nd one is because I wanted another backup (I have used my first one on a daily basis 2x per day and the motor is still going strong-
Love this  We love this product, our first one died and we immediately bought a new one.  We like the fact that dirty water is not being spread around with a mop and the dirty water is sucked up for easy disposal.  Easy to use.
awesome floor cleaner easy to use really gets the dirt out  this cleaner is amazing. I really thought my hardwood floors were clean but it shoots water into the little cracks cleans between and sucks out all that dust with the water.  it has such good suction that it leaves my floors completely dry.  I did not use the cleaner that came with it because it is scented I just sprayed a little bona on the floor and then used plain warm water in the tank. I wish we could post pictures or links because my dirty water tank was disgusting and full of little particulate that had to come from between the boards in the spaces. (in the winter my boards shrink and I get spaces in a few places)  I had read that the cord was too short but it did not really bother me. You might have to reposition the plug but I have to do that with most vacuums and a longer cord would be cumbersome.  The machine is lightweight and easy to handle.  I did not try it on tile but plan to try it in my laundry room next.  I am completely happy with my purchase.
daughter loves it
wind tunnel  This is a great product.  It picks up cat and dog hair up easily off a carpet and has plenty of power.  Noisy, but most vacuums are.  Consumers Reports likes it and so do I.
I have two boys, three dogs and a cat. Where has this machine been my whole life. I love it! Cleans up so well and solutions smells amazing. I can take the brush apart to clean out the fur and it folds up nicely. I only wish the cord retracted or would stay in place.
The best vacuum ever!!!!!  My fiance and I have a small apt and were tired of sweeping. I purchased this based on the reviews on amazon and price. " THIs is the most powerful vacuum, i have ever used". I can t believe it . I use it only on wood and tile floors though, so I can say how it will work on a carpet. ITs amazing, please don't  hesitate to get it. Its very compact and light weight so easy to move around. The cord has this suction feature that just sucks it up when your done. Awesome! I purchased it two months ago, so I don't have much time with, but its been great. NO more brooms for use.
Louder than expected.
So far this Dyson has been great. It does a fantastic job  So far this Dyson has been great.  It does a fantastic job, and is very easy to manipulate around the floor.  Its so smooth to glide across carpet and hard floors.  Picks up everything and empties easily.
Amazing  This vacuum works great--I have 2 large Maine coon muts that shed profusely, and this product cleans my carpet better than anything else I have used.  No fur stuck in the rug, and the furniture attachment works well too.  Also it is quieter than I had expected.  For the record, I was given this vacuum as a gift. This review is unsolicited.
Mother loves it  Got this as a mother's day gift, she absolutely loves it.  It's light weight and powerful, perfect for hardwood floors.
Works great. The retractable cord is awesome. (Its the little things)
Very good vacuum.
Great vacuum with a great price!
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my new vacuum!
Hoover FloorMate ROCKS!!  We had a older Hoover FloorMate and loved it.  We thought we would like the Rainbow attachment for washing floors as much as the FloorMate, and then we would have only one machine.  So we purchased the attachment, which is three times the cost and it was awful!!!  Sent it back, bought the new version and we are in love again!!!  There is nothing better for hard floors than Hoover FloorMates!
Great suction!  I just love this product. It really pulls the dirt out of the carpet. It is lightweight enough that my 4 year old granddaughter can handle it. I love pushing 1 button for the retractable cord to wind up on its own. Very convenient!
Great cover-up!  Really cute cover for my Dyson D17. I think it is well made. Feels like men's dress shirt material. Really cute way to disguise my vacuum as it never gets put away since it is used daily. The price was a great bargain! Debating about buying one for my carpet shampooer though that does get hidden when not in use. I recommend this item!
Great product
Fantastic little vacuum! Love it!!!!
very good
Good: very strong suction for both floor and hand use. Fairly heavy.
I love it and it cleans very nice and is easy for me to move from room to room,.
Perfect for a household with pets  <div id="video-block-RXZRT6DR32MZZ" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91sWgtlFEvS.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81aPNkFHAWS.png" class="video-slate-img-url">&nbsp;I love this thing! I bought the rubber broom so many reviewers mentioned. It was a magnet for dog fur and the touchless vacuum works with such ease. Its so much better than a dustpan. Sure its pricey but its convenient. I use mine every day and its worth it.
best buy  Excellent product, excellent value, just what we wanted, does what we wanted, no need for other bells and whistles, why pay more?
I love this vacuum! It is easy to maneuver and sucks up everything that isn't nailed down.
Handles all types of flooring & pet hair  I am super impressed with this vacuum. I have tile, hardwood, med & low pile carpet, carpeted stairs, plush rugs, 2 blow-coat-type dogs, 2 long hair cats, 2 parrots and I live on a dirt road. I needed something that picked up pet hair off of everything including the furniture.  Before, I was using a pet hair magnet (squeegee type thing) on the rugs.  No more! This does it all and the house seems to stay cleaner and the carpets and rugs stay "fluffed". I also didn't realize how much of the dirt road was in my carpets. After the first vacuuming, it isn't so bad. The vacuum is quiet and light enough to carry up/down the stairs.  My stairs turn with a landing in the middle so I don't have to prop the canister on the stairs. Not sure it would fit. However, the handle telescopes out quite a bit. I am challenged with my finger touching the controls and turning off the vacuum while vacuuming.
Great purchase  I was extremely pleased with this vacuum! The container is smaller but also workable. We have a dog and it works grest
Best vacuum you'll ever own!
Great Bang For the Buck!  I LOVE it. Was a replacement for an older top-of-the-line Kenmore that died after 10+ years, the Bissell was an immediate improvement. Yes, it lays flat to get under beds, tables, etc. and it cleans as advertised. Yes, the dust bin is a bit small but I'm only vacuuming a living room area rug and a carpeted bedroom, need to empty it at least once during the process. If you're vacuuming an entire carpeted house or apartment, you might find yourself emptying it several times, as you must to maintain consistent cleaning performance. Emptying and cleaning the tank is easy, bottom drops down right into the garbage can and slips right back into the machine. Very well designed and made, although the cord and power switch switch sit low on the machine - switch should be in the handle, but again, for the price it's a minor inconvenience. Also lightweight and easy to maneuver, a major plus for me and the wife.  Great price, great performance, great construction - what's not to love for $65, and it cleaned better than my DOA Kenmore.  HIGHLY recommended, great job Bissell!
Absolutely Amazing!  this machine is something else! I always thought it was ludicrous to pay more than $100 for a vacuum, but this machine makes it all worth it, even thought I got it reconditioned and as a Gold Box purchase. There are a few blemishes on the machine and I had to figure out how to get the machine to stay upright, but otherwise it is like brand new! Living in an apartment, the carpet isn't exactly top quality and it gets treated differently by different people. On top of that I have a longhair cat, so there is hair and dander practically everywhere. The carpet treatment power makes the carpet here look like new, feels like new walking on it. This is well worth the investment of several hundered $$$. I will certainly recommend this to everyone I possibly can.
Great  My housekeeper and I picked this out.  She had been complaining about my old Hoover (25 plus years old).  I was amazed at how much cleaner the carpet looked. I strongly believe in keeping housekeepers happy.  She loves it
Great Little Vacuum  I love my little vacuum!  I've had it for a while now and it's still working flawlessly.  It's easy to maneuver an all the buttons to operate it are in easy reach.  The dust bin is very easy to empty.  And it's so versatile; it would take care of any vacuuming needs in your house!
Great vacuum!  This is such a good vacuum. I had another one just like this that lasted 6 years! I think that is a long time for a vacuum that is used several times a week. It finally gave out after 6 years and we got another one just like it. As before, it is exceeding my expectations. We recently had work done at our house and there was sawdust everywhere. The hose feature with the brush allowed me to easily clean all the surfaces, even the tops and bottoms of picture frames. Great vacuum!
Good Vacuum  Works very well! Very happy with my purchase
Quiet  Have had this vacuum for a couple years now and absolutely LOVE it.  Very quiet!  Can't stand the noise of vacuums, but can tolerate this fine.  Great on the wood floors I have.
Dirt Doesn't Stand a Chance  Vacuums are a commodity item, available in a number of models and configurations from a number of manufacturers but they all have a single task: collect dirt, dust and other detritus to be discarded, leaving a clean surface behind. The Dirt Devil does a magnificent job at its primary task, generating a powerful suction and collecting the dirt in its bagless cup. The cyclone separator maintains this suction even as the dirt and dog hair collects, while the final filter makes sure that the air returned to room doesnt just spread the dirt around once again.  Adjustable for varying flooring heights, the unit works well on carpet and hard surface alike. When it comes time to empty the canister, a quick click of the button releases the bottom dropping the dirt in the waste can. When the filters get dirty it is easy to pull them out, rinse them and replace them. This is an excellent vacuum.   So what separates this unit from the rest of the faceless pack? The onboard hose makes cleaning much more convenient and the combination crevice tool-brush is so well designed and handy (not falling off every time you use the vacuum) that I actually use it. It makes you wonder why no one thought of this before. It generates a powerful suction both on the floor and in the extension tools. It is easy to empty and clean but there are a couple of design points that the next version might want to address. The cord could be a little longer and mounted higher; when the cord exits the base I find that there is a tendency to run it over or get tangled; up high on the handle lets the user manage the cord better.
IF YOU HAVE PETS, THIS IS A GREAT VACUUM  I had been using an upright Electrolux which was supposed to pick up cat and dog hair but didn't.  Did some research on the Miele, and although it's expensive, it's worth it.  It picked up all the dog and cat hair from my wood floors!!!  I'm really happy with my decision to buy it.
Finally, a vacuum for pet owners!  I was amazed at how well this vacuum gets up the pet hairs, not to mention all the other junk in the carpets! I was embarassed the first time I used it, I never knew my old vacuum was that bad. Living on a farm with two very furry dogs, five cats, and two kids, I have to vacuum every day just to be able to survive in my house. We have averaged one vacuum a year, but I really believe this one will survive the abuse of our house. I admit, I was more than hesitant to pay this much for a vacuum, but I think it is worth every penny. Plus it's purple, my favorite color. It handles very well, and has great suction, even with a full canister. My last vacuum had to be emptied at least five or six times during one cleaning session. This one has room to spare, even after I cleaned all the rooms in the house, chased down the dust bunnies under the beds, and cleaned out the cobwebs from the corners. The motorized hand attachment did a wonderful job on the furniture, getting up all of the cat hairs from my Maine Coon's favorite chair. Even my husband and teenage sons will vacuum with it! Now that is amazing! The only thing I can find even remotely bad to say about it is that it is heavy to lug up and down our stairs, but the very long hose and wand will reach to the bottom with no trouble at all. Another plus is the cord, it is long enough to reach around the house without needing to run back and forth to plug it in again, and again, and again. This is the best vacuum I have ever owned, it does a much better job than some of the most expensive brands I have purchsed (You know, the one that sounds like a B-17 taking off, or the one that has the water filter that someone will forget to empty and the whole thing rusts tight, never to be used again). A great investment, that I highly recommend. Great job Dyson!
one of the better ones. Price considered  As advertised... and more!  Have had numerous ones before this.  Price aside, one of the better ones.  Price considered, one of the BEST!  Get one!
Sharks are the best!  I am debating about purchasing my 3rd Shark Navigator, I love them so much!.. My original shark still works, it is at least 6 yrs old but a bolt lost the nut so I use it upstairs and purchased another one for my main floor, one of the ones with all the bells and whistles. It is at least 2-3 yrs old, works like a charm except I don't like it as much as my old shark because it is one of the swivel heads which means I have to concentrate more when I vacuum, to make sure it is going the way I expect it to go.  And to take it apart to use the hoses, I have to stop and think every time how to disconnect.  Needless to say, most of the time when I want to use the hose, I use the old one with the bolt issue, just have to remember to push it back in place every couple of minutes.  So now I am contemplating purchasing a new Shark w/o the swivel head to replace my upstairs basic model.  Oh, and I just purchased a Shark steam mop!  I also love that!  My linoleum is 12 yrs old, still looks good but I can see the ground in dirt.  Plus the floor was sticky from all the product build-up.  It is slowly getting up the grime, I've only used it 3 times but the floor is a whole lot less sticky.  And only water!  No more cleaner.  Needless to say, I love Shark!  They are inexpensive, last a long time, well past the warranties, and do a phenomenal job.
Powerful  After our long time vacuum went belly-up, my wife wanted a light weight vacuum with good power without spending too much. I checked Amazon and read up on the reviews. I learned a long time ago that just because something cost a lot doesn't mean its any better or will last any longer. This Dirt Devil was the number rated vacuum for what I was looking for and well under a hundred dollars. The suction is great, its really light and seems very well made. The only negative is it's noise level... it's very loud. Being our home is all tiled except for area rugs, this vacuum is perfect for what we wanted. For the powerful motor, ease of maneuvering and super low cost, we can live with the noise level it produces.
No buyers remorse!  I am very pleased. Solidly constructed and works like dream. An exceptionally good vac for the money.
I had the older version of this model and pretty much wore it out after years of use  Have had this vac for about a year now, perhaps. I had the older version of this model and pretty much wore it out after years of use. This model is extremely light, maneuverable, powerful and does the job. We have mostly hard flooring, but it's great on the carpet too. Gets cat and bunny fur too. I don't bother getting the more expensive bags that are supposed to help with allergies - they seem no better than the less expensive (though not cheap) filtrete bags at http://www.amazon.com/Miele-Synthetic-Vacuum-Filters-Filtrete/dp/B001HL02Q8/ref=sr_1_5?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1422458806&sr=1-5&keywords=miele+vacuum+bags  It is suggested that you change the bag every month or two. I think we probably do change it every couple of months. The floor tool is lovely because it swivels to fit almost anywhere - though not in very  tight spaces under furniture. I really do like this machine and, from my experience, Miele makes an excellent product. I did quite a bit of research before purchasing this - actually bought and returned a different model first - and this one is the most practical in my book.
Excelente toy
Love it especially cause it has a bag!  I love this product because of its lightweight body and that the canister is seperate.  I also love it because it has a HEPA bag versus a canister that you empty out.  This is my second one.  The only thing I don't like is the "brains" of this vacuum is at the base of the handle that is made of plastic.  Makes it more vulnerable to break and not be able to replace part without it costing the same price as an entire new vacuum!
If you are going back and forth on buying a Shark- buy it! It costs more than any vacuum I've ever purchased, but it was worth it. This has awesome suction, is easy to use and the pet attachments are awesome. It has a long cord so no stopping to find another outlet, which is nice. The only downfall is that with quality, comes the fact that it's a litttle heavy. The swiveling and brushroll feature makes it easy to maneuver though. I will definitely be a Shark customer for a long time.
This works great!
I have had this vacuum cleaner for about three weeks.  I works just as the advertisement said it would.  I picked up carpet fibers that I knew were on the carpet but my old machine would not pick them up.  I am very pleased with the Stark and have nothing bad to say  about it.
I love this vacuum  I love this vacuum. I live in an apartment with two cats, and it picks up after them better than any other vacuum I've used. It isn't so great on the hard surfaces in my kitchen and bathroom, but as far as the carpet and furniture, it's great.
I was most please with its power to clean. The indicator that lights when I'm actually picking up stuff and not just sucking air is a blessing!
Best. Purchase. Ever!  I can't believe that I didn't purchase this earlier. I've always had a Kirby and thought Kirby was the best until I started researching. I have a long hair cat that sheds like crazy and her fur sticks to everything. This literally gets everything up! The first few uses picked up sooo much that the Kirby has missed. It took me two weeks to break down and purchase this and now I wish I would have switched years ago!
I like it.  Good Suction for the money.
So far so good  After using my parents animal Dyson I decided I had to buy one of my own.  While this isn't an animal model, it seems to work just as well as far as I can tell.  I have a husky and he leaves hair EVERYWHERE, and I am ridiculously happy to finally own a vacuum that's so versatile and powerful.  Two of my favorite things about Dysons are the fact that they're bagless (which is earth-friendlier) and the ease with which you can empty the canister.  If it continues to work as well as it has for the first few uses, it may be the best purchase I've ever made!
So happy with the vacuum  So happy with the vacuum. I can actually  push and pull it across my thick carpet! It has been great!
Happy  LOVE this product. Is perfect for our 3 bedroom home w/ a upstairs game room. The stair attachment is amazing too!
Love it!
Execution  We purchased this vacuum cleaner with the hopes that it will outlast the previous vacuum cleaners. Our Dyson is able to keep up with our large family and large dogs. We are amazed at the pet hair it removes and the very fine dirt it picks up. You get what  you pay for. Excellence. You will want to vacuum, just to see the results. Rarely does this vacuum get a clog!!
Super Value!  Excellent backup for your Rainbow!  For of all it's NOT going to rip your vinyl flooring free from the adhesive with a super vacuum .  What it will do is: vacuum pet hair from the floor and carpet, pick up grass clippings dragged in by the dog/cat, enable the vacuum to get under the dinner table and chairs using the flexible handle which avoids additional back pain.  The battery fully charged is good for 20+ minutes with both the vacuum and the powered cleaning brush, after 20 min. power begins to fade.  The removable hand held vacuum is a blessing when you're doing floors and see  a herd of dust bunnies hiding in a corner that the powered vacuum head can't maneuver into, pop the hand held out and help them relocate to the trash can!  Same deal when you spot cookie crumbs in the couch crevices and under cushions. Suck 'em up, reinstall the hand held in the upright vacuum and back to the floor cleaning again.  This is the second one I've had in the past 4 years.  The recently retired unit was beginning to loose suction and I suspect the batteries were 'giving up the ghost'.  Anyway, I really hope Bissell continues to make this model, it's CHEAP, does an excellent job for the cost, and convenience makes it worth every penny.  Enjoy! (hmm, about as much as you can enjoy cleaning house/automobile:)
We use it all the time...love it!  Works great and just as I expected it to, if not better.  Scares the animals every once in a while as they will sometimes push something they are playing with too close.  Funny to see their reactions! We have ours on, but you can switch to a manual button to turn it on when ready.  I never have to use a dustpan and it's super easy to empty.  Kids love to use it too. Glad I purchased it!
Totally Awesome  What a vacuum this is!! We vacuum every week and we did not know how much dirt we missed until we used the Electrolux.  Our old vacuum would only pick up what was laying on top of the carpet and floors.  This vacuum picks up what is in the carpet, such as the fine participles of soil that are ground into the carpet.  In addition used without the carpet brush, it will pick up all the dirt hiding inside the baseboards and woodwork.  It is like a suction dynamo for cleaning wood floors and baseboards.  We have sisal, hemp, wool and nylon rugs and every one of them looks new after using this Electrolux.  We consumer reviewed vacs for three years and I was unsure about purchasing an Electrolux.  Amazon had a good price during Black Friday week, and we had to have a better vac, we were using a hand held to clean the floors.  Since I have dust allergies, I was concerned about getting a bag less vac.  No problems, dust is captured in the vac filters and now that we actually are getting the dirt into the vacuum, I don't have red eyes and a clog nose every morning.
Really Great Vacuum, Great Brush Cleaning Feature.  So my wife has long hair, and it is beautiful hair and I the hair and I love her.  But her long hair has been the end of more than one vacuum cleaner.  As she would brush her hair, or lose a hair here or there is would somehow inevitably end up on our dark carpet where I couldn't see it.  Then I would go and vacuum the carpet in our house and her hair along with it.  Well eventually her hair would surround and wrap itself around the brush roll on our vacuum; essentially making the brush roll useless because it was surrounded in hair.  This caused one brush roll motor to burn out, and on subsequent vacuums I had to manually cut the hair out of the brush roll or just replace them as they became full of hair.  This vacuum has a great feature that fixes that chore.  I am not quite sure how it works but with the press of a button, the brush roll starts turning and the hair and gunk normally surrounding the brush roll gets moved to the center of the roll where it can easily be pulled off or in tough situations cut off.  Greta genius idea, this may not be my vacuum that I own the longest now.  Other than that this vacuum has all the great standard features you would expect.  Push button start and stop.  Push button height control, and a wand and accessories.  You get a standard brush style end for the hose and also one of those spring loaded ends that are useful for cleaning corners and stairs.  This is a push vacuum though, so no motorized action here.  But it is fairly light so I don't mind that.  It is a bagless cyclone style.  Lots of great suction, I have not had any trouble getting it to pick up any debris on my floors yet.  Any I really like this vacuum and really enjoy the brushroll feature.  If you have any questions leave me a comment and I will do my best to try and answer.
Rainbow Vacs the Mercedes of Vacuums  Rainbow vacuums are the elite of vacuums. I've owned a rainbow for over 20 years and I love them. The only issue I have because I am getting older, they are heavy to move around. I recently got brand new plush carpet and my rainbow vacuums this carpet beautifully. My Dyson won't even penatrate the carpet.  Rainbow vacs are pricey but look for one on ebay.com. I found mine used on craigslist.com. And got a super bargain.
This vaccuum really sucks!  LOL! haha! No, I really love it!  Apologies for my little joke, I had to say it! I love this vacuum - it's power its very strong, and it is super easy to use and clean. I have a small room with a bare wood floor to use this on, and it looks today the cleanest I have ever seen it, even with using other vacuums. I would definitely recommend this vacuum. It might not stand up hoever to a huge household or much rough treatment, but I didn't try it for that so I couldn't say.
BIG TIME SAVER!  If you can love a machine, I do! our entire main floor is tile. What a time saver! I read another review; they said the machine didn't take up the water as expected. I've found that once the scrubber brush is saturated, you don't need to keep a steady stream of cleaner going.
Small but Mighty  Great little vacuum. Love how it really sucks up grit in our cabin and is small and lightweight so to allow us to carry it into the rafters for further cleaning of the dust and cobwebs!
Oreck Super Deluxe Vacuum  Excellent canister vacuum. So much more suction that are previous one.
Hoover WindTunnel T-Series Pet Rewind Plus Upright Vacuum Bagless  Great little vacuum! Love that I don't have to replace the bags all the time. Does really well with our 3 cat and 2 child household. First time I used it I could not believe all the dust and hair that this little vacuum got up! My husband isn't sneezing anymore in the house as the filters and ability to pick up all that causes the dust is gotten with this model. Highly recommend.
This Shark vacuum has a lot of attachments and tremendous suction!  This little guy could probably suck the paint off of the walls! My wife fell in love with it the first time she used it several months ago. The love affair continues!
Dirt devil  Ok yes its loud  but we have had every other vaccum under 400 bucks out there and this one works my mom vaccums 3 or more times a day every days and it still holds up  the others lasted a year or less this one is going on...I think 3 years now .. do who cares if its a little loud It not a lexus .. so if you want clean carpets  Buy this ..Simple to use Cheap and no need for bags or filters .. Throw the filter in th dyer once a week for 5 misn  and its as good as new
Vacuuming is a dream  I am a cleaning freek and I adore my new hoover self propelled bagless vacuum. OMG it sucks like a bandit. The floor shakes with power to pick up dirt. I Love It. Janis in The Villages, Florida
This isour third  wind tunnel and they just keep getting better.  I tried a Dyson and it wasn't nearly as good at picking up dirt and it cost a lot more.
Hoover Rermanufactured Self Propelled........a Good deal  A minimum assembly required........two screws.  Quite heavy, but self propell feature is great.  I call it 'the brute'  Well worth the $99....freight included.
This vacuum sucks up dirt like nothing=very powerful,I really love this amazing,Eureka!!!
Just sucks up the dirt.  Much better than my last vacumn and lightweight.
great suction  This is the first vacuum I've had that actually has enough suction so that the small rotating brush attachment works!  It does a wonderful job on carpeted stairs and everything eles. The adjustable suction is fabulous! Use low to clean lampshades etc and high for all the pet hair.  Goes effortlessly from wood floors to carpet and does great on both.  No dusty smell left after vacuuming.
for the price yes  I have purchased two of these vacuums. One for me and one for my son, we both love them. good strong vacuum, I had a Orik vacuum before i paid well over $ 500 dollars for it,it was lite but it did not do the job that this can do and does do. I'm very happy with my purchase.
EXACTLY as described! EXCELLENT quality! VERY pleased! It is SO MUCH BETTER than the Bissell steam mop!  EXACTLY as described! EXCELLENT quality! VERY pleased! It is SO MUCH BETTER than the Bissell steam mop!
A great vac for hardwood or tile flooring.
Vacuum of my dreams!!!  I dreamed about small, flexible and powerful vacuum. And I found it. It's Dyson DC39. I used it very often during one year and I never was upset about my buying. Suggest everyone this vacuum.
My 3rd FloorMate.  It is my 3rd FloorMate. The old one was not worth repair. Hoover keeps improving style and function... Prefect!  Large capacity water and waste water tank. Just what I need.  However, the cleaning head is on the small size compared to my earlier models. Though more compact, it cleans much better.
"This Vacuum Rocks!!"  So after 8 years my hoover vacuum bit the dust.  I actually don't do most of the vacuuming, my boyfriend does.  So i researched for the best vacuum with all of his requirements:  1. Must be bagless.  "I hate fumbling with those stupid bags." 2. Must be upright. "I don't want to be dragging half the machine behind me" 3. Must have cleaning tools.  "I have to get under the tables and the baseboard too, it gets gross!"  This one met all of his requirements; bagless, upright, 4 tools.  And it met mine: Must be reasonably priced.  We went to our local Target and bought it, not ten minutes after we were home my boyfriend had it out of the box and was going nuts on our apartment. It was honestly hilarious, every minute he's scream out something like, "This light is awesome babe!!" "Oh my god, babe! check out this turbo brush!"  "This thing has so much suction!! Look at the crap I pulled out of the carpet"  "Oh man, this vacuum rocks!!"  We've only had it for a day but my entire apartment has been vacuumed not once, but twice because he had to move all the furniture to vacuum underneath it.  I love this vacuum because my boyfriend loves it.  You swear he was five-years-old and I bought him the newest, coolest, most awesomest toy ever.  Best purchase ever.
nice upgrade from my dc07  The DC33 is a solid, attractive upgrade from my first-gen Dyson (dc07), it works better, weighs less, and generally seems robust.  A lot of reviews here discuss the DC33 as the owner's first Dyson or versus other brands, so I'll focus on comparing it to my retired DC07, which failed after 8 years of hard use.  Comparisons:  * The DC33 has the same kind of head as the DC07, which makes it possible to roll over (and pick up) small things like cat food kibble or peanuts, and to go over bumps in the flooring.  I passed up the DC40 because it has a "floating" head that adjusts to the floor under it, and reviews said that it had trouble picking up small objects as a result.  * The DC33 is a little shorter, and notably lighter the the DC07.  * The DC33's motor sounds a little higher pitched.  * The DC33's bin is a little smaller (in height), and the contents don't swirl around when not full, like they did in the DC07.  The collected dust/dirt seems more compacted.  The bin design and release mechanisms are different now.  * The DC33 brushbar seems to raise my carpet's pile more readily and gets into the carpet better (even when the DC07 was new, I had to make multiple passes over areas where the pile rose in different directions because of the carpet installation).  * The DC33's included attachments are a bit underwhelming.  The "Animal" cleaners come with better attachments, but it's much cheaper to just buy the basic vac and buy the attachment you need separately.  * There are now 2 filters to wash/clean periodically.  * The DC33's warranty (5yrs) is longer than the DC07 initially came with.  * All the DC33 hardware and connections seems as sturdy as before, or sturdier.  Even the power cable is a little heavier.  * I seem to pick up as much (or more) dirt in fewer passes with the DC33, than when my DC07 was new.  After a few sessions, I'm very pleased with my DC33 so far.  I'll update the review if the situation changes.  Highly recommended.  Update July 2013: Still very happy with the DC33 after 5 months of weekly vacuuming the entire house (lots of cat hair).
Great vacuum  Great vacuum
I would highly recommend this vacuum to other pet parents  I own a double-coated Bernese Mountain Dog, and I can't say enough about this vacuum; it's very effective at sucking up all of my girl's dog hair.  I use this vacuum about twice a week.  And, the attachments that come with the vacuum are very effective.  I had my eyes on this vacuum for quite a while and I was thrilled to get this vacuum for $186 during Black Friday.  I would highly recommend this vacuum to other pet parents.
Great for pet hair  I use mine daily in high traffic areas like in front of the doggie door. I love that is cordless and so easy to use. The suction is good, I just wish it held more so it doesn't have to be emptied so often.
Arrived on time and wife loves it! It is nicer than expected.
... was a little hard to assemble but it works great and it is easy to work  it was a little hard to assemble but it works great and it is easy to work.
Excellent vacuum - great deal for the money  I bought this vacuum cleaner to use while I was living in a temporary apartment -- thinking it was cheap and wouldn't last long -- especially the rewind feature. WRONG!  This is a really good vacuum cleaner.  It cleans well, it is easy to empty, and the cord rewinder works!  I'm ordering a second one to give to my recent college grad -- for use in his first apartment.
Love this vacuum works awesome!!
Love this Vacuum!!!  I love this Vacuum! Light weight, and really has great suction! I relatives that have this vacuum, and that is why I bought it. They love it too!
Love Our New Vacuum Cleaner!  We were looking for a vacuum cleaner we could use on both our wood floors and our large area rugs, and this Bissell is perfect for both jobs.  It's easy to push around the house and that's a biggie for me.  Plus, it's so easy to empty the dirt cup!  I never feel I get all the dust and pet hair off our wood floors just by sweeping but with our new Bissell I can walk barefoot across our floors and feel nothing but clean surfaces.  Next we're getting Bissel's steam vac as I'm totally sold on this brand now.  Can't say enough good things about it!
Amazing, very strong vac, ans easy to clean
Well worth it!  I have an 885 sq ft apartment, and I had to empty the canister twice before I was done vacuuming.  Nothing about the performance or look indicated that it was a refurb.  Well worth it, especially since it's so much cheaper than buying it new!
Love this vacuum  Love this vacuum. Bought it because my new house has a lot of tile and hardwood. Does a great job. Easy to use and light weight.
I ordered the for my daughter and she loves it
a good deal good product  more power than others it's size, easy to empty but quite "lightweight" in constructx so it may not last 4-ever but whatta price !
Love it. Best little vac I even owned. I bought 2
GREAT vacuum!!!  LOVE this vacuum!  It is the best one I've owned so far!  Suction is super and so easy to use. It is not as lightweight as some but I really like it a lot!
I had never owned a dyson before this one.  I am impressed.
Mighty "Mighty Mite"  In 2002, at a garage sale I bought a used little red Eureka Mighty Mite for use in our car, we had no idea how old it was at the time, however soon it became the familys main vacuume, best we have ever had.  In 2012 it sadly expired from age and overuse.  We just had to have another Mighty Mite(new), the one we received from our order is every bit as good as the one we were replacing, we hope it gives us as many years of service.
This is a terrific little vacuum cleaner!  Well suited for a small apartment or dorm room. It has good power and picks up well. The lights really help you see those dust bunnies! Works very well on stairs due to its smaller size and weight. Removing and using the hand held vacuum is the best part. Use it for table tops or other hard to reach areas.
Great vacuum  I reviewed several vacuums before buying this one. We have had it almost a month and love it. Its great to have a bagged vacuum again. We had a bagless one before this one and it works so much better. My wife used it the first day and the carpet has never looked better. She loves the on/off feature for hardwood flooring. I would suggest this to anyone looking for a good price vacuum.
Best little vacuum!  I did not expect this little vacuum to have such great suction power!  I am very please and should have bought 2!!
Great vacuum  We bought this vacuum for our flat which is mostly carpeted with a few wood an tile floors in the bathroom and hall.  The head is great for the carpet, as the revolving head stirs up any hair or other walked in crumbs and then just sucks them away. Since the vacuum doesn't need any bags it is very clean and handy to use, I simply empty the container at the end into the bin and be done with it.  The wheels allow very easy maneuvering and it is indeed able to get around corners easier since the vacuum is smaller than your standard monster of a unit. The retractable head is very handy and is easily adjustable in length and when finished can just be mounted onto the base of the vacuum and then stored away without taking up a lot of room.
LOVE IT!!  Assembly is a breeze, suction is outstanding, the telescopic wand is not plastic but metal so it's very durable.  The reach with the wand is unreal, no more getting up on stool/ladders to get to the tops of the cabinets.  Lightweight and convenient, even comes with a Hepa filter, this product has more power and flexibility than any upright I have ever owned!!!  And the price here is the best you'll find!!!  I also saved $45 plus S&H by buying it here than at BB&B!!!  I love it!!!
I gave this to my 29 year old daughter and she is in love with it  I bought this for myself and found this one a bit to big and heavy.  I gave this to my 29 year old daughter and she is in love with it!!! She has a dog that sheds and she says this was the best thing ever!!! I bought myself a smaller one and I am also in love... lol
Best vacuum ever  Best vacuum I have ever owned.  And at age  73 I have owned lots of vacuums
Great vacuum!  I bought this vacuum to replace a similar Bissell upright that I had used almost daily for 7-8 years.  This model is even better!  I couldn't believe all the pet hair and dirt that it collected in one use, especially since I constantly clean the floors and carpets.  This vacuum is powerful without being cumbersome.  It is easy to maneuver, adjust settings, and empty.  My favorite feature is the Brush On/Off Switch, located at the top of the canister.  It makes switching from carpet to hard floor a breeze.  Another great feature is the soft rubber guard around the front that cushions any contact with furniture or walls, preventing scratches or damage. I am a Bissell fan!!
easy to use
Amazing vacuum  I was searching for a new vacuum for several months, and came across this one, read ALL the reviews and thought I'd take a chance...it sounded too good to be true.  When I received it, it was just amazing.  It is truly the best vacuum I have ever owned.  The suction power is great.  My kids and I had so much fun with it (because it worked so well), we vacuumed the whole house, including the furniture, fans, etc.  the first day.  I would recommend this vacuum to anyone that wants a great one!
Love It  I just got new hardwood floors after having carpet all my (adult) life. I could not figure out an efficient way to clean my lovely floors. This vacuum solved my problem. It has "velvet" covered wheels and vacuum head  (so it won't scratch the floors), adjustable suction levels, and various attachments. The attachment head makes very good contact/seal with the floor.  In fact, I had to back off the suction level because it became difficult to move (kind of got stuck) As the name of the product implies, it is the "Hard Floor Expert", and as such, it's performance on carpet is marginal. I use my regular upright vacuum on my carpet and rugs.
Very nice, powerful cleaner. Quick delivery, quietest Bissell yet  Quieter than my last Bissell. Bought from Amazon, fulfilled by Warehouse Deals and obviously has been owned by a few people but not ever used  as a  floor cleaner. Two different UPS labels on a beat-up box but the vacuum is complete and works well. Cleaned a rug previously cleaned with a Kirby and a tablespoon of pet hair and dust  was removed so its power is better than a Kirby. Did not have a manual or warantee card but  was quickly downloaded from the internet. Certainly well worth $100 for a $170 full priced machine. Ordered  a SquareTrade warantee for 3 years for $30. The dust and filter containers have poorly designed  plastic hinges that look to me as  points  of breakage....not a case of will but when. Attachment hose very tight and very difficult  to try to extend and clean surfaces.
best vacuum I've ever owned.
Easy to use and awesome considering the price!
Worth every penny LOVE it!!!!  I absolutely love this vacuum!!! I've purchased vacuum after vacuum and nothing even comes close to this one. Worth ever penny of the purchased price. Easy to assemble. Makes cleaning the entire house an easy task with all of the attachments and lift away canister.
Can't say enough about this vacuum.  Purchase this and be done with it.
it sucks and has for years!!
light weight yet powerful.
BEST!!!!  Cleaned very well!!
Great vacuum cleaner for an even greater price!!!!  I have had this for a little over two months now. This is a fantastic vacuum cleaner. Its first job was to clean up needles from my CHRISTmas tree and it didn't leave a thing behind. Picked them all up without having to empty the canister, thought I did empty after being done with the needles. I have several grandkids that love to help grandpa vacuum and this one makes it easy for them. The self propelled upholstery cleaner works better than any other I have ever used. Only complaint is that it is advertised as light weight, it is most definitely not light weight, but that is a minor point as I don't find myself having to  lift it up for much of any reason. This is a vacuum cleaner that I would recommend and have done so already, especially for the job it does at the value that the vacuum cleaner is. Very well built.
Nice and light, compact and works well.
best vacuum we've had...exceptional customer service  We've had our Dyson for 3 years now.  As advertised, this vacuum cleaner has not lost suction.  It's a very powerful cleaner, and has caused us no problems.  Overall, the Dyson is an exceptional value.  We did have a minor part break, separating the hose from the telescoping handle.  It is plastic, and not as sturdy as some of the higher end cleaners.  We called the customer service line to find a replacement part, expecting to pay since the cleaner was no longer under warranty.  The customer service rep noticed that we'd moved since purchasing it, and asked if we were military.  In the end Dyson gave us the part for free as "thanks" for serving...said that was their policy.  Gotta give the foks at Dyson kudos on that deal.
Review of Bissell Lift Off 2-in1 pet cordless stick vacuum  This Bissell Lift Off stick vacuum is better than advertised. I live in a large home with original repurposed hardwood floors throughout. I have two cats and a black lab so pet hair and feeding, and litter box areas are an issue. I also have oriental area rugs in several places. This unit is replacing a ten year old Bissell corded model. My Mother called it an electric broom. The performance of this cordless model is as good and even better than the more powerful corded model. The rotating beater bar is a definite huge bonus and being able to turn the bar on and off with the flick of a switch is awesome. I figured I would be sacrificing suction power with this cordless model but I was wrong. The suction is very good and simply keeping the filter clean with each use ensures this feature. With my old corded model cleaning litter areas was often quite the chore. But not with this new model. The detachable dust buster is yet another great feature. I have read other reviews saying they added backup filters but I find that if it is cleaned with mild nylon utility brush and rinsed with warm water and some Dawn one filter suits me fine. It is always dry by the next time cleanup is needed. Cleaning the filter super easy and the rest of the switches on the unit are convenient and sensible. I will never go back to the corded model. Its headed to Goodwill. Charging is easy and run time is consistent with factory specs. I purchased a couple more for Christmas presents. We are all pet lovers and have hardwood or tile floors making this cordless vacuum a wonderful tool. It does very well on thin pile carpets also and even does a pretty good job on thicker pile carpets in the bedrooms in between heavy cleaning with a regular vacuum. I strongly recommend this unit to anyone I love it!!!
Excellent product!  Just what we were looking for . . . and better!
Great vacuum! Suction is good and easy to push  Great vacuum! Suction is good and easy to push. I had a eureka for 7 years until I had to buy a new one. This is a great replacement.
I now LOVE to vacuum!!  I was looking for a vacuum that had strong enough suction to pick up small items and hair off my carpets. After reading several reviews I decided to order and I love it! This vacuum picks up more than I ever even knew my old vacuum was missing...I know enjoy vacuuming cause I only have to go over an area once and the vacuum picks up any dirt/hair. Very easy to assemble and use right out the box.
I Love my Windtunnel vacuum!  I had been searching for a new vacuum for a while when my neighbor let me borrow her Windtunnel. I really liked it, so I did a review search on it. The Windtunnel  is the only one that I looked at that had only one bad review. And his problem was the noise it made. This vacuum is WAY more quiet than my old one, so that was not a problem for me! I Love it, it has amazing suction and with the self propel my children can even help me vacuum! Mine was also a remanufactured vacuum so I wasn't sure how it would look, but it looked Brand New! I also bought an extension hose, which several people suggested. I think it is a must, the regular hose isn't very long so you have to pull the vaccum around with you. With the extension I can vacuum my stairs with the base at the bottom, so now there is no more dragging the vacuum down one stair at a time!
Great vacuum  My old Miele had to go in for repairs to the power cord, so I got this as a replacement. I didn't think they could possibly improve on my old one, but they did. Though the power brush is heavy, it's highly maneuverable, and the height adjustment pedals make it work for all my floors, rugs, and deep pile carpets. The dust bag is very large, and it vacuums all of my heavy shedding dog's white hairs off the dark navy wool rug so that there's not a single strand left!
Phenomenal!  I am IN LOVE with this purchase! I honestly have gone through many sweepers in my lifetime, but this one is phenomenal.
Best suction on vacuum I've ever used - 3 cat home  This Dyson vacuum [DC28-Animal] now in use three months, has replaced a top-of-the-line Miele Blue Moon canister AND monthly maid service!  On the first use I filled the container four times [2 bedroom home] with all the bits, dirt, and cat hair that neither the Miele nor the maid service had picked up. [...easier to maintain after the first deep cleaning.]  I am not sure what else I can say in praise better than that!  The setup was intuitive and easy with the included pictographs.  The tools are all quick to add and remove.  cons:  The included crevass tool is too big, with no narrow tip for getting deep between seat cushions. No included hard floor tool with bristles. [The included flat head floor tool or the unit itself with brushes off still feels a bit wrong on wood and tile flooring after so many years using a brush tool.]  The cord is not self-winding takeup, however it is quick-release. Only two tools can travel on-board.  pros:  ease of use, an extra-long cord gets to more area with few stops to change wall plugs! easy to empty larger cannister [than other Dyson models] with one-click open, TERRIFIC suction, very-good suction powered upholstery tool, 2 hepa filters that are cleaned, NOT replaced [save a bundle here annually]! tools that work, the flat head floor tool is clearly superior under furniture with little clearance, easier to store than canister, 5-year warranty shows they stand behind their product
Second we owned works great Thank You
I am absolutely in love with this vacuum  I am absolutely in love with this vacuum. For the price and size it works perfectly for my needs. I have a smaller house but two medium sized dogs that shed like crazy on wood and carpet flooring. This cleaned up their hair really well and I love the lift away feature. Im 7 mo the pregnant and its lightweight enough for me to maneuver easily! I would suggest anyone with a smaller living space getting this model.
FAN-damn-TASTIC  best vac ever!  especially living w/ constantly shedding furry critters...also best price found in my research...you won't regret getting it...enjoy!
Works Great  Our Sears "top rated" vacuum cleaner broke after 3 years.  After reviewing Consumer Reports,they again suggested Sears, I decided it was time to do more independent research than Consumers Reports based on my feelings that a VC should last longer then 3 years.  After a lot of research I purchased the DYSON, CR didn't rate the Dyson real well but I went and purchased the cleaner based on reviews from Amazon.  The Vacuum cleaner does an outstanding job!  We had finished cleaning the 2nd floor when the Sears cleaner broke.  We went out and purchased the DYSON and it found dirt the Sears obviously missed.  The carpets look brand new again.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  Please note, I have no affiliation with DYSON.
A beast.  This is an older Dyson. Maybe one or two generations behind. It's still compatible with the new tools and attachments out there. Since it's older you can score these for a steal. I found mine for $100. I'm not sure how it stacks compared to other Dysons, but compared to any other competitor, this vacuum beats them all out. Very versatile, insanely powerful, and well thought out. Everything clicks into place, and no feature hasn't been thoroughly designed. My only complaint: it's so powerful, that using the hand tools and attachments with the hose and wand can be tiresome. The vacuum is sucking against you when you use the hand tools, and so you need some strength to maneuver the attachments. The extending wand takes a minute to adjust to, but is useful for ceiling fans.
We love this vacuum cleaner  This is a replacement vacuum cleaner. We love this vacuum cleaner. It does a great job and the price is impossible to beat.
great vacuum  its little, but its powerful! Easy to clean & easy to get out build up of my dogs hair (Alaskan malamute, so LOTS of hair). Definitely glad I purchased this vacuum.
Is It Worth It?  So here's the thing: I've owned a lot of vacuums. A LOT. And until a couple of years ago, there was no contest: My Dyson DC25 Animal was by far the best vacuum I'd ever owned. It met an untimely demise when I unknowingly used it to suck up asbestos dust. After that, I owned two Hoover WindTunnels, and what I found was that Hoover was closing the gap... their newer model WindTunnels were really excellent vacuums. One of them, the Hoover WindTunnel Max Pet Plus, even added a long, retractable cord-- something I'd always wanted on my Dyson.  Where the WindTunnel still lagged behind was primarily in maneuverability-- it was heavier and harder to push around, versus the Dyson ball vacuums, which are a breeze. But I honestly felt worried about Dyson, because I wasn't sure that would be enough to save its dominance, considering the price difference.  Well, if these two brands aren't making the case for capitalism...! Both of them are making major strides. This DC65 is a great improvement over the DC25, which I frankly didn't think was possible. It was a near-perfect vacuum as it was. But this one seriously rocks.  Okay, the improvements:  -EVEN BETTER SUCTION.  They say it sucks up 25% more and I believe it. I had just vacuumed (and thought I'd done a fine job) when I ran the DC65 only because my daughter had spilled some candy. I thought I was just going to do a little spot clean-up, but instead started seeing the dust in the canister right away and decided to run it across the room. I couldn't believe how much it picked up.  -MORE POWER.  It's even more maneuverable now. The DC25 and the DC65 weigh about the same (16 versus 17 pounds), but the added power to the brush bar makes this thing feel like it's self-propelled. It takes no effort whatsoever to push it around.  -SUCTION ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE HEAD.  The suction now goes end to end across the head, which is a real pleasure when you're trying to get into corners, under cabinets, the bottom of couches, etc. It saves you from having to switch to the wand much of the time.  -MORE ATTACHMENTS  There are new and pretty cool attachments for stairs, ceiling fans, blinds, etc. You can't fit all the attachments on the vacuum at once, which is why it comes with a storage bag.  -LONGER CORD  This one is 35 feet, whereas the DC25 was 24.6 feet. Sure helps if you're trying to vacuum a long space without having to unplug and replug.  The single thing they've changed that I *don't* like is the cap on top of the wand... it was a closed cap before, and now it's an open slotted cap. When you put the vacuum in the upright position, it automatically switches to power the wand... and because the cap is open, that means it just starts sucking whatever's in the air there. I don't like that that's usually my hand... so it tries to suck my hand in. Not a huge deal, but an annoyance.  Aside from that, the only other fault I can find is WHO THOUGHT A RED HANDLE WOULD GO WELL WITH A FUCHSIA CANISTER TOP? ;) I adore the fuchsia. The red really, really clashes with it. It's a gorgeous vacuum other than that. Even my 7-year-old says so.  So is this vacuum worth the price? Yes, I'd say it is. If you can swing it, this is the ultimate in vacuum luxury! It will make your job easier and quicker for years to come.  And a side note about assembly: The instructions included a link to watch an online video about assembly, but the link was broken. I just went to YouTube instead and typed in the model number. Voila. Not the greatest video, but still easy to figure out.
Hoover Floormate Spinscrub  It does a good job and is easy to use.  I can't believe how black the water is after cleaning the floor!  I ordered from Amazon and the delivery was quick.
Perfect  I moved from a large home with central vac to a smaller townhouse, with all wood and tile floors. I bought the Miele after reading the reviews, and am extremely pleased. It is light-weight, but does a great job of cleaning. I bought the optional head for wood floors, and really like the flexibility of how it turns and tilts for cleaning. I can even run it along the baseboards quite easily. Going up and downstairs while using this is a breeze. It does ok on the area rugs, but has to be angled in such a way that is not difficult to push back and forth. Just a little trick I learned after struggling with it the first few times.  The bag and filters do a very good job of not releasing dust back into the room. The machine is quiet. The accessories that were included don't seem to want to stay on, so I took them off and leave them in the closet. Overall, I think this was a great purchase and will last me a very long time.
this is going to be great! No more sweeping the floor first then mopping  Just bought it today, this is going to be great! No more sweeping the floor first then mopping.  It cleaned amazingly, in fact I'm ashamed how dirty the floors were.  It was so easy to use and just rinse and dry a few pieces after.  Hope it last a long time!
Dyson DC24 Ball All-Floors Upright Vacuum Cleaner  I was torn about buying this vacuum because there were some negative comments about cord length, canister size, etc.  But now I think those who criticized it may have used it in the wrong environment (i.e, huge houses with large rooms).  I think it is perfect for an apartment, basement, or room cleaning for the average sized rooms that many of us have.  The cord is plenty long (more would be in the way) and I cannot say enough about its suction---phenomenal!! Its light weight makes it easy to transport. It is quiet and I'm now convinced that it is really the top of the line.  I suggest that if you want the best in a smaller sized vacuum, this is the way to go.
Great suction and lightweight.  Easy to use.  Love this product.
Liked it so much I bought one for my daughter  I wanted a vacuum for both carpet and wood floors which used bags.  The Hoover Platinum really filled the bill.  Liked it so much I bought one for my daughter!
Had the previous version of this vacuum & loved it. Hoover has improved on the model greatly & I love this new version. My only compliant was that some of the paperwork included in the instructions left me initially thinking that I was missing parts, but I wasn't. Works extremely well if you need to pick up pet hair.
The Ultimate Guy Vacuum  I'm a dude. I don't like to vacuum. I'm the guy who lets the dishes sit out far too long on the kitchen counter and leave the 99% empty orange juice bottle in the fridge hoping a new one will magically appear.  I live in a condo, which is 90% hardwood floors but I do have a small rug in the middle of living room. I also have a dog, who loves to shed and roll around on that carpet. I needed a vacuum to deal with the rug and with hardwood floors. I read the other reviews and it seemed to fit the bill, but I was kind of worried about the expense of it and if it would be good for both carpets and hardwood floors.  It was. Plus its, dare I say - fun. The roller ball is pretty cool, this thing is like the Mazerati of vacuum cleaners. Also I really should have taken a before and after picture of my rug. This Dyson completely owned it. Dog hair, gone. Seriously like night and day with the difference. I was able to change the vacuum settings from rug to hardwood and used the little arm attachment to clean the corners.  My bachelor pad still looks like a bachelor pad - just a lot cleaner thanks to my Dyson. Plus, it is real compact to store, so it was easy to put away. Oh, and cleaning the canister is beyond easy. Click, disconnect, open trash can, hit another button and dump it out. It really doesn't get any easier than this. I kind-of-sort-of wish that this didn't cost so much, but I really have no complaints over this aside from that.
This is my dream vacuum and I LOVE IT! I vacuum all the time now because of the ease of this particular vacuum.
Eureka 3670G Mighty Mite Vacuum.  Great for vacuuming wood floors,garage floor,inside of cars.......All the pros from other reviewers are in general true and I can't find any negative serious enough to report. Recommended.
nice vacuum  it`s very nice vacuum, it`s quiet, powerful, easy maneuver. and it`s german product- very qualify, i am not disappointed in that.
Great floor cleaner! Highly recommend
Great Value for its impressive performance  True HEPA filtration and Bagless are great features for a home-used vacuum at this price.  Its performance is much more satisfiable comparing to the Bissell (bagless & 3 stages filtration) that I had before.  However, Eureka 5740A is quite heavy and big, which may not be suitable for stair, upper place and ceiling cleaning.  In sum, its overall cleaning power is great and worth its cost.
Solid sucker!  Just got mine today. First pass over my rug was amazing. My old one missed tons! Feels solidly built. Rolls nicely with little effort. Very quiet. Did ok on hard floors on lowest setting but sometimes kicks dirt out the back. Love the cord reminder and the washable filter! Great vacuum for the price! Feels like it would have been much more expensive.
Great vacuum for the price  We mainly use it on hardwood floors and it gets the job done.  For the low cost, you can't go wrong.  We've had this for about a month now and so far no problems.  Highly recommend it.
Good: Filter is very easy to clean  Good: Filter is very easy to clean. Good suction when compare to other vacuum of its size or even bigger. Light weight, compact design and not a bad looking machine:) Bad: Steering the vacuum is a little tricky as it does not drive in a vertical line - it some how feel like the drive is slanted.  Also due to the compact design; setting up the combination tools (e.g. the 12" extension wand & crevice) can be a little tricky, however after few use, you get use to the setup. Overall: You will not be disappointed with this buy.
Awesome vacuum  This is smaller than I thought and at first went oh boy this is not going to work.  I was so wrong this little vacuum has so much power I cannot believe it and it picks up everything.  I like the additional parts and how it is set up and when you turn it on it is so quite.  I think it's a winner and I use it almost daily and hope it last a long long time.  We shall see !
new brush and box in perfect condition.  I'm moving, so I didn't really tried it yet for a long time but what I can tell is that I got it from Vaccum warehouse as refurbished and except for a small scratch ( 1 inch ) on the handle,everything looks new to me. The package arrived completed with all the accessories, new brush and box in perfect condition.
Just what we need  Upright vacuum works perfect, rotary brush is superb.  Feels solid with high quality parts.  Very nice looking also.  Not that loud, though my little girl is still scared of the sound it makes.  Not sure why there is a low speed, maybe for solid floors.  Small hand-held vacuum is perfect for hard to reach areas and for ceiling fans.  The hand-held is pretty loud.  Very happy with the quality.  Both units are pretty light weight.
Best Ever  Well, I just finished the first pass of my home with this new Bissell.  All I can say is I was AMAZED at what this machine pulled out of my carpets.  Now, granted the fact that my Kenmore died about a month ago and I have been just getting by with an old Hoover Canister; however, this thing would suck the kernels off an ear of corn.  Fantastic power & relatively quiet for all it does.  Yes, be prepared to empty the collection canister frequently, but just looking in it will give you an overwhelming sense of accomplishment.  It may also convince you that you are not going to make the cover of Good Housekeeping.  Does a number on pet hair and my carpets almost look like they were shampooed.  The Red/Green light is actually a cool gadget and pretty effective.  I assume that my next pass around the house will not yield the same amount of dirt now that I am in "Green Light" status.  Bottom-line: You cannot beat the quality & performance of this vacuum for this price.
Lite, good, vaccum  This works good on my floors. NO BAGS, save money and time,  It does take time to empty and clean it out almost every time.  No big deal for me.  When clean it works Great.
Just disgusting!!!  What can I say, after owning a DD vibe for about 12 months I decided to give the Shark UV410 a try. I vacuum religiously and always thought I had a clean carpet, in fact the same day I brought home the shark I used the DD to vacuum. After picking up the Shark, I wanted to give it a quick test. I was expecting the container to be fairly empty but to my surprised the vac picked up dirt that my old DD missed. I filled up half the container, and my carpet has never looked better. I also really like the swivel, makes vacuuming a lot easier and faster. I couldn't be more pleased with this product.
Finally one that works
Great Vacuum!  Really happy with my purchase! Works perfectly and was easy to assemble!
Works great  We've had this unit for almost 2 years now and it still works as well as the first day we got it.  This machine just keeps the carpets clean even with 4 little hairy dogs running around the house.  This unit just picks up dirt and hair extremely well.  It is well built and sturdy. We have been using it at least once a week to clean the whole and cars and so far, no issues.  We have tried two other brands before finally making a decision on this expensive purchase but it was well worth it.  I wish we went straight to Dyson because even though the other vacuums were less than a third of the price of this unit, we had to get rid of them anyway, losing over $200 in the process.
No smell...  We have three dogs, so it's used once or twice a day. My favorite attribute is that it doesn't smell bad, as often happens with vacuum cleaners and pets.
A Vacuum made out of 100% pure AWESOMENESS!  After 14 years of needing a good vacuum cleaner, I've FINALLY found one!  I've gone through about 5 vacuum cleaners over those years and have experienced nothing but frustration with every one of them.  Probably becuase they were all cheap.  My husband & I starting looking at a Dyson.  Reading reviews and inspecting it carefully, we decided it was time to get one and WOW!!!!!  I LOVE THIS VACUUM CLEANER!  I love to vacuum now!  It cleans the way a vacuum should clean.  I decided on the canister instead of the upright, just because I'll use it to clean out my vehicles too.  This really is an awesome vacuum!  THANK YOU DYSON!!!!
Best. Vacuum. Ever.  Wow. Just...wow. Seriously, I was embarrassed by the amount of pet hair and dirt in my carpet after using this vacuum for the first time, and this was after using a Kirby for a few months on loan from a friend. Great sucking power, easy to handle, accessories will actually be utilized. Happy Customer, overall :-)
... to replace our Dyson and we couldn't be more happy. This thing has some major suction power  Bought to replace our Dyson and we couldn't be more happy. This thing has some major suction power.
Does its job well.  Bought a new one during Black Friday and didn't even realize it was the same as one I already have. The old one is now used on the porch and the new one on my new rugs. Works well for me.
This is the greatest vacuum cleaner  This is the greatest vacuum cleaner!  We have a spaniel that sheds white fur all over our area rugs.  I went to Target and bought a $175 Hoover pet vacuum, but it didn't pick up anything.  After reading the reviews on this Bissell, I thought I should give it a try.  I was not disappointed.  It immediately picked up the hair and now our rug looks brand new.  Thank you, Bissell!
Excellant  investment  I would highly recommend the Dyson!! This machine is worth every penny. I cannot even begin to describe its cleaning abilities. I have tried a number of other popular vacum cleaners & none of them can even come close to the Dyson's performance. It just sucks the dirt out & yes I did do see a lot of dust in the canister  the first couple  of times inspite of me vacuming my home twice a week with the older vacum before I bought the Dyson. Its suction is simply great , the hepa filter is a great and  technology is what sets it apart from other vacums . Best of all it can  also clean on bare floors and not spread the dirt & tiny objects all over (other vacums spread the  particles and tiny objects all over the floor especially towards the back of the vacum cleaner). In addition, it is not heavy or unwieldy & is easy to manouver all over the place due to the rolling balls. For the sceptics out there, don't know what they are grumbling about. It is simply the best on the market.
This is a good one!  After years of buying Kenmore vacuums, I finally got smart and bought this Miele.  It is lightweight and easy to carry, with strong quiet suction.  I expect many years of superior performance.
I have used a few different carpet cleaning machines, from rented ones to home machines.  The home machines have been bissells, one of which was a train wreck (tried to use a roller instead of brushes, didn't clean anything), the second which worked really well (standard brushes, could heat the water).  This appears to be Oreck's foray into the carpet cleaning side of it.  Out of the box it's pretty great, one piece to throw on and you are in business.  First impressions are that the unit is quite light, and seems to be quite compact.  Cleaning power is good, there are two styles of brushes, long bars (like on a traditional vacuum cleaner, but with heavier brushes on it) and then behind them round circles that spin as well (think street sweeper).  The machine does quite well on dirt, cleaning up a fair amount.  Some comments: - Because of the compact size the tanks are somewhat small.  If you're doing just a room it's not a big deal, but doing more and you might be changing tanks a lot.  This also keeps it light. - No heater/warmer.  The most recent bissell I used warmed the water as well, this made sure that you always had water up to temp instead of it cooling off.  Not sure that it is necessary, but is nice. - Accessories and the bag.  I kind of hate this, when manufacturers don't have a nice way to store things, they give you a cheap nylon bag, and you put everything in there.  In this case it's just the hose and hand attachment, but it's still annoying, would much rather this be stored on the machine like others. - Speaking of the hand/hose attachment, you have to hook up two different pieces, the suction piece and the water feed.  And it hooks up front and center making it all very awkward.  Kind of fiddly.  Plus it's not a powered hand attachment.  Overall the lightness and compactness is kind of Oreck's thing, and it comes through here.  Would have preferred better thought out accessory hose and a few other 'engineering' tweaks like that, but is a good carpet cleaner.
dyson  Love the dyson vacuum. Very light weight, compact size. great power. Works great on stairs. This is my second dyson. They improved the power cord retrction which is great..
Amazing  Amazing, it takes up dirt that our old vacuum left.  Makes us wonder how long the other has been missing it.
tile washer  works great  easy to use.  Had problem with first unit amazon replaced next day ! Whole house is tile & wood can not belive how much dirt it picks up  suggestion: order cleaner when you order unit  hard to find locally
Product has greatly improved from the purple ball. Longer cords, and hose , greater suction make it much easier!
Fabulous!  Fabulous vacuum and is ideal for quick cleanups and especially for the car. Highly recommend.
Awesome...Thanks!!!
This Dyson is much improved over the previous Dyson owned.
Sanches
amazing and HORRIFIED!!!  I am both amazed and disgusted by this vacuum. We were without a vacuum for about 2 weeks so when we first got it and used it I expected there to be a lot of dirt. We have a small 3 bedroom house all rooms except the bathroom is carpeted. I vacuumed all rooms, moved all furniture, rearranged, and basically deep cleaned and got about 4 canisters of dirt from the house. Again no vacuum for about 2 weeks so not surprised by that. About 24 hours later I wanted to vacuum again (gotta wear the new off) and was HORRIFIED by the amount of dirt I got off the floor just 24 hours from the first vacuuming.  The third day I vacuumed again and got the same result about 2 canisters full (up to full line) of fine almost sand like dirt. Now I live in a metropolitan area no where near any beaches/sand and we don't  go in and out of the house a lot I leave for work in the morning and come back 8 hours later that's about it. I have an 18 month old and was grossed out thinking about what she might be crawling around in on a daily basis.  I use this vacuum everyday now and the results are always the same it almost makes me want to live in a bubble. No loss of suction with this vacuum and even works on my tile floors in the kitchen/hallway/bathroom. I have no pets but I did get the AS One pet fuchsia flight because of the claim no loss of suction with easy to empty canister and it keeps those promises for sure.  The ONLY con I have about this vacuum is that it's not a push button empty canister. that is my personal preference though. The canister is still easy to empty twist off empty twist on and done. Highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a great vacuum under $100.
This a great vacuum for the money  This a great vacuum for the money! It sucks everything right up, is easy to use, and the has some great features. Love that the handle collapses for extra storage, the retractible cord, and the hose is longer than the previous model. Attachments work like a charm and suck all my dog's hair off upholstery, etc. I am particular about cleanliness and this vacuum meets my expectations. Would definitely recommend!
Best $50 I Ever Spent  I had an Electrolux upright that was about 15 years old but still worked well.  Then, we adopted a Newfoundland, and they shed--a lot.  I was changing bags every other time I vacuumed, which was several times a week, so I decided to look into a bagless vacuum.  What led me to purchase the Dirt Devil Breeze was not only the price but the number of positive consumer reviews I found online.  I have not regretted my purchase.  My carpet feels brand new after vacuuming.  It gets up every bit of dog hair and dirt.  My only criticism is that the air blows out the front of the machine.  I was using it in my kitchen, and it blew off all the papers that were attached by magnets on the front of the refrigerator.  Other than that, I can't complain and would enthusiastically recommend this vacuum.
Wonderful!!!  I just bought this vacuum yeasterday and was absolutely amazed how well it worked. My previous vacuum (a 5-yr-old Fantom Fury) just wasn't doing the trick.  Whenever my 7-month-old was on the floor he always managed to find the hair and crumbs the vacuum left behind even after vacuuming over the area several times. I did a lot of research through Consumer Reports as well as personal reviews wherever I could find them and settled on this one. After I put together this one and vacuumed I was disgusted and amazed by how much dirt was in the bin after only vacuuming the living room.  The bin is so much easier to empty than my old one and the hose isn't connected to the handle which frankly was a pain and didn't work very well. I think I definately chose the right vacuum!!!
great vacuum for the price  Really works well.........great vacuum for the price!!!
Great vacuum  I love this vacuum!  It picks up the pet hair (long, collie hair) really well!  Only thing that annoys me is that I have to touch the dirt because it won't just drop out of the bagless container.  But it doesn't bother me so much because of how well the vacuum works.
This is very good vacuum
Wonderful!  Fantastic product!  I have one that is about 10 years old and thought I should renew the brushes and squeegee after all that time.  Then I decided to buy the new one as it was on sale.  This model picks up the waste water as you scrub, leaving less water on the wood floor.  Then the "Dry" function nearly wipes it like a towel!  Walkable without leaving prints after a few seconds.  It also has interchangeable heads for wood floors (softer) and tile and grout (a little harder).  Easy to change out and clean.  Another improvement is a larger tank for both clean and dirty water.  Can get through two large rooms without a change.
Love this machine  Love this machine.  It is not my first Hoover but it is the best.  It is quiet and does a super job cleaning the floor.
use this daily  Great vaccum.  Wow does this thing pickup the dirt.  Our house is all hardwood and tile and we have 3 indoor cats, brooms just push the dirt around.  This vaccum is wonderful,  I never sweep now just pull out the vaccum and clean up.
Great vacuum!!  This is an awesome vacuum!  Cannot believe its so good for the price! It almost digs into the carpet! It pulled stuff out of the carpet that our older vacuum couldn't...and our old one is a good one (but we've now retired it). We have two dogs i the house and Shepard sheds. We use the vacuum on carpet, hard wood, and tile now.  I don't think we've swept since having this. Other reviews say cord is not long enough; I think it's plenty long! We have 3100sqft house and can get generally get two or more rooms from one outlet. The handle easily pulls out and is long enough so you can reach fireplace mantle (or higher). I vacuumed our dusty blinds with the attachment and was amazed! Its very light weight, very strong suction, and easily maneuverable.  I am very impressed with it!  Not sure about the long term durability but if it dies in a year, I would still most definitely buy this again!
PRETTY GOOD VACUUM  I bought this vacuum cleaner when my other one conked out a few weeks ago. Even though I've only had this vacuum for 2 days,it's a pretty good vacuum cleaner. It seems to pick up everything off the carpet and suck it right up. It's a tad noisy but then again what vacuum cleaner itsn't???  The only thing that I didn't like was when I took it out the box I had to put a few pieces together.. I mean I put them together ok (..or at least I think I did...) :\  I don't like to read insructions... especially when they're in cartoon and not the real picture of the product. I have a hard time following directions when it's not the real pic.  So if pieces start flying as I vacuum then I'll know that I didn't put it together o.k.  Overall it's a great vacuum for the money.
Very powerful vacumn.
great job
Positive experience  I am a veterinarian and I breed English Setters plus have two rescue dogs in my home.  I have mostly hardwood floors however there are some large area rugs. I always felt that I was accomplishing little when I used a competitive vacuum product.  I ordered the new Dyson and then vacuumed the porch floor with my old machine.  I repeated the job with the Dyson and picked up 3/4 of a canister of material my other vacuum had failed to retrieve.  That is all it took to sell me. I have since purchased the hard surface tool for use on the wood floors and again am delighted.  Now as long as the machine maintains problem free operation I will be a satisfied owner.
Great.  Little strong devil for now. Great.
Ah,,,wot a relief it is!  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Hoover-S3639-Bagged-WindTunnel-Canister-Vacuum/dp/B000AEGJ0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Hoover S3639 Bagged WindTunnel' Canister Vacuum</a>After wasting my hard earned dough on a crappy Kenmore machine with cheesy plastic tubes which broke the 2nd time I used it...this Hoover product really cleans my place up...It makes house work [almost] a joy! Seriously, it has a ton of great features, really gets down to the micro-crud level [allergens, dust mites and mold spores...oh my!], and does it's job well! I am well pleased to have finally found a great, solid performer for the home cleaning venue. Thank you.
Great value  This was #3 on Consumeers reports.  Those above it were selling for $300-$400!  At this prioce I could replace it5 or 6 times and still be ahead.  have had for years now with perfect results.  Excellent product.
This is an amazing vacuum. We had a Dyson and quickly realized it would not handle the dog hair (and human hair) that we have at our home. I love the different heights for the hoses. I use the shorter for our couch and the longer for under things. Important to note that you have to change hook ups for the vacuum and attachment but it's pretty easy, just slightly annoying as it's not a seamless transition however the suction power makes up for any slight annoyance or oddity of the vacuum. I don't think I'll ever use another vacuum unless they discontinue this one.
This vacuum is pretty amazing. You do have to clean it out a lot, but that's because it sucks up EVERYTHING. PROS turbo brush is awesome very good suction not too loud easy to clean CONS the hose is too short....it ends up falling over on me when i vacuum the rugs with the turbo brush
Love this vacuum  This is my third Eureka Boss. I have lots of animals in a big house with hardwood floors and large area rugs, runners, etc. After breaking several kinds of vacuums, I found The Boss. Not only does it keep my mostly black carpets free of animal fur, but it can handle going up and down over the edges of the rugs, which is what broke all the other vacuums I tried. The tools are easy to use, tho I've not had much luck with the small upholstery beater brush. I also prefer a bagged unit, which are increasingly hard to find. I'm pretty hard on a vacuum, but the name of this one certainly fits! I'd definitely recommend this vacuum!
Absolutely love my fusion  Absolutely love my fusion. My mother has had hers, which is almost identical to my new one that is 8 years old and still works like a charm. Im so glad to have bought this, it does an awesome job on both my wood/laminate floors as well as rugs and carpets.
Best Vacuum I've Ever Owned  Is it possible to love a vacuum? This guy is lightweight, fierce, and amazingly customizable. My favorite things about this Hoover: it's cordless--no more getting tangled or struggling to find an outlet; bagless; it's powerful for it's diminutive size; YOU CAN CLEAN IT--like woah, no joke, you can tear apart this vacuum and clean all its bits like the filter, the brush, and the dirt traps. My only dislike is that there is no warning when the battery dies so it'll just turn off in the middle of vacuuming.
still working well 2014-08-01
So much better for hardwood floors that my my Dyson.
dyson animal vacum  bought this animal dyson it work great as advertised help me with my cleaning would recommend to the dyson lovers great on pet hair and has a very strong suction also easy to clean love this vacuum was not disappointed with this
Very good  Good quality, suction pressure it's good, easy to handle, easy to clean and easy to clean filter, no filter replacements needed.
Wow  Bought one of these for my wife when we built our house, other than a little bit of beatdown from foot traffic my carpet still looks almost new, we've been here for three years now.  I've only ever heard one complaint from a shark owner.  He told me he didn't care for how many times he had to dump the container per room, guess he preferred dirty carpet.
There's An Attachment for Everything!  Okay, it took forever to choose which new vacuum I wanted.  I am in a wheelchair and so getting a vacuum that is easy for me to use was an issue.  The old one kept unlocking and falling on my leg...the bad one of course.  So I decided to try the old canister style.  I am over the moon in love with this thing!!  I took it in my bedroom when it arrived.  I was able to vacuum the wall behind the head of the bed, under the bed, took off the covers, vacuumed the mattress and then vacuumed the slatted blinds hanging in the bedroom windows.  It did amazing!  I have needed to be able to get under low profile furniture and this has an attachment for that.  In fact it has an attachment for whatever job you are doing.  It was worth every penny I paid for it!  I can pull it behind my wheelchair and with the extensions, can reach anything and everything without too much trouble.  The best part is when you want to empty it.  It's trap door design means no more mess everywhere when emptying.  You pinch a couple things on each side and lift by the handle.  No muss, no fuss.  If it ever stops suctioning it'self to the floor I will repost.  Meantime...I'm back to vacuuming the entire house myself again!
a step up and beyond  I have been doing the vacuuming of our 2 bed two bath florida patio home for the past several years. I am a 60+ male who agreed to share the housework with my wife. I have been used to Hoover and Eureka uprights for years. I have had tennis elbow for a year and the vacuuming doesn't help matters. I finally told my wife that it was time to investigate a better solution. Thus i researched canisters.  I went to a website that reviews all major brands. I even called the carpet dealer who installed our 2 year old plush frize wall to wall. He recommended a dyson which he said works great for he and his two dogs. I researched some more and decided to risk the big chunk of cash( my wife and I are both retired)on the Titan. I got the cleaner today .What a joy and the ease of use is amazing. IT feels like a piece of quality workmanship! It is very powerful and I ran it on the lowest setting which included the tile, low rugs and the wall to wall. I let my wife try it and she said she liked it. I took someone's suggestion of putting fragrent oil on a cotten ball and letting the vacuum have it. Now our house feels clean and smells fresh!  The person who complained about the heavy wand, why not try the heavy eureka boss for "heavy." I feel that i will now enjoy my job of vacuuming. And it is a great deal quieter than my Eureka! So thanks Miele and Amazon. I will recommend to all my friends!
awesome vacuum  I knew i was old when i got excited about a vaccuum.  I got this vaccuum because i noticed that my cheapo vaccuum simply wasn't picking up anything anymore.  This vaccuum gets everything (and you can see that it does).  I now have two- one for my upstairs and one for my basement.
Change of Mind From One to Five  When I received my vacuum, I thought I really made a mistake and wished to return it.  My opinion has changed dramatically. It is all as promised. The suction is excellent and the arrangement of on vacuum tools is so convenient. And switching from carpet to bare floor or to the hand tool is so very convenient. Excellent vacuum and I would certainly recommend it to anyone in the market.
I love this little vacuum! (Bought two)  Bought this for my elderly mother so she wouldn't lug her heavier vacuum up and down stairs.  Her home was for sale and it was so easy to whip this out every morning to keep the carpets dust free.  I was especially pleased with the way it picked up white "bits" and threads from red carpet and dark blue carpet; it was also very easy to use on the carpeted stairs.  She found she could vacuum both stories and the stairway on one charge - was easy for her to remove the battery and recharge it in readiness for the next use.  Couldn't talk her out of it once she moved to a one-floor home so I bought another for myself!!
Best vacuum I ever owned  Prior to purchasing a Dyson, we had to buy a new vacuum every year. With many pets and two long-haired people in the house, regular vacuums lost suction, burned out, or just stopped working. We've had the Dyson Animal for about 8 years and it works wonderfully. A plastic clip broke off the elbow bend several years ago but it has not impacted the function.  With regular cleanings of the brush assembly, the Dyson Animal easily handles fur, feathers, scales, and dirt on carpet and hard flooring. Christmas tree needles killed our Hoover, and while the Dyson does not always pick up all the needles it does not burn out or lose suction.  Pros: No bags. Never loses suction. Easy to clean filter and brush assembly. Relatively light weight. Telescoping wand with large trigger button. Clear cup so you can see items you shouldn't have vacuumed up. Attractive colors.  Cons: Expensive compared to other retail vacuums. Plastic parts are somewhat fragile. Long hair tangles in brushes. Even slightly damp carpet causes dirt to stick like glue. Attachments fall off their storage mountings and get lost. Cup does not always empty easily when opened.
Electorlux Vaccumn  I really like this vaccumn. I don't care for the no bags vacumns that you have to cleanout,too much trouble!
Worth getting if you hate to iron like me  This takes the place of my iron !!  It's much convenient , and less time consuming ! If you are picky like I was.... I say go for it!!
Rather than buy brand new, this time I decided to buy refurbished!!!  I was so pleased.  The Vacuum Cleaner looks brand new and works great.  It was packaged securely and delivered timely.  Thank you very much!
Even better than my old Kenmore  I got this to replace my Kenmore from 2005. It mostly still worked great but had a connection problem with the carpet attachment. I got the one that seemed most similar despite being a wacky purple color and boy is it good. Its suction is so strong that I was walking it across the room and it sucked up an entire 8 sheer curtain that was Laid out on a chair-sucked it up entirely in 2 seconds. I could hardly believe it. Nice storage of attachments. Easy to use.
Small, light, and powerful.  I purchased this as a mother's day present for my mom (and dad.)  So far no problems at all with it.  She raves and raves about it, its so light so manuverable, and most importantly leaves the floor clean.  They have a short haired dog, and this thing picks up dog hair like magic. I debated between this one and animal specific model, but opted for the lighter one. Maybe in the future the dog-hair-duty will cause problems but no signs of that now.  The only negative so far is that my mom mentioned she was having a little trouble with extension tool in terms of getting to the places she needed. According to her its stiff and she's afraid she'll break it.  It took a bit of assembly too, but my Dad did all that and said it was easy. (He was a mechanic though...)
Great value!!!  Wish I'd bought this on Amazon instead of in the store. It would have a been a little cheaper. That being said, I'm very happy with this vacuum so far. Kenmore has  made this vacuum in various versions for decades and this is my second one. The first one lasted about 14 years before it finally gave up the ghost. I can't speak to the longevity of this version yet, but it appears to be the same high quality, just with a few updated features that I appreciate having. The only other vacuum I've owned was a very high end ultra light weight Riccar upright that I used for years in my housekeeping business. That being said, I had  housekeeping customers who wanted me to use my machine and customers who wanted me to use theirs, so I've probably used a lot more vacuums than the average consumer over the years.  In my experience, this is the best vacuum cleaner you're going to get outside of a dedicated vacuum cleaner shop. Shark and Dyson are extremely clumsy and gimmicky, and no matter what the marketing says they lose suction worse than bagged model vacuum machines. They are also very messy to dump the dust cup from compared to changing a vacuum cleaner bag. In my experience, if you change the bags and filters on time on a high quality vacuum and give it a good cleaning every once in a while, it won't loose suction.  The design on this Kenmore is very well thought out. Honestly, I can't understand why power team canisters aren't a lot more popular. When I would use a customer's upright with attachments I was always annoyed with short hoses, machines toppling over when reaching for something using the attachments, and dealing with getting the hose in and out of the machine was usually a pain. On top of all those annoyances, you can't even vacuum your hard floors with an upright w/ attachments. With this canister machine, it's really simple. You just push a button with your foot and the wand pops right out. Go ahead and suck up that pile of paper clips your kids left on the floor, the hose is huge so they won't get stuck. Go ahead and reach for those cobwebs on the ceiling. The wand telescopes so it won't take you any time to assemble a wand, AND you're machine won't fall over while you do it. Go ahead and vacuum under the couch. The power head has a low profile and the wand lays flat against the floor, so you can get under all but the tightest places. Unlike my last Kenmore canister, the power had seems to work just as well on hard floors as carpets, so I don't even have to change the head when going from room to room or rug to bare floor! I love it.  When I got this I assumed it wouldn't vacuum my carpets as well as my Riccar. (I wouldn't have even replaced the Riccar, but I shorted the circuit board with moisture and the machine was so beat up from years of cleaning houses with it, it wasn't worth the repair cost anymore.) I was alright with the idea that it might take a few more minutes to vacuum the carpet because I figured I was getting the convenience of being able to spot vacuum corners and couch cushions as I did entire rooms in trade for being able to sweep up ground in dog hair in one pass. I was wrong. I hadn't had a working vacuum for two weeks in June in a house with two big shedding dogs when I finally decided to go back to the Kenmore canister. The Kenmore sucked it right up in one pass. I was very happy! As a bonus, it's a lot easier to push across my relatively thick, plush, carpet than my wonderful Riccar ever was.  There are a couple of things about this Kenmore canister that concern me in terms of longevity. The big back wheels seem kind of flimsy. I worry that one of them might snap off eventually. It seems like a really odd design choice because everything  else about the machine appears to be well thought out both in terms of usability and durability. My other concern is that the pieces inside the metal extension wand that hold the attachments on are plastic and not metal. They do, however, seem to be pretty sturdy plastic and they hold firmly. I can't remember if my last Kenmore canister had plastic or metal clips, but I do remember they never broke over the years that the machine cleaned up after lots of pets in a big, dirty, farm house.  All in all, I really don't think you can get a better designed, more powerful, or durable vacuum machine at this price. The only other machine I know of that comes close in terms of usability is the Meile canister power team and it costs three times as much. Plus, the variable suction control for the Kenmore is on the handle instead of the canister, unlike the Meile, and the bags are cheaper. The Meile is probably more likely to last a lifetime though, so if you've got the cash it's probably a worthy investment. I didn't have a grand to drop on a vacuum cleaner, so I got this Kenmore and I couldn't be happier with it.
love, love, love!  This is the best vacuum I have ever owned!  I have slate floors in our family room, scraped wood floors elsewhere and carpeted floors.  This vacuum adjusts to all with no problem.  The suction is amazing and it is easier to clean than any others I have ever used.  The only negative is the extension hose is pretty stiff.  I am guessing it will loosen up over time and stretch further.
Powerful vac  I just bought this vacuum to clean my house after our other vacuum stopped picking up dog hair. This Hoover WindTunnel is so far amazing. I have an Eskie and this vacuum picked up hair I couldn't even see-- the floor looked clean but it kept picking up dirt and hair! The sensors are great. I feel like I live in a whole new house!  While I have only used the vacuum on the entire house once, at this point I would recommend it to anyone who has pets and really wants their floors clean! Not only does my house look clean, it FEELS clean.
Concrete floors  Great! i have concrete floors and this works wonders! Im so happy i picked mine up at Target today!
Great Vacuum Bad rap  Some of the reviews give this a bad rap. It is a great Vacuum with good suction (Still gets dirt up after Housekeeper leaves from using an old Dyson). Purchased as housekeeper leaving so needed a good Vac. Price was well below retail and received quickly.  Light weight, easily maneuvered, great suction and easily cleaned......quiet too!. I don't see why you wouldn't want to buy!
Love, love my Dyson  Love, love my Dyson. This is my second Dyson. The first one I purchased over 15 years ago and have had no problems that I couldn't fix myself. It still works and I use it for dirtier jobs now and have my new one as my main vacuum. I will never buy another brand of vacuum. Dyson has proven it's worth to me.
Perfect for hardwood and carpet floors  I've never written a review before but I spent so much time researching vacuums that I wanted to let others know how much I love my new Hoover WindTunnel Canister Vacuum. I needed something that would work on both hard wood floors and carpeting. I have a Golden Retriever so I vacuum every day to get rid of the dog hair. I don't like using a regular upright vacuum on the hardwood floors because it is slower to maneuver and the uprights don't seem to pick up the dirt as well. On this vacuum, you take the powerhead off and put on the hardwood floor attachment. The suction works great and you can vacuum a large floor quickly. I also like that it has variable speeds. When I'm ready to vacuum the carpets, I just plug the power head back onto the end of the wand and it's ready to go. The vacuum picks up an amazing amount of dirt, it's light weight and it is easy to carry up the stairs. I also like thebagless feature. The last bagless vacuum I had was time consuming and difficult to empty. This one is quite easy. Just take the top off of the dirt container, turn it upside down over the trash, empty it and you're done.
really a great machine to own  really a great machine to own...read some reviews on how much noise it made, however, this machine was not that way...really performed well and well worth the money....clean up is a breeze and light weight too..you'll never use that old fashion mop again....mine's in the trash.....A+ machine!
Really Sucks  Best Ever!!!
The best little vacuum for the price. Does the job on hardwood floors and carpet.
All the Power for Almost No Weight  This is the best basic upright vacuum I've ever used. Without all the hoses and accessories, it doesn't get caught on furniture and lays flatter to get under the same furniture. Since I have an Orek canister model, which I also love to pieces, I don't need all the bells and whistles on my upright. The Magnesium is the lightest vacuum you'll probably ever come across. Carrying it from floor to floor is actually easy. It has two power settings so you can do hard floor with it. I almost never break out the broom and dust pan anymore. Seriously, I no longer cringe and look for excuses to not vacuum like I did in the past because my Orek Magnesium makes cleaning the floors the least difficult of all the housework tasks. Obviously, I highly recommend it, and, no, I wasn't paid to write this review. It's really worth every penny of its cost. By the way, we bought it reconditioned. It was still pretty pricey but I feel I got the better value.
I was skeptical about buying a vacuum online, however this vacuum works great. It seemed a little cheaply made for the price I paid, but it worked great! I am amazed at how well it worked at picking up pet hair and other particles that I the eye can not see.
Factory-Reconditioned Dyson DC15  Product arrived as advertised promptly and in good condition. Wife is very happy with her new vacuum.
Love it!  This is great on my Wood floors and one rug!
Siberian husky moms best vacuum  See we have a fully Siberian Husky and our old vacuum was not doing its job leaving hair in the couch and carpet. After my hubby secretly ordered this for me I was very very impressed as to how light weight it is and easy to maneuver around the house. Plus as our husky girl grows and blows her coat it seems to be able to get every hair in the house, the furniture, our cars, and my hubbys semi truck. Plus it has filters that work wonders on keeping the dirty dog smell contained until ready to dispose of. If you have a dog that sheds a ton I fully recommend this.
Very good for small flat with a lot of nooks and crannies.  Good product for that price. I was looking for vacuum cleaner with a canister and this one is working nicely. Suck very nice. Has many exchangeable endings so you can choose how and what you would like to vacuum. It is a good option for people who has small apartment with a lot of nooks and crannies.
BEST SWEEPER I COULD HAVE BOUGHT!  I went from using a twenty year old bag canister ten years too long to this marvel of a machine! Been looking for a sweeper replacement for a couple of years. After checking out another Kenmore, a Hoover, and a couple of others models I forget the names of, I ran into the DYSON with all the five star recommendations backing it up, and went for it. Yep, the price choked me up a lot, but after I used it twice and picked up about three canisters of dirt INCLUDING THE FINE DUST that I have a hard time breathing, it was worth it. And that was from carpet I had been sweeping regularly with the old Kenmore. I bought the purple and red DYSON and the floor tool, which is necessary to get under beds and other furniture. And the dirt dumping is simple and quick. No bags, I love it! You will, too.
So easy to use and does an excellent job!  This is perfect for my cabin!  Easy to take up and down stairs, comfortable to doing over my shoulder, and does a great job.
Very good product  Excellent product.  I found this very easy to handle and was pleased with the cleaning power.
Lightweight and easy to maneuver with plenty of suction.  Lightweight and easy to maneuver.  I find it has plenty of suction for hardwood and vinyl floors that we have throughout the first floor of our house.  Does OK on area rugs and rugs we have need entry doors...not as good on these as the upright we used when the house was mostly carpeted, but still picks up most items from the rugs.  For hard surface vacuuming though, I think this is a great value.  Took my wife a little longer to get used to it, but she is quite happy with it too!
works for my falling hair  After owning this Shark navigator for more than 1 year and a half, I decided to write a review. This is great not only for pet hair, but for people like me who shed hair like crazy. I have a long hair and I shed like a dog all over our place. I've tried other vacuum cleaners, but the suction isn't as strong as this one. I end up manually brushing & picking up hair strands from the vinyl floor/carpet when I use my 2 other vacuum cleaners. I recently donated my spare vacuum cleaners as I find this Shark Navigator enough for my needs. I'm so glad I did not purchase Dyson because it's way too expensive. Shark does the job, I don't need to spend more on a Dyson. After more than 1 1/2 years of owning this Shark, I can say that I am very pleased with my purchase. I am getting myself a handheld Shark soon for car cleaning.
looovvvveee it  I absolutely love this thing!!!! This is my second one like this... First one lasted forever. My house is all hard wood and tile this thing works great on both. Has separate brushes for each but I always forget to change them. My other one I think had bigger tanks, but I'm not complaining its so much easier and more effective than mopping!!! Never again will I use a mop!!
it sucks your socks off  Wow this baby has power, it sucks your socks off. A good product for the money. you will not be sorry
Does a great job  I will simply list what I like and what I don't like. Likes: No vacuum bags needed, large capacity container, easy to clean, lightweight, maneuverable, powerful suction, useful attachments. Dislikes: Like every other vacuum cleaner I've owned, I wish the cord was two feet longer. Oh, and it is now about $30 cheaper than when I purchased it
Very easy to use and carry from room to room. Would recommend.
it is easy to maneuver  I wanted a smaller vacuum for lighter cleaning. This Dyson does the job of a big vac, the cleaning is superb, it is easy to maneuver, easy to dump the collected dirt with no bags to replace. I would buy it again
I love this product  I love this product. Cleans my hardwood floors and my tile floors fine. I love they it vacuums and washes the floor at the same time.
She loves it .
Awesome vacuum!  This vacuum has outdone our $600 Dyson. Small and light weight. Easy to assemble and to maneuver.
Bissell power  If you have pets then you need to buy this product. Works very well on tile or deep carpet. I could not live without it.
The best cheaper vacuum cleaner I ever purchased ...until I used it three times.  I purchased this from Amazon on July 5, 2016 and received it the next day!  That was yesterday.  So why the fast review when I had it only one day?  Many reasons.  I have purchased many vacuum cleaners in my life to include many top of the line Hoovers (self-propelled) and two Dysons.  I found these broke down just as fast as the cheapest I had bought.  My current Dyson now has a brush that does not revolve and the fix is to buy a new unit that encloses the brush.  This is a big ticket cost!  I talked to people that had recently purchased the newer Hoover's costing $100 or less.  I tried them and they worked just as well as my Dyson.  When it arrived yesterday I was able to get it out of the box and working within 10 minutes.  A very easy set up, even for me who barely knows a screw driver from a hammer.  I did not even read the instructions but used the picture on the box it was shipped in.  I don't recommend this because the instructions do have some valuable information one must know, such as cleaning the reusable filter.  Next week I will probably have to do that.  I immediately vacuumed my home office first.  I had black stains under my desk from the dirty shoes I wore. There was also a lot of crushed potato chips and fallen peanuts!  This vacuum cleaner removed everything in four repeated sweeps!  Had this been fresh debris it would have done it in one sweep.  Ok, I agree I am premature to review this after one use of the vacuum cleaner.  However, I promise to give an update if I find any issues.  I will also update this review in the near future for positive news.  Update: July 19, 2016  Negative news to report and I have down graded this from 5 star to 3 star.  The first time I used this product I noticed the bottom dirt door release was cheaply done and, if not careful, would come open unexpectedly when emptying the dirt from the tank.  I did not bother about reporting this since this was a simple matter and the vacuum was...well cheap!  However today, my wife found the cord rewind mechanism would no longer retract even though she had pulled it out only about 2/3 thirds it's length.  Pulling it out further and releasing it, did not fix it.  We now have a vacuum with a cord that does not retract and there are no cord holders to wrap it around.  This is covered under the warranty but the nearest authorized repair shop is in Tucson, Arizona about 90 miles from our home.  So we are stuck with keeping it and winding the cord like a hose when not in use.  Update:  July 20, 2016 I am changing this back to five stars!  I just got off the phone from Hoover's customer's service and they are sending me a new vacuum without postage charges and/or fees.  They said that they could not expect me to travel 90 miles to Tucson for repair.  You can't beat that for customer's service.
Satisfied customer  I never owned a vacuum as powerful as this one.  I love the fact that it is lightweight and easy to dispose of the dirt by just one click of a button.  It really does the job! I actually enjoying cleaning now.
I love this vacuum  I've had this about a year and I do love it.  This is a dog household and I have tile floors.  My dogs are low shed but that doesn't mean no shed and I find hair bunnies hidden under the furniture, lots of dirt from them running in and out and this is great, great suction, but I probably wouldn't recommend this for carpet.
Great value vacuum  We ordered this vacuum after our Hoover gave out.  The price was right and had the features we wanted, other than the retracting cord we had on our Hoover.  The other reviews said it had excellent suction, but was very loud. I agree with the excellent suction, but have not found it to be very loud at all.  It is quieter than our Hoover.  I also really like the ease of using the hose and attached tools.  The rolling brush attachment makes cleaning furniture so easy and has a lot of power.  We don't have pets, so pet hair isn't an issue, but our house is mainly tile floors and it works just as well on tile as it does on carpeting.  I would highly recommend this as a good value vacuum.
Terrific vacuum!  My upright vacuum died unexpectedly so I consulted Consumer's Reports and made Amazon purchase of this unit due to its high rating. IT arrived very quickly, was super simple to make the handle attachment, then I set about using it.  WHOA Nelly - this baby pulls itself forward - kind of like a "self propelled" lawn mower does!  Very interesting as I then noted my energy was mostly expended on the "return stroke" (you know - it pulls itself forward where you steer it, then you pull it back before you steer it forward again).  But not that I'm complaining about that - just is an observation.  So I thought I would vacuum a bedroom that is little used and had been vacuumed with my old unit just a week before - and I was amazed at the amount of fibers etc that this vacuum accumulated in its dirt canister!  So then it was time to empty the canister - well I strongly recommend one does this outside of your home into a bag or other receptacle because the fact you can release a latch and the dirt "drops out" is true but in order to get "stuff" from around the interior edges to drop out, you MUST tap the canister collection unit - and that's when the dust cloud arises.  Since I always go out to my 55g rollaround garbage bin to empty my vacuum canisters - this not a huge inconvenience to me but I mention it because I recall Hoover citing the "open latch, dirt falls out" as part of their marketing pitch. Would I recommend this reasonably priced and strong performing vacuum to others!  absolutely - especially if like me, you have no stairs to vacuum, or climb with this unit to the upper floor.
Good choice  Great vacuum. powerful, useful, good set of accessories, easy to clean. The cable is not very long, but it is enough (especially taking into account how light the vacuum is).
Does a great job. The pet attachments work very well  Does a great job.  The pet attachments work very well, too!
Very happy with service and Rainbow vacuum
Dyson DC39 Vacuum Cleaner  You can't go wrong with a Dyson of any type.  This one is the best.  It does a remarkable job on all surfaces.
Love it  A friend told me about the Dyson Vac and how wonderful it managed a house with three dogs. I have an Australian cattle dog who is always leaving hair behind,  but now that I have my Dyson vac it's cleaned up before It becomes a problem. I have never  had a more user friendly vacuum .  I ordered the dog grooming attachment  and it works better than expected!!!  I plan on ordering another Dyson dc 41 for my cabin.  Thank you for a wonderful product.
Love this!  Love this !! Did exactly what I needed it to do a little heavy but I can over look that great price too !
Love, love  Love, love, love it.  I have yet to be sold on the bagless wave of vacuums.  I've tried them and have found nothing positive about them.
The best vacuum I have every owned. Love.
It's simple, lightweight and it works and the price is reasonable.  I love this vacuum.  It's simple, lightweight and it works and the price is reasonable.  - The carpet function was amazing. Strong suction and really cleans the carpet well. I need to try it with carpet cleaner to see if it has the same effect. - The extendable attachment brush is great. - Extension cord is very long. - Noise level is decent compared to other vacuums I owned. - Clean up and emptying the vacuum is a little messy and dusty, but better than vacuum bags any day!
it makes me happy  We bought the DC17 to upgrade a Hoover we bought for $100 about 7 years ago. At the time we bought it we lived in an apartment with no dogs etc. It is still running but a large house and 2 dogs later, I needed something with some suction to combat pet hair. Well I found in the DC17. I wouldn't call it a miracle worker -- you will still find that some hair that's been engrained in your carpet for years does not magically get sucked up. BUT most of it will. I have noticed my housing staying cleaner, longer and the air quality being better.  Another great thing about the vaccuum is all the attachments. I can vaccuum under my sofa now without moving it! Ditto for the bed. The wand is awesome!  If I was to improve this vaccuum, I would do 2 things -- retractable cord, and make it easier to carry attachments with you as you vaccuum.
Wow! This product is great. My floors are squeaky clean in no time at all! I have always washed my hardwood floors with vinegar and water, so I used vinegar instead of cleaner and it worked like charm. (I use multi-purpose cleaner on rugs, bathrooms, and laundry room.) I particularly like that the floors and rugs aren't completely saturated. They are almost dry after one additional pass of the machine. I thought my floors were clean, but after using my CrossWave I realize that I was kidding myself. Great product!
Better buy then the dept. stores  Brought it for mother's day for mom she was thrilled at the ease of the vacuum. She loves it.
this is a blessing to the old one and works great or much better than the older one  my old one the original one my GF grand kid killed it but was well used and got this one. this is a blessing to the old one and works great or much better than the older one. am happy and still working great for some time now as long as i do not let her use this one.
HIghly Recommend!  Wow, love this vacuum.  It was rated as a Consumer Reports best buy this year, and now I understand why. It performs well - you feel like your carpet is getting very clean.  It has great suction.  It is also much quieter than I expected (but then my previous vacuum was rather loud).  Overall, I HIGHLY recommend it. It is a good vacuum for a great price. If you want a reliable upright at a reasonable price, don't look further. Save yourself time and effort. This is it. Just buy it.
Serious Vaccum  I did a weeks worth of research for a home vaccum that had the skill of a Dyson vaccum at a moderate price. The Bissell 3990 is nothing short of amazing. * The wide angle is able to achieve more coverage than you think, and rotating brushes really help!!!! * This is the first time I have gotten a vaccum with a scatter-guard and it has been a huge plus on bare floors where my previous vaccums were more proficient at spraying dirt at my legs * The long chord is extremely useful for a small size home, I used to spend half my time unplugging my previous vaccum between power ports, the Bissell can cover about 2 rooms easily (an automatic cord rewinder could have been a good addition to the product). * The dual cyclonic action is really great, it sucks out dirt (quantities Id never imagined), however, the upper part of the dirt can collects some dirt while vaccuming which remains there and does not fall very easily on the removeable part of the dirct can and hence causes a little mess when you pull out the can to empty. * the upholstery hose has tremendous suction and stretches very long and with the attachments is very useful in cleaning stairs, since the vaccum in itself is very light - stretching the hose that extra distance causes stability issues on the vaccum causing it to fall sometimes  Overall, I am very impressed with the vaccum, it is more than its value for money and I am more than willing to overlook the minor/ cosmetic issues. Thanks Bissell for a great product!!!
best vacum ever  Have had for over a month now,it is very light compared to our 8 yr old hoover bagless vacuum that we finally retired. We returned to the bag model because we got tired of emptying the old  bagless  hoover. It was just to messy and time consuming .  Dust would get every where . The new hoover is quieter ,sucks better,no dust , better design,longer cord,bright led light, easy to carry up and down the stairs . this really is a great vacuum. Plus you get the handy canister vacuum,which took a little to get use to, since we were always use to onboard tools with the old hoover, which over time , the onboard tools would always fall off while vacuuming. we do not have very thick rugs or carpets,which we read in previous reviews that the platinum hoover had problems with. But if you want a very light weight vacuum with powerful suction, without all the mess of emptying , and a great price. I would strongly recommend this model. Also on other reviews some people thought the replacement bags were expensive , not true. check the prices out on amazon and you decide.
Works find for me.
Best ever  Best cleaner so far. I have been with this brand for many years. I recomend this to everyone, please pruchase this
Hoover bagless vacumn  Although I have just had this Hoover canister for a short time, I am very pleased with it.  It is light in weight and it does a very good cleaning of my carpets. I have no regrets about purchasing it.
WOW  I researched/read MANY reviews for canister vacuums. My husband had an old heavy upright vac that I could bearly lift and was on its last legs. I decided on a canister vac because we have two sets of stairs and was tired of trying to lug the vacuum up and down them. Well, the old vac died right before we had some relatives coming over for dinner and their child has alergies to animals and we have 4 dogs (and 3 boys). So instead of buying from Amazon like I planned I had to run out to Wal-mart real quick and buy this vacuum. I paid $199 for it. I LOVE this vacuum. It is light weight and VERY easy to use. The one brush attachment doesnt work all that well and does fall off easily if you don't cram it on the end of the nozzle. But other than that I was totally amazed at how well this thing works. You do have to empty the collection cup often but that doesnt bother me, just shows how well the thing is working and I wouldnt want it larger because it would add more weight to the machine. I have only had this for a couple weeks and I read some reviews that say the hoses come unattached after some time, however I think if you don't pull the thing around by the hoses that won't happen. The cord and hoses are a nice length in my opnion. Just pick the canister up and move it closer to your area of concentration (its certainly light enough) instead of dragging it to you by the hose. Until I had to make a decision that day I was still a little undecided on which canister vac I should buy, but am very, very glad I chose the Hoover Wind Tunnel.
It's a Dyson..nuf said  Yes, it's expensive, but it's also the best.  Have you heard the stories about vacuuming with your current unit then give your new Dyson a try?  Those stories are completely TRUE.  You will be blown away by how much more stuff the Dyson picks up.  And we have a large dog and this unit works fantastically at picking up the hair.
Highly impressed  I bought this vacuum to replace a cheap one that didn't work too well. It vacuumed up so much stuff my old vacuum kept missing that I was stunned. It made me feel like my apartment was filthy, even though I keep it really clean. I'm definitely very happy and impressed with this Bissell vacuum.
It really is an ANIMAL  This is an excellent vacuum.  The suction is great!  It performs just as well or even better than my $1700 Kirby Vacuum.  Price is reasonable for this high quality item.  I love it!
I love this vacuum  I love this vacuum. Works so well. I'm not a big fan of vacuums with tubes or that are in this sort of design but the effectiveness of this vacuum makes up for that. I have a cat with a heavy coat and my boyfriend is allergic to him, so having this vacuum has made a world of a difference for him. It comes with an attachment specifically for pets and it works better than any other vacuum I've tried. I recently went through 3 vacuums and this one was the winner of them all.
High quality  Does everything well and the self propel feature makes it effortless.  Only 1 minor issue, the little power vac tool keeps falling out of its storage slot.
Shark Navigator Lift-Away Deluxe  Excellent machine, pulled a lot of dust and dirt from our carpet, thought we had it clean but this cleaner has a stronger vacuum than our old worn out vacuum cleaner.  Quiet, easy to push around and no dust smell with all the filters installed. Great for those that suffer from dust allergies.  Bought it for the detachable part for the carpet on the stairs.  Highly recommend.
Greatest vacuum on the market
Great Price, don't be afraid of a refurb  Dyson is an excellent vacuum and don't be afraid of a refurb.  We had a small amount of shipping damage to the vac and dyson promptly arranged to fix it.  Other than this, it was just like a brand new dyson, but at a reasonable price.  The vacuum itself is great.  Note it only comes with a 6 month warranty so consider buying an add on warranty just in case
Does a great job. We have 2 dogs that bring in a lot of dander and we vacuum once to twice a week. Does a great job and easy to maneuver and clean.
I love it!  It's great!! I really like it, it came the day it was expected and every piece is here. Works good and it's a good size!
Very easy to use and cleans carpets and floors ver well
I'm glad I bought it  Performed exactly as advertised. Really did vacuum dry floor. I was skeptical prior to purchasing. Having used it 4 times, I'm glad I bought it. Throw away that spin mop.
DYSON VS HOOVER  I OWN BOTH DYSON BAGLESS AND HOOVER PLATINUM BAGLESS. FOR THE MONEY THE HOOVER OUT PERFORMS THE DYSON.IN ALL CATAGORIES SUCTION IS MUCH STRONGER AND MOST OF ALL IT'S AMERICAN MADE.
It sucks!!! But In a good way. Lady thinks it's heavy
Excellent For What It Is - A Very Compact Vacuum  This Dyson is small and light.  Given it's size and weight it's great.  The quality is excellent and the functionality is impressive.  As others have said this is for a small home and preferably without carpets.  The power head is light and small so it is not well suited for carpets, we also have a Dyson DC40 which is much better suited for carpets.  We bought this for a small (500 sqft with small closets) guest apartment which has laminate floors and one area rug.  For our application this is almost the ideal vacuum.
BEST vacuum I have ever had!
GREAT VACUMN!  Love this vacumn.  My brother has bought 2 of them & he recommended it to me.  I am 81, small and do all of my housework.  This vacumn makes it so easy.  Bought my 2 sons one for Christmas (each) and they love them.  One wand was missing from one vacumn & I don't know how to get another one, without paying for it (which I shouldn't have to).
Easy to push too  We have a cat and a dog and this cleaner really picks up the hair.  It also picked up the deep down dirt so well, I had to empty the bin many times.  Easy to push too.
Great machine  I just got this vacuum delievered to me. I couldn't wait to get it set up. Putting this vaccum together was easy easy easy, three screws and it was done, took me about five minutes. I turned it on and started to clean my house. WOW!!! I clean my house everyday and the stuff that this vacuum picked up was amazing. I am so glad I bought this bissell vacuum. I highly recommend this machine to everybody. It took me a long time to decide which vacuum I'm going to buy and I'm so glad I got this one. The price is great especially at Amazon.com without the shipping you just can't beat that. From the day I ordered it to the day I received it was all but four days, great job Amazon.com. I will definitly be back and buy at this website again. Thank you.
Love the features, tough little machine  Took me a while to find the right website for ordering replacement parts ([...]  I'm hoping a new HEPA filter and pre- post-filters shows up in good shape.  This is a great vacuum, even if you end up dumping out the canister after every room. Hey, if you're borderline OCD like me, you'll get a thrill from seeing how much dirt you're getting out of your house.  Rinsing the HEPA filter worked great. Mine needs replacement only because I cleverly left it on top of my car to dry, and drove off with it still perched up there.  I also tend to smack the daylights out of it during empties. (p.s. 'tapping' the filter clean indoors is crazy, dust flies everywhere)  Only drawbacks to me: the holding handle is awkwardly placed, especially if you store it upright, and a wider dust-brush attachment would be nice. (My husband complains about the high pitch noise of the engine, but I advise him to leave the room or start using our other vacuum himself)  This vacuum is great if you need a versatile, lightweight alternative to regular vacuums, and the attachments are nicely sized for smaller hands.
Love it  Love it. I was using Hoover Platinum collection Linx Cordless Stick Vacuum for 2 years. I liked it because it is light-weight and cordless, but I had to change the filter once every 2 weeks. Filters get dirty easily. I was also not happy with the power of suction. Dyson DC40 has strong power of suction and not heavy (not as light as Hoover Platinum) but I'm very very happy with my Dyson DC40.
Good value  Nice vacuum for the money. Wish it had a light on it like most. But not a big deal.
Everything good
love my dyson, the best purchase i've ever made for my home maintenance
LOVE IT,LOVE IT, REALLY LOVE IT. WORKS great, does a great job.
Buy this vacuum!  Exceptional!  My housekeeper ordered one for her home after using my vacuum!
Picks up the finest dirt  After buying and returning a Meile 600 series vacuum, I purchased this Dyson in the hopes it could do what the Miele (or any other vacuum for that matter) could not do: to suck up the fine grit that the dog tracks in in all winter. The Dyson gets every speck of dirt from my laminate floors with the rotating head attachment (not with the bare floor brush though). I thought I was being overly neurotic and/or too optimistic to think that a vacuum would actually vacuum *all* the dirt on the floor. I would try vacuum after vacuum, and ran my fingers over the floor only to find sand and grit still there.  The Dyson It moves around well (better than the Miele), and the attachments work fine, though the furniture attachment is frustrating as I can't seem to find the optimal angle for the best suction. Vacuuming is fun and easy with this machine.  I don't find the cord too short for my condo, but it's not a very big space.
It's all good
AWESOME!!!! With a VERY fast delivery.
Great for small living spaces  I was looking for a great vacuum under $50, which I realize is a tough order.  I ordered this based on the Amazon reviews and I'm very glad I did. This little vacuum is very compact and packs a powerful punch.  I was so surprised to discover how dirty the carpet in my apartment actually was! A great feature about this is it doesn't need any bags and can be cleaned easy.  It's fairly small for a vacuum so of course the dirt compartment fills up quicky, but thats fine for me because I'm in the habit of emptying it regularly anyways.  The cord is also very long, which is nice because you can do several rooms at once without having to change outlets if you have a small setup.  I have a cat (short hair) and I think this is great for picking up pet hair, the extra add-ons also work well. It's very lightweight and easy to carry.  This was the perfect purchase for my needs, considering I have one cat, and a 2 bedroom apartment around 1000sq feet.  May not be ideal for a whole house, and it doesn't have the features of a $200+ vacuum, but still an awesome value, shipping was fast, comes pretty much ready to use right out of the box. I would highly recommend if your not looking to spend a lot on a vacuum.
It sucks! In a perfect way  It sucks!  In a perfect way.
Very Happy  To me, this is a great tool with a great price. Sooo easy to use and sooo powerful. I recommend it to everyone.
great
This little Bissell Zing is awesome! I love that after each use  This little Bissell Zing is awesome! I love that after each use, I can fully clean all working parts. It is very easy to use and very, very easy to clean. This beats using bags for the waste since I cleaned all the edges around my house and I can tell you, I have two golden retrievers who have a lot of hair to clean. It was not problem for the Zing. I would recommend this product to anyone who doesn't want to drag out a big vacuum to do the edges around the house. I used it on my carpeted basement stairs and got all the dog hair (and anything else) off the stairs!
EZ and efficient  terrific cleaner of ceramic tile floors with properly installed grout. No need to knee scrub so great for anyone with a compromised back or hip issues. Less satisfactory in cleaning irregular bluestone floors, but does clean them with with harder set of brushes. EZ to use--two clear hard plastic half gallon containers and two brush sets EZ to install-uninstall. The cord can be wound up on the unit. Only bad thing is its LOUD. Just wear plugs.
Many features just like the Dyson!  This thing is lit, easy to steer, has a long cord, and sucks up everything. So glad I got this rather than shelling out hundreds more on the Dyson. Beyond thrilled, wish I had done it sooner!
Not A Sales pitche This Really Works  Just Like To ad My Pennies Worth,This vacuum cleaner really Does What everyone on this Site Say. My Wife(Christy)always Cleaning and She Thought her old Kenmoore Was Working Good. We Was Both in Best buy When I Saw they was now Selling Dyson over here. I'm From the U.K. and we have had this Vacuum over there For 10 years now and The Dyson is #1 there. We Got the Cleaner Home My Wife Used it and was Very Surprised how Much Dust this Thing Sucked up. My Wife Even Took the Dyson to her Mum's House and She was in Shock how much dirt she Had. Now she Owns one. Really the Lady From Va Should have Took more Notes to the Reviews here and Not consumer Reports and she would have been Loving The Cleaning Power. No I Don't Work for Dyson. The only thing we have in Common we are Both English. Happy Cleaning.
Little Power House  Just got this vacuum. I wasn't expecting a lot because of the price.....boy was I wrong! This is replacing a $400 canister vac. We have four labs and live in the Poconos so when they aren't bringing in ice balls ,it's pieces of slate or branches. This vacuum picks up dog hair, slate, wood pieces.....oh and bird seed( squirrels found the bird feeder)! The only down side is a short power cord and I have an extension cord to fix that!
Bagless Vacuum  This little vacuum does a great job and has all the controls and adjustments to do any job thinking of buying one for second floor.
Love it!  We were quite surprised when we received this vacuum.  It was nearly impossible to tell if it was new or refurbished and we were buying a refurbished vacuum.  It looked brand new and runs like new!  We would recommend this seller highly.
You'll Say "WoW"  Consumer Reports 2002 rated this vaccuum a BEST Buy.  I trusted them and bought this vaccuum. Now, I am very very pleased as I have never have had a vaccuum with this much power.  Everything about this cleaner is top notch. Our beachside house gets sooo much sand and sandy-dirt tracked in that most vaccuums just can't get it all. This vaccuum has exceeded all my expectations and has simply blown the others away. We have owned a hoover(left lots of sand behind) and the two phantoms (both new that broke: the first in 4 months then its replacement which broke in less than 6 months)before this one. I bought this one online after reading Consumer Reports because none of the local stores Wmart Tgt etc had it in stock. This Eurkeka is by far the best!!
Like many others who posted here  Like many others who posted here, I am disgusted by what was still left in my carpet from my old vacuum! Carpet looks like new again. Great vacuum!
Powerful little thing  It's powerful but a bit noisy. Noise is not my problem, though. It's also easy to clean, assemble and reassemble. The only thing I wish is the arm should be a little bit longer.
Miele Vacuums rock  I must say I love this vacuum. The choices of power settings are fabulous. Perfect for hardwood floors using the parkay attachment. My wife loves using it because it light weight and easy to operate. German engineering at it's best. Bravo.  Only negative. Short cord.
great sweeper!  I always used sweepers with bags, was skeptical at first. Test drove a friends Hoover& had to have one! It gets dirt that you can't even see, easy to handle, clean, works on every type floor& rugs. Well worth the money
Great item !!! accurately described and reasonably priced !!!
Great for people with pets  Bought this for my nephew who has a Husky. Amazing how much it picked up. Had an expensive Dyson but this seems to do the job with less cost.
This is a nice cleaner machine for tile floors  This is a nice cleaner machine for tile floors.  We purchased the online machine for less $$ than locally available.
Plug it in, turn it on, go get it.  I have no idea why there is a review for a vacuum cleaner here, but the fact is this fellow is a workhorse. I don't fuss much with machines and except for changing the bag regularly, this one has been exceptional in its performance without fuss. Best vacuum Ive ever had and that has included some expensive fancy names who did  not do or last as well.
Love it!!!!  Everything I wanted in a vacuum,it's easy to use, easy to clean,,easy to change attachments, I absolutely, am so happy with this vacuum!!
Cleans good at a great price!  I bought this Vacuum from Amazon for my mid 60s wife that has cancer of the lymph nodes and is a little weak from treatments. She wanted to do some of the house work and I didn't want her worn out pushing around a sweeper, so I bought the Hoover WindTunnel. It was delivered quickly and was easy to put together, and has some great features. The self-propelled feature makes the vacuum seem light weight even though it is a little heavier than her old unit, but we live in a single story house so weight is not an issue. The self-propelled part takes a little getting used to, as a hard push forward or pull backward makes it move quickly and it seems like it jerks a little, but once you give the soft touch to the handle is moves really easy. I have used it also to help out around the house and I like the fact that the brushes stop when the vacuum is in the upright position, the attached hose and attachments are on the sweeper (our old one did not have this feature and we had to go looking for them in the hall closet when we needed them)and the long cord allows for less unplugging to move around the house. The price is really good and the suction power is great. I don't think the light that tells you when you still have dirt in the carpet works very good, but I don't use it anyway. Great product.
Exceeded Expectations  I am the owner of 2 basset hounds, 1 cat, and 1 very messy Marine husband. We live in a 2400 square foot house that was built in 1939. Before this vacuum, I was using a shop vac to suck up all of the pet hair in my house (Yes, a shop vac. It's the only thing that had good enough suction power...).  So, after almost two years of using the shop vac, my husband told me he couldn't stand it any longer. Thus, we bought this beauty :) I wasn't expecting much. I was excited to test out the retractable cord, and eager to prove to my husband that no vacuum can suck up pet hair as good as a shop vac. He proved me wrong, BIG time. So, here are all the good things about this vacuum:  1. Rubber wheels. I have houseful of hardwood floors and previous vacuums had the plastic wheels that are noisy against bare floors. These wheels are made of rubber, which provides for a nice, quiet, easily maneuverable vacuum.  2. Suction. Man this thing has power! it does a better job that our shop vac did, and I was not expecting this at all. This vacuum gets everything from little gritty dirt bits (which I still don't know how they mysteriously appear) to the whopping balls of fur and shredded pet toys.  3. Hose power. The hose attachment has great suction too. I read several reviews about the hose being too short, but I disagree. I am used to extra long hoses on our shop vac, but the hose (with attachments) can reach the cobwebs on our 9-ft ceilings.  4. Retractable cord. Yes, it's as cool as it sounds. Here's a little tip: There's a little piece of yellow tape approximately 1 foot before you reach the end of the cord. This tape indicates that you should stop pulling. It's there to prevent you from pulling to hard and damaging the retractable mechanism.  5. Front handle. There's a handle that is on the front side of the vacuum which makes it really easy to carry up and down stairs. I also wasn't expecting this feature.  6. Consumer-friendly. Because our house is so old, I am surprised how well this vacuum has fit our needs. We have tons of little nooks and ornate structures in the house, and I have had no problem with this vacuum being able to reach any part of the house.  Now for the not-so-good:  1. The cord gets warm to the touch after approximately 30 minutes of non-stop use. However, it's not warm enough to be harmful to children or pets. I suspect it's because the vacuum uses so much power.  2. It's a little heavier than I expected. (This tends to mean it is built better than cheaper, flimsier vacuums, but I would not suggest this vacuum for an elderly person or someone who can't put out the extra muscle to carry it up and down stairs.)  Just remember that vacuums don't work on their own. There were several reviews of users that weren't happy that they had to move the hose attachments around on upholstery in order to gather all the pet hair. Well, yes, you do have to put forth some effort in order to get the results that you want! Overall, I love this vacuum. I am so impressed that I will stick to the Hoover brand for a very long time. I may even be guilty of spending more time with my vacuum than my husband ;) Not really, but it's that good.
Great product. works great for general use or when the dog urinates in the house
Love it. Named it Kevin  Love it.  Named it Kevin.  Use it all the time.
Excellent product
Awesome power
If you are looking for a compact vacuum, look no further  This little thing is perfect! I wanted a small vacuum without a bag to use to clean the tile in my home after our two furry children. This is perfect. The size is exactly what i was expecting! It will stash away easily in my closet. It is very easy to put together, love the self retracting cord, and it is very lightweight. It is obvoiusly made for small jobs, I did have to empty the canister after one room, but it is what I expected since it is so compact! LOVE!!
Great canister vac.  After having this vacuum for a couple months I can definitely say it's the best little vacuum I've ever owned! Doesn't lose suction, perfect for our hardwood,tile and rugs. Easily goes under beds, tables etc. Best of all the price is unbelievable. Highly recommend.
Excellent vacuum! I have two, one for each floor. Great value too!
What a "sucker"!  This product really cleans up.  I have used the carpet nozzle on my very good cannister for several years.  It did a good job but several things needed to be replaced and that would have been costly.  While lying on the carpet, I noticed bits and pieces that shouldn't have been there after vacuuming.  I researched vacuums and this Tempo was highly rated by several sources (including Consumer Reports).  I was a bit dubious that such an inexpensive machine could be as good as it's PR but thought it was worth a try.  The suction is so strong, it actually leaves vacuum marks in my Berber carpet.  I use an extraction shampooer regularly.  The solution it picks up is less mucky than it was when I used my previous vacuum.  The Tempo is pretty noisy but it more than makes up for that with it's cleaning power.
Very pleased.  Best vacuum I have purchased. Extremely quite. Works great. The head is narrow and fits well under furniture and because the hose is a good length I can clean under the bed thoroughly.
Miele Eclispe  I purchased from ABT because no one could match the $399 price tag and free shipping they were offering. Everyone else had this vacuum listed at $579(I wonder if ABT made mistake?). The Miele Eclipse is perfect for my 1900sq ft. house. I have hard floors except in the bedrooms. I bought the Miele SBB400-3 XL Parquet Twister Floor Tool. It's 16 inches wide and the suction reaches to the edges(suction power is outstanding). It covers a lot of area fast. I bought the 10ft hose extension to add to the current hose. I hardly have to move the vacuum in each room. It's like having a central vac. I have brick floors so no vacuum rolls good on my floors. Although this vacuum rolls better than any other vacuum I've tried. It's quiet even on full power compared to any other vacuum. I also bought the miele accu nova rechargeable power head. It does very well on carpets and the batteries last longer than I imagined. It comes with two batteries. It took me 3 to 4 times of vacuuming 3 bedrooms with carpets before the one battery dies. I like having the rechargeable head because the hose is lighter due to no wiring. The only complaint I have is that the miele should include one of the parquet attachments with their vacuums. A must if you have hard floors.  Accessories I Recommend 10ft hose extension. hardly have to move vacuum. Miele SBB400-3 XL Parquet Twister Floor Tool covers big areas fast. It's 16inches wide. Miele SAB 100-3 Accu Nova Electro Brush
Couldn't be more pleased, especially for such a great price  Works extremely well! It is moves well and has strong suction. Couldn't be more pleased, especially for such a great price!
Bissell Clean View Upright is alright by me!  Used this on my berber carpet and loved the way it picked up the ground in particles that my bigger, bulkier sweeper couldn't touch! Love it, and will keep you updated on the durability of it. So far, so good!
Like the detachable canister.  We like the detachable aspect and ability to carry/use the canister when vacuuming stairway and when doing cars in the garage. Overall this vacuum does a good job.
I was in the market for a REALLY good vacuum cleaner  I was in the market for a REALLY good vacuum cleaner, and when Consumer Reports rated this so highly, I HAD to try it! They are right on the money!  This is an AWESOME vacuum for the money.  It ranks up with the $400.00 vacuums in power and suction.  What I love about it is the ease of the attachments. You get the main attachments that you really need to use, and they STAY ON the vacuum during vacuuming.  On other pricer vacuums that I have owned, the attachments fall off easy, and others you have to keep in the bag. This vacuum is so user friendly with the attachments easily accessible and secure.  I have a cat and a dog, and the suction is truly comparable to the high end models that I have owned.  I wish you had a 10 star option, because that is what I would give it!!
After having a dinosaur like the Kirby for 15 years-and it weighed as much as my car!-this vacuum is light, and is super efficient on hardwoods and rugs.  I like the feature that allows you to turn down the motor so you can use the beater bar on throw rugs without sucking them up into it!  I also took it to my son's home for him to try and he really seemed to like everything about it.
Quiet, powerful, compact.  Just what we needed to replace a heavy upright.
It works great and is so easy,do they make one for carpets?
Thanks for your review of Kuchenprofi 1068002800 Extra-Long 12-Inch Tweezer Tongs in 18/10 Stainless Steel
Great vacuum for the cost!
Great Vacuum  Wow! This vacuum really cleans well. It was embarrassing to see just how much "stuff" this vacuum found in my carpet after I had already cleaned the carpet with my old vacuum. This machine proved itself in the first five minutes of use and my old vacuum went straight into the garbage. It's very quite and the dirt disposal door is very convenient. I really like everything about this machine.
this is a great vacuum and its cheaper on amazon then it is locally
compact and powerfull
A 'dream' machine with frightening results in how much dust and grime it can suck out of clean-looking carpets  The Dyson multi-floor edition is the first Dyson we've owned.  I will echo the sentiment of other reviewers -- it is frightening just how much dust it pulls out of a carpet well-vacuumed with other older vacuums.  The mobility of the ball design is quite handy, and the product feels very modern in its attachment design and assembly.  Overall it feels very sleek and somewhat delicate - it isn't a monster you can carelessly bang around worn baseboards and expect it to operate or look as nice as it comes; but it is an excellent choice for its price range.
runs as stated...very nice
We are a Miele family  We have two homes and this is our 3rd Miele in 16 years.  WE bought our first one 16 years ago and have always been impressed with the performance of Meiel vacuum cleaners.  They are consistently high performance machines.  This is the "lowest grade" model we've ever bought and though we miss having a storage compartment for the attachments we enjoy that it's lighter than the other models we've had in the past.  It has the exact same suction ability as our more expensive version.  We simply love it!  You can not go wrong buying any of their vacuum cleaners.
Doing bare floors again  Have no idea what happened to the one that came with the vacuum but the power head just doesn't do a good job on bare floors and as I don't like to sweep because it leaves to much dust behind I use this all the time so I can get all the dust off my bare floors between mopping's. It's not the same color as the original but does the same job.
Works great
Light easy to use  Love my Bissell great for spots on carpet
Just what I needed!  This vacuum works really well transitioning between area rugs and hardwood floors.  It also does a great job picking up the dog hair (coarse medium length hair)! The powered attachment works great on vacuuming the couches.  Only drawback when compared to my old vacuum, is that I wish the power cord was a little bit longer.  Otherwise,  great machine!
Terrific Vacuum; Great Performance.  I had been using a $30 stic-vac (basically a glorified dustbuster parading as a vacuum) in my one-bedroom apartment, rationalizing that since the floors are hardwood, I didn't need a full vacuum just for the four area rugs spread out between the living room and the bedroom.  I "vacuumed" my rugs every week or two for two years.  I noticed that while the stic vac performed great on hardwood, it couldn't even touch the lint, hair, etc. that got stuck in the medium pile of my rugs.  The rugs started to look old and dingy, which I chalked up largely to traffic and the sooty NYC air.  When I finally bought the Shark, I ran it over my ivory-colored area rug, and it quite literally brought the rug back to life.  I know it's cliche to say it looked "like new," but that's honestly the best way to describe it.  I have an 8 x 10 living room rug and two 5 x 7 rugs in the bedroom (so not a lot of surface area), and this vacuum almost filled the canister with dust and lint after the first pass.  I could not believe how much was there that had been missed by my stic-vac.  The brush is powerful enough to almost propel the vacuum by itself, digging deep into the pile, and it keeps great suction.  Emptying the cannister is easy once you figure out which latch controls which compartment (there are a lot of buttons you can press - read the manual).  The one drawback is the clear cannister.  It looks great when you open it new, but once you've used it once, there's no hiding what's inside or what WAS inside once you've emptied it.  Definitely not an issue that merits deducting a star.  I'm very happy with the vacuum especially at this price point.
Very Happy  I have a Eureka wind tunnel bagless vacuum. We have 2 dogs and 3 cats, which needless to say produces lots of hair. Add to that we live in the country and my husbands work boots bring in lots of dirt and dust. With my \Eureka bagless I would have to empty the cup 4-5 times for just one room. It did not matter if I vacuumed every day or once a week. Plus the filters would get clogged and then you would have to take the vacuum apart,wash them, let them dry and then put them back. I decided i was time for a new vacuum with a bag. When I first got married years ago I inherited an old Hoover upright and it worked like a charm and lasted I don't know how long. So I decided to try a Hoover for my new one.  I have only had this vacuum for a few weeks, but so far I love it. in. I hated to vacuum because it took me forever. Now I am done in 10 minutes, don't have to stop to empty the bag, no clogged filters and the carpet looks great.  Do I wish the hose was a little longer? Yes, but I can still do what it need to. Wider bottom means more carpet is  covered in less time. Nice long cord and the needed extra attachments make it a great choice for me. Would like it if it was a bit sturdier and not make of plastic, but I can live with that. As of right now I would definitely recommend this vacuum
Life changing!!!!  We do dog rescue and the floors are always an issue. This has been live changing. Easy to use, gets the floors clean and isn't a hassle. Totally life changing!!!!
Love  Fast shipping.  Love it
I should have purchased sooner!  I have been watching Craig's list for a dyson and finally decided this was new for less than a used dyson.  I am very, very happy with it.  I only wish I had purchased it sooner.  I have had an oreck for the last 12 years and for the last three, it just hasn't been right.  Not to mention how expensive the bags were.
Like it so far.  I have no idea how it's going to do in the future, but for now it is doing great. Happy so far.
Best vacuum cleaner ever!  I have owned many vacuum cleaners over my adult life, and this is far and away the best one I have ever owned.  It has tremendous suction and cleaned my carpeting (wall to wall and area rugs) so much better than my 4-5 year old comparable upright vacuum.  My husband and I are amazed at its effectiveness!!  It was extremely easy to assemble (attach the handle with 3 screws).  The first bag was already installed.  Unlike some others, I did not have any problem with the handle release pedal.  The ONLY complaint I have is that this vacuum cleaner is almost too powerful to use on accent rugs (smaller than 4' x 6')--you really have to be careful, because the suction will lift even fairly good sized accent rugs off the floor and into the brushes.  I accidentally damaged a very small entryway rug before I learned my lesson.  (...)
Excellent, It's so light weight and cleans like a dream.
Great machine --light and picks up better than most other machines I've had.
Great Vacuum for Pet Owners  I've had my eye on a similar Dyson for about a year, but just can't validate spending that much on a vacuum. I thought I was settling when I purchased this bad boy at a fraction of the price, but was pleasantly surprised.  My main issue with vacuums is usually their inability to stand up to the mountains of dust and dog hair that I have in my house. This machine conquers through our mess like a champ! I was pretty disgusted how much hair and dirt this thing picked up after my other vacuum the first time I used it. which is very sad since I used to vacuum every day.  It is super user friendly and easy to operate. Very easy to transition from floor to attachment modes, and despite having only a couple attachments, I have yet to find a mess that the ones included don't clean. I especially like the little mini tornado of an upholstry attachement. It gets ALL of the hair off of my couches and dog beds.  I am so very pleased with this purchase. Dyson Smyson!!!
Fantastic product!  Fantastic product!!!  It's amazing on the carpets, quiet than most, and the pet grooming tool we purchased is just as amazing.  Love it!!!
light weight and easy to use  my mom loves it. light weight and easy to use, sucks up everything.
I love it. The suction is strong and pulls so much more dust and dirt from the carpet than my other vacuums ever did.
I love this vacuum  I love this vacuum! I love how it folds up nice as well as the push tab for the cord. It has been working well.
Wife is happy, so I'm happy.
Watch the cat hair disappear before your eyes!  Love this Bissell!  Have four cats and carpeting throughout the home.  In small area in dining room and one pass through living room and Wallaaaaa - canister full of cat hair.  And to think that I thought my replaced vacuum cleaner was doing a good job.  Made a huge difference in the smell of the room as well as the air quality.  I am just a happy little camper!
This product sucks...in a good way!  Great vacuum. better for residential application but also does well in hotel application.
A very nice vacuum. Long power cord ,goes nicely under furniture
boundry marker  does what its supposed to do mark off areas i don't want the vac to go. Nice long roll so had plenty to spare.
She says it works great is lightweight and easy to move around  This was a gift for my mom. She says it works great is lightweight and easy to move around.
By far the best vacuum I have ever used  OK. Here's the short version. This thing is very powerful; it's quiet; it's light; it has incredible filtration, especially if you add the HEPA filter; and both the parquet twister and the electro comfort power head are just about the best tools ever on a vacuum cleaner for cleaning bare floor or rugs and carpet respectively.  For the long version, please see my full review posted under the newer version of this product:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Miele-S6270-Topaz-Canister-Vacuum-Cleaner-Tayberry-Red/dp/B00BDAOA84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Miele S6270 Topaz Canister Vacuum Cleaner, Tayberry Red</a>
Amazing! Great suction power. We love it!
Awesome. Light. Easy to assemble and use. Very powerful.
Nice
Little big vacume  This one is lighter than the old models but still same great suction.
For the price, a great vaccum... Almost too good.  Twenty years ago I bought a Sebo.  That was the best vacuum I have ever owned.  It finally broke and it was time to replace it.  I wanted to buy a Sebo again, but it was beyond my current price point.  I bought this vacuum with no expectations.  My wife use to do the vacuuming, and lets say she is a great wife but not such a good clearer. This vacuum has is a sensor that tells you when the carpet is dirty and it took a while for that sensor to turn green.  I vacuumed up almost a full bags worth of dirt before the dirty carpet sensor went off.  I replaced the bag and vacuumed once a week and the light, for the most part, stayed green.  All of a sudden, the vacuum stopped working.  It just shut off.  The bag was completely full.  I replaced the bag, waited 20 minutes, turned it on and it started cleaning my floor again.  This thing picks up more dirt than I could have imagined.  So much that YOU NEED TO CHECK THE BAG more often than you think.  It's a great vacuum, and at 6th of the price of a Sebo... it can't be beat.  This is the second best vacuum I've ever owned.
Great suction. Hose pretty stiff. Cord does get warm to hot.
Awesome Affordible Vacuum!  Wow! This thing is pretty awesome!  In response to the complaints I have seen: 1. If you don't like cord length, buy an extension cord or... use a different plug. More cord = more to roll up when you're finished!  2. Canister issues? I empty mine after every room, near a trash can. Is this a bad thing? NO... That means the thing is sucking up so much dirt, dander & hair that you have to! Bigger canister = heavier vac!  3. Your vacuum stopped working after 1 year? Well, hmm... It has a 3 year warranty! Call them, and have them fix it!! (Or, try cleaning the thing.)  I don't see what people are complaining about. The thing is cool, it works great and is affordable! Quit nit picking for goodness sakes.  Hope this helps those of you with doubts!
Cleans mud great!  So we recently moved and our new house is not landscaped in the back yard yet. Needless to say our dogs have found every mud puddle there is and are in the process of turning our home into a dirt floor cabin. We tried using swiffer but all that did was move the mud around evenly. 5-6 pads was still not enough. I ordered this and it arrived today. We can now see our clean, shiny floors again and no grit residue. I know some have complained about the motor burning out. I don't know if that will happen but it comes with a factory 2 year warranty and I purchased aother 2 years of protection through Asurion at check out. I am extremely happy with the performance of this cleaner and the dogs will have to find another way to irritate us.
Great Vaccum  This is a very good canister vac.  Everything that 5 star reviews say.  Really great on hard wood floors.  I you have a lot of carpet buy attachment for carpets.
Just whatt I needed  This vacuum is quite impressive in terms of its power, effective sunction and ease of use. I don't have to deal with messy bags any more and it can pull out dirt even from areas I just vacuumed with my old machine!!
Never going back to a dustpan!  Got one for Christmas and Im in LOVE!!!
2nd best is still first.  One step below their top rated unit, but still an excellent performer, and less expensive.
LOVE THE VACUUM!  I LOVE the Cordless Air; it performs beautifully! Short of having someone else do the vacuuming, it's the BEST! But after a year and a half, one of the wheels came off and cannot be reattached. Per Hoover warranty supervisor, in order to get repair or replacement, two trips to warranty center are required. After dealing with corporate (another level of supervisors), Hoover stepped up and once I provided needed warranty info, they sent a brand new model (more recent than one I'd purchased). So Hoover customer care stepped up and I got the warranty replacement without undue hassle. Thank you, Hoover!
So I bought two more one for my daughter and for my daughter in-law got to keep the girls happy no.  Bought one for my wife she loves it,light weight and cleans the floor what else do you need. However my daughter started using it, she was impressed with it and uses in daily. So I bought two more one for my daughter and for my daughter in-law got to keep the girls happy no.
Great suction
just great product
Makes cleaning fun!  Very well constructed. Makes cleaning fun!
Great vacuum. Self propel feature is nice.
I am cery impressed with the cleaning power of this machine.  I was disgusted to see how much dirt and other things were left in my carpet from my previous vacuum. Very impressed.  Great furniture attachment as well.
Great Vacuum  We purchased this vacuum several months ago and are amazed at how much dirt and animal hair it collects everytime we clean the floors and carpets. It is easy to empty, and the 2 cleanable filters are very easy to clean. We haven't changed the HEPA filter yet, it recommends changing that every 6 months, but we'll probably change it every 3-4 months.  It is the standard weight for this style of cleaner, and the detachable cannister makes cleaning the stairs so much nicer. Our toddler son, who was afraid of our last upright, loves this vacuum!
Good vacuum  Hoover has been making this style of machine for quite a while, which itself says that it works well.  I have one that is about 13 years old.  I was very hard on that one, using it to clean up remodeling debris as well as general use, and it still works well (but looks like hell).  I saw this version, "remanufactured" at Frys for $69, and thought I would take the risk.  The "remanufactured" one looks absolutely brand new with no signs of being used, and it works great - just like my old one.  This style of vacuum has a GREAT suction and some very nice features, but you should be aware that it is very heavy due to being self-propelled.  Self-propelled makes it absolutely effortless to use on carpet. But if you have to lug your vacuum up stairs, this one is very heavy. Get a lighter model.  All modern vacuums from the major manufacturers are primarily plastic, including Dyson.  This has more of a retro look than one of the new space age looking models, but it has great cleaning performance and my experience is that it's rugged.  This is a bagged vacuum.  No one likes changing bags, but I think it's probably better than dumping out the bagless container and dealing with all that dust.  You can change a of bags for the difference in price between this and a $450 Dyson.  Honestly... bags are not really not much of a problem.  Taking a full bag out and dumping it is actually much less of a mess than dumping a bagless out.  Most people recommend emptying your bagless OUTDOORS to avoid a dust storm...  As far as performance, this type of Hoover really does the job.  It DOES lose suction as the bag fills up.  It has so much suction that it can afford to lose some and will still do a great job.  The way to use it is to NOT wait for the bag to be completely full.  Bags are cheap. Dyson is not.  My Hoover came with a 30 foot cord.  This is a practical consideration and makes life easier.  Very nice.  Cords are expensive, so many makers provide shorter cord.  I would check this on any vac before buying.  The Hoover self propelled feature works great.  But if you have a low nap carpet or hard floors, you don't need self propelled so I would get the cheaper model without it.  I actually turn the self-propelled off when vacuuming tile or hardwood. Get the self propelled model if you have a lot of carpet in a one-story home.  Otherwise, you can get a similar non-propelled model for less money.  The ball design on Dyson is clever, but think about it... is manueverabilty a problem with a non-ball design?  I wouldn't spend the money for that unless you think it is.  The "embedded dirt finder" on some of these Hoover models is one of my favorite features.  Yes I know it seems like a gimmick, but I find it works very well and helps.  You WILL be surprised at how much more time you need to spend over the "traffic lanes" in your carpet.  Without the dirt finder, you're probably not spending enough time on those traffic lanes, and after a while the carpet in the traffic lanes will show wear.  One thing I learned with my older Hoover is to vacuum until the light turns green (red=still dirty, green=no more dirt), then go over the same area in another direction.  It'll find a little more dirt (light will be red again for a few strokes) most of the time.  The hose detaches on this for the accessories, like many vacuums.  One problem with this model is that the hose is a little bit too short, even with the two extension wands.  It's a complaint with many uprights, not just Hoover.  My older one (from Costco or Price Club, can't remember which at this point) came with an extra length hose.  This hose makes a huge difference. - I recommend it if you plan to use the attachments much.  I can't compare it to others, and let's face it no vacuum will be quiet.  But this one is LOUD.  I attribute that the a powerful motor.  To me, more power means less time vacuuming so that's a tradeoff I will make.  I looked at all the others.  I like Oreck because it is made (mostly) in the USA.  But it's costly.  Dyson is well engineeered but crazy expensive and is still just a plastic vacuum despite the marketing hype.  I have had an(old) Electrolux and shared a house with a Kirby owner for years.  Neither of those had nearly the suction of this inexpensive Hoover, although both of them were extremely rugged.  Any of the newer plastic vacs won't last like a Kirby... This one has a good track record with me, though.
Quiet, Strong and Clean  Never had we paid so much for a vacuum. Have only had it  2 or 3 years but it keeps going strong and we still can't find anything wrong with it, except that the bags and filters are expensive. But the exhaust after the filters make it worth it.  We did the "Rainbow" light test on the exhaust and it was a clean as the "Rainbow". My 2nd favorite thing about it is the retractable power cord. It is fast, efficient, and has yet to tangle.  Next is the noise, it is so quiet that could even have the music playing at normal levels and hear fine. The grand-kids and pets don't run away or attack it.
bye bye dust bunnies!!  Love this product.
Even better than I hoped for!  We downsized recently and I didn't need several vacuums anymore, just one that could do ceramic, vinyl and a small amount of carpet, and a few floor rugs.  This little guys is so powerful yet on the handle and on the floor piece, you can easily adjust the amount of suction as you change types of flooring and just keep on going. The filters were reasonable but I found a better price directly from Eureka and ordered two of each.  If I had to say anything on the down side, it would be that the plastic seems a little fragile when I take it apart to clean.  So, I make sure I'm super careful. Still, I am so thankful for the reviews from others which helped me take a chance on this little vacuum.  It is absolutely perfect for all my needs.
Hoover FloorMate  Love it, love it, love it.  I read the reviews before I purchased it and I am glad I did.  This machine got dirt out of my floor that I did not know I had.  At first I did not think that it was doing anything but I notice the water was dirty so I told myself it is doing something.  When I finished and got up the next morning and looked at my floor, I said "Oh my God" the floor was amazing it looked like a brand new floor.  I was really impressed.  Great machine.
it easy to empty  Performs well, it easy to empty, and lightweight.
Very happy with this product
like it  like it. good price, light and  easy to use, long handle make you can clean under bed and the place which is hard to reach.
It's a Dyson, C'mon  Great Vacuum, worth the price I guess, haven't had any issues at all with the vacuum and it cleans as advertised, tons of attachments.  I would recommend getting a little bag or something to go with this to store all the attachments.
I have an indoor German Shepherd who sheds like crazy. This vacuum is wonderful  I have had this vacuum for quite a while now. I have an indoor German Shepherd who sheds like crazy. This vacuum is wonderful. My bedrooms are carpet and the rest of the house is tile. Its wonderful to be able to go through the whole house with one unit.
Great vacuum for the money  So far we've been very pleased with this product.  The cord recall feature has been working excellently and is a nice touch.  It seems to do an excellent job on the carpets and furniture, etc.  it could use some longer extention hoses to clean with the accessories it comes with but overall it's been a very nice little vacuum.
I LOVE this vacuum - and I have used a lot of vacuums  OK- let me begin by prefacing this review with the fact that I have reviewed MANY vacuums over the last few years. Dyson Cordless, Bissell upright for animals, Kenmore upright, get-rid-of-dust-mites & UV-killing light canister vacuums, etc. and this is my FAVORITE straight forward vacuum.  No, it doesn't come with any attachments, hoses, or fancy do-dads. No, it doesn't have a lever you can change a gazillions floor heights. And, no, it doesn't have a fancy headlight like all those suped up commercial vacuums... but you know what it has that trumps all of those other ones? IT SUCKS!  I mean totally and completely sucks up everything in its path. Watch out kitty cat, if your tail gets in the way you just might lose it when mama vacuums the family room this afternoon. Don't catch the edges of the drapes in this puppy or they may rip right off the rail. Seriously, this this vacuum is like a ShopVac gone household vac.  The side brushes on the unit make it easy to get near baseboards and not feel like you are going to scratch them up. The weight is solid, and feels like your grandmother's vacuum- well built and sturdy. But, the overall weight to lift it up/down stairs is minimal and really not an issue. The noise level is perfect. Not too loud, not a quiet hum that means the vacuum isn't even able to lift lint off the carpet. Easily transitions from our Berber to hardwood, to throw rugs with the duo-switch at the handle of the vacuum (low/high). I love not having to bend over to switch for floor changes. Easy in-out of the dirt catching bag, which you can throw away and not have fluff/cloud all over your house like the canister vacuums do when you remove them.  I have to say, with all the vacuums in my home, I am ready to pitch all the others and keep this one for my everyday home use to get a deep-clean of the carpets in a 4 family, long-haired dog and cat home. When I vacuum with this one, I am confident that it cleans the dirt and dust mites out of the rugs, not just throw them around in the air.
Thank you
This is an addition to my 1st and 2nd Review  1st Review:  It is solo quite. Perfect for a small house (580 sq ft). Excellent suction. And no more bags!  2nd Review:  I am responding to those who complained about poor suction. NOTE:  It is very important that you follow the instructions on how to empty the canister and to wash the black/white filter. Many of you are not washing it and that will result to low suction.  3rd Review: It is now 2/18/2016 I still give it a 5 stars. I have had it for a couple of years now and still pleased with it's performance. Just Remember to wash with water the black/white filter called Foam Filter #21191301 or #21191302.
Best Vacuum  Was wanting to purchase this for a long time as I had experience of them in the UK and family members use them back home also. I have the Dyson Animal and have been disappointed with it from the moment I plugged it in but have put up with it due to the high cost. Finally gave up and bought a nice pink Hetty and haven't regretted it a single bit, I actually enjoy vacuuming now - even the kids want to do their rooms!! I was personally fed up with expensive replacement parts on my Dyson, the main roller/carpet head was next to useless and was fed up inhaling dust and filth every time I had to empty the canister. Happy to go back to bags with Hetty, which last for ever {are also way cheaper in the UK!?} I have noticed no loss of suction due to bags - marketing crap from Dyson which I fell for.
performs as expected; quick delivery
One of the best purchases I have ever made!
Great  This vacuum is on sale at Costco for $349.99 from April 11, 2013 through May 5, 2013.  This is a great price for a great vacuum.
Hoover  Purchased this Hoover a few weeks ago and we are very pleased with the performance.  One of the best vacuums we've owned for the price.  No complaints.
A Vacuum Cleaner with Superior Performance, Light Weight, and Operates Very Quietly  Wow, this is truly a remarkable vacuum cleaner. It is my third Electrolux. The first was when I was a child, was built out of steel, and would have likely withstood running over by a car before damage (even the head was made of steel and aluminum, and the canister had no wheels, instead using the stainless steel "sleigh" design that you see on industrial vacs), and the second was (we still have it) the innovative "Oxygen" model which was, and still is, a highly impressive vacuum in terms of its cleaning power, overall design, HEPA filtering, and general ease of use.  This one, however, blows it away (no pun intended). At nearly only half the weight, this one works as well, if not better, than the Oxygen model, retains the HEPA filter, has a better electric beater bar, and comes with a much improved bare floor accessory that has a hinged assembly, wheels, and integrated fixed-bristle brush design. And QUIET ... this thing makes noise, but it's nothing like other vacs I've used, and you can even carry on a conversation while using it.  The design is exceptionally cute. It looks like a droid out of Star Wars, but if it didn't work well, that would not matter. The parts and assembly quality appear first-rate (mine is made in Hungary, and it feels and looks like a German-built device, just like the Oxygen one, which was built in the Czech Republic). A really nice and thoughtful design is that the handle assembly on the base can be used to pick up the vac to move to a different place in the room, but if you want to carry it up the stairs, you rotate the device 90 degrees, revealing an integrated handle that allows you to carry the device so that the center of gravity is much closer to your body, making carrying up and down the stairs so much easier than before. And, you can store the device on a shelf or other dedicated area using that same technique.  This thing pulls up dust and dirt like I've never seen before. Even the finest particles are captured, and when you are ready to dump the canister, you press the release button on the top of the device, and the whole front canister pops right off. A nice touch, the canister EASILY goes right back in place, something with which I've struggled with before on numerous other devices. This one goes back on every bit as easily as it comes off, and that means less frustration and less time wasted.  Both the power and the cord retractor are engaged by separate foot buttons on the base of the machine. And the cord retractor works very well. After about five years, the cord retractor on my Oxygen model went out, and replacing that part is well over $100, so I hope that will not be the case with this unit, but it works very well and gives no indication that it will fail early.  The brush head is powerful, has four depth settings for different types of carpeting and hard floors, has LED lights to illuminate well in front of what you are vacuuming, and indicator lights for the various position settings.  It's very quiet, very effective, very light, well designed, and built of quality parts. It's only half the price of some of the other European brands that are equivalent to it. How can it be rated as anything less than five stars? An amazing piece of equipment that looks as good as it performs. Vacuuming will never be fun, but this one gets you quite a bit closer to that illusive target ...
My daughter LOVES it!
Love it!
This vacuum is the best  I've only used it three times since purchase, but it seems to be the best that I've ever used before. I'm 63 years of age which should  tell you that I've been using vacuums a long time. It's light, agile and the suction is powerful. With the accessories its easy to get under the furniture ahd get that dirt. Very happy with the decision to buy this unit and very happy to buy it at Amazon, where the price was about 1/3 less than every other place that I looked.
this vacuum is fantastic!  I had a great pet vacuum that unfortunately died on me, and I was having a hard time finding another one that would be just as good, if not better. This one is better! This Hoover WindTunnel is so amazing, and I am so happy and my carpet is grateful :)
Excellent vacuum.  This small vacuum has a lot of sucking power. Very light.  I do not recommend it for carpets however retracting the brush on the vacuum head allows for carpet use.
Harmony Ultra Quiet Lives up to its name  This is from the perspective of a work-at-home husband who used to go crazy when his wife was vacuuming. I am barely aware that she is vacuuming in my office when I am on a business call!  This machine is incredible.  My wife loves it because it is much more powerful than our previous vac.  She only needs to make one sweep as opposed to multiple passes to pick up everything - and that is on the low-power setting.  Small footprint for storing; light; agile; and well made.
Highly pleased with product. Amazon.com as usual, 5 stars.
Great Product  Left my floors super clean and shining. I love it.
This vacuum cleaner is awesome it sucks everything right up did my daughters room and shes just getting ready to crawl i feel much better knowing the floor is clean
This is the best Vacuum for many reasons  This Bissell 3920 is simply the best Vacuum device I have ever owned. Its a huge upgrade from whatever I had before. Powerful cleaning power you can see as you reach for pet hair everywhere around the house. The hose is long enough and extends even more with all the neat accessories included in this set. You will use them all with ease and since its weight distribution is brilliant you will be less tired then when you cleaned with your old vacuum. The first time you use it you will be amazed at how much cleaner the carpet is and if you prepare the house for deep cleaning you can use this Bissell to pick up everything you see. Felt like you are doing a Television Ad for them in your home since this is all around the most exceptional vacuum you owned.
Hoover WindTunnel Canister Vacuum, Anniversary Edition, Bagged, S3670  A great machine my wife just had to have and now never uses. It is very nice just not as easy to use as the old upright ones.
Finally, a real vacuum cleaner for under $140  Got this item recently, finally got to use it in earnest and it rules. Did our bedroom today and got rid of dust and fuzz I couldn't believe was there--the Power Paw accessory is excellent. It's got a spinning brush head which is like a mini vacuum cleaner on an extension handle so you can get everything under your very awkward to move bed without having to move it. It's also the most powerful vacuum cleaner I've ever used. Highly recommended.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Eureka-4870MZ-Boss-Smart-Vac-Upright-HEPA-Vacuum-Cleaner/dp/B0015ASJIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Eureka 4870MZ Boss Smart-Vac Upright HEPA Vacuum Cleaner</a>
... IT & I HAD TO SAY HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS VACUUM  I JUST GOT IT OUT OF THE BOX & USED IT & I HAD TO SAY HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS VACUUM!! I used Amazon prime & was only without a vacuum for 2 days until this one arrived & I could not be happier!! I don't find it heavy or unwieldy at all as I have other vacuums. Used a Hoover as a child growing up & when I left home I was always trying whatever new & different fad vacuum that was popular at the time. I am so glad I went back to Hoover. A great price for a very good product!!
A Great Vacuum  This is a really great vacuum and the price is terrific.  I have seen it at Costco but it was less expensive to buy it at Amazon and at the time I had free shipping as well.  I always had Hoovers and I will not go back.  If you are looking for a great value, this is it!
works great and really picks up pet hair really well.
The best i"ve ever had!  Before committing to this vacuum, I did my research. I am extremely pleased with this one. True quality of workmanship, performance, and ease of use and upkeep. Have recommended it to several of my friends and family, and would recommend it to anyone!
Love it!  I am handicapped and using other vacuums just are to hard to work from my motorized chair. This vacuum is perfect. Emptying it is so simple. It is light and easy for me to maneuver. I Love It!
Amazing on Pet Hair
I love this NV 70 vacuum  I love this NV 70 vacuum. The suction is fantastic. Love the swivel design. I also have the shark swivel lift away for the other house and love that too, only negative with the lift away it's top heavy and sometimes fells backwards if you're not careful. I wanted to get another NV 70 but they were out of stock. What took me 10 minutes to vacumm up dog hair on a burgundy rug with a horrible hoover now takes a few minutes with this shark. Don't get the cheap all purple shark vacuum non swivel the suction is nonexistent.  I hate hoover after they sold their business. I switched to shark and never had a vacuum with that much power.
This one in particular keeps me happy even in a large 2000+ sq ft  After a year it is still kicking butt!!  I remember long ago when I was first getting my own place, my landlord used to buy these cheap vacuums all the time and I never understood it. After 10 years of messing with bagless, expensive, vacuums, I finally understood. These bagged vacuums are cheap, and work very well. This one in particular keeps me happy even in a large 2000+ sq ft. home. I am only writing this because I do love it that much. I used to hate vacuums with a passion and couldn't wait to toss them in hopes of something better. If this were to break, I'd fix it, or replace it with the same one. It's THAT good.  The only negative things about it are the hose attachment not being super great, and the cord is pretty short. But in reality, I'll take those over the pain of where I came from.  Seriously, stop reading and buy thing and move on with your life.!
Great for Pet People  Tried to find an affordable HEPA vacuum and this one is it!  I have pets and usually vacuums start to smell after several weeks from dander and this one doesn't after about a year.  It's lightweight and easy to use.  Just love it!
Love, love, love this vacuum!
I usually find vacuuming to be one of my hum drum daily chores, but today I got this vacuum and found myself actually smiling as I used it.  I was a little disgusted when I saw how much dirt and hair was in my carpet.  When I was done it looked as if my carpets were professionally cleaned.  I highly reccommend it!!!!!!!!
Hoover Floormate, lifesaver!  Surely counts down scrub time on hardwood floors.
Easy empty, powerful vac!  Very nice powerful little vacuum.  Great for my small apt.  Would withstand other household use in my opinion.
Easy to empty and clean  Amazing vacuum for an apartment! Does the job, easy to empty and clean. I like that it rotates because it makes it light weight and you can into all the little nooks and crannies.
I just received my Eureka Airspeed one its owesome, I vacuum my bedrooms can't belive how much dust and other thing my carpets were hiding, definitely gets 10 stars. Even that materials are not a great quality just needs to be carefully about that its fragile. The suction is awesome first time got more than 2 pound's in dirt from the carpet. Love that person that make my shipment add a message.
Light and easy to pull around  Very quiet.  Can use the same tools and wands I've been using for many years.  Light and easy to pull around.
Does a great job!  I love this floor cleaner!!! The dirty water goes into a separate reservoir on the side so it is not mixing with the clean water.
great suction and light weight
!!! Awesome Vacuum!!!  This is an AWESOME vacuum cleaner and I HATE to vacuum!  The vac originally came with a small piece broken off; apparently it was damaged in transit.  I e-mailed Amazon and they immediately shipped a replacement that arrived in less than a week.  Return of the original vacuum was virtually hassle free.  Having said that, I was amazed by the results when I first used the vacuum. Our carpet is 9 years old and after two dogs and a string of children, the texture of the carpet reminded me of felt.  Not much pile left, I thought.  UNTIL I used this vacuum.  I was amazed; I actually started seeing vacuum tracks again!!  The carpet looks and smells better than it has in years.  I have never seen such a difference with any vacuum cleaner that we've owned.  I usually just went through the motions of vacuuming since I really couldn't see that much difference in the before and after.  Now, I just love how much better the carpet looks, smells and feels after I vacuum!  One other note, this vacuum isn't as heavy or big as my old vacuum so I really don't see the size and weight as a problem, contrary to some of the other reviews that I read.  You need to buy this vacuum!  I feel like I've discovered the 8th Wonder of the World!
Love love love
A good vacuum.  Light but powerful.
great product  I had one of these before. It was 2 1/2 yrs old and quit working. I tried to have it fixed but the repair would have been more than the vacuum was worth. I decided to purchase the Wind Tunnel again since the replacement warranty is now available. This Wind Tunnel is way more powerful and better made than the one I had before. I am very pleased and would not hesitate to recommend it to others. Caroline
BAGS  sugested bags do not fit the oreck quest..you will need PK12CM1000..had to return bags..got the right ones from oreck direct
I thought my carpets were clean...I was wrong!  I lost all faith in my current vacuum after I started to use a new carpet cleaner around the house. Even after vacuuming I would still get a lot of pet hair stuck in the brushes of the cleaner so I had a good idea that my current vac wasn't getting the job done. This product said it had "OnePass Technology--with powerful suction and innovative brush design--that cleans on the initial pass" which sounded like a solution to the pet hair being left behind. Keep in mind that this isn't a Dyson and costs far less so I keep a "OnePass" claim in perspective...but I can take 3+ passes to get the job done I just wanted something better than what I had.  First off this is very easy to assemble out of the box. You need to attach two screws then the rest is just attaching the hose, tools, and power cord. The light weight of the product is evident when its all put together which is a plus  if you have to haul  it around the house. Despite its light weight it feels solid and it doesn't have a cheap feeling.  What I wanted to do was use my old vacuum on a spot  of carpet where my dog likes to lay and sleep. Shes a Lab and if someone says Labrador don't shed well Id tend to disagree! So I went back and forth over it 10 times with the old vac then plugged in the Bissell and ran it over the same area two passes. This was a couple feet of carpet and still there was a mass of pet hair along with a little bit of dirt. So not only was my old vac unable to get out the hair which I figured was tough when it got into the carpet, but it wasn't even able to get  out dirt. This vac is also so much quieter, not that sound was much of an issue but the difference between this one and my old one was so pronounced I had to mention it. So I went over the rest of the carpeted rooms, rooms that were cleaned a couple days ago, and when I was done I had to test out the the method to clean out the dirt container which while easy is also a great way to throw a lot of dirt into the air so I suggest doing that outdoors.  To use the tools you remove one end of the hose then attach the tools to the end of the hose. Your limited by the length of the hose as far as where you can get with the tools but the hose seems fairly long. The light weight of the vac makes it easy to fall over if you stretch the hose too much so its a good idea to keep the vac pretty close to you while using the tools. Nothing revolutionary with the tools they are the basics that come with any vacuum.  One thing that I do wish they would of had is the power switch located on the handle, the power is located on the side of the machine and while its not hard to use I thought its a lot easier with it located on the handle but that's just a personal preference. That's about as critical I can be really. As I said this isn't a Dyson so being picky about every feature of lack of feature isn't an apples to apples comparison. For the record the vac I have been comparing this to is this one&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Hoover-WindTunnel-Bagless-Upright-Vacuum-UH70105/dp/B002OQB4JE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Hoover WindTunnel Bagless Upright Vacuum, UH70105</a>and Id consider it similar in features and price range.
10 stars if i could!  i don't know why i waited so long to get this miracle machine. When my mom got sick we took over her little shitzu who happens to be a nervous pee'er so although we took her out she would still manage to pee in our litchen floor, doggy pads didn't work because she would chew them up. so we got a swiffere and while it did the job in quick clean ups it was not sanitized. so we got the bissel steam mop, i like it but not for this problem, and it adds when i have to mop up the mess the steam clean since otherwise the pee would get on th emicrofiber pad and well you can imagine. At costco the other day i saw this machine witha $20 coupon so for $100 i went for it. Let me tell you this thing is amazing. it came with 3 different cleaners. one for wood floors one for gout $ tile and one for everyday cleaning. Th vacumn works well for little pieces that may have been left behind but iwouldn't use it to vacum the whole area, not because it won't work but because i would rather vacum with our dyson really well and then use this to "mop" I used the tile & gorut and our floors look brand new! not sticky film left behind like with the swiffer, not wetness to wait on before going into the room again like with the bissell, I didn't even have to use the dry feature on this machine. i love how the dirty water is kept in a separate container. and speaking of water you can actually see how it sucks up all the filth off your floors. I guess my only gripe with this is the water/cleaner compartment is small so for a large area you would probably have to refill a couple of times, but small price to pay for spotless floors. oh did i mention the cleaner smells fresh and not "chemical-y" like other harsh cleaners do?! Our floors look amazing and new and with a baby walking all over this was perfection. yes its a tad bulky and i can't imagine having to lug it up and down floors(i would if i had to but i can see it becoming a nuissance) but it tucks fine in our closet and i love it. can't say enough good things about this machine! get it if you can and even at $130 its not a bad deal for the results you will get, especially if yoi have prime membership.
Get one Now!!  Seriously, get one now. You won't be disappointed. I used to use a Swiffer, which did a good job, but this does a better job. It actually picks up crumbs and dog hair that the Swiffer always left behind. It's like two great products combined into one. I like that the the handle flips either way, so I can vaccum first or use the Swiffer part first. When it gets full the dust cup is really easy to epmty. The battery seems to last about 12-15 minutes, which is long enough for what I use it for. I am definitely a satisfied customer.
I wera it out and it keep on doing it's thing  Best I have ever had
I love this! I saw so many bad reviews so it made me a bit hesitant at first. I haven't had any issues. I use it everyday. I like how it sucks up the liquid very quickly and dries it up in the process. I've had some dried stains and it washed and scrubbed then very quickly.
Easy to assemble, good to use  There are only 4 screws to put into the handle to fully assemble this vacuum cleaner out of the box. Then just remove the temporary tab that locks the on switch and start cleaning. True, this unit is not one of those high-priced, supposedly-never-loses-its-suction cleaners, but for the price is more than does an excellent job. Large debris is caught in one side of the clear, middle plastic case, and fine dust is caught on the accordion filter. Finally a HEPA filter catches anything else that gets past the accordion filter. Cleaning the filter box can get messy. Be sure you are outside when you knock the dust out of the accordion filter--and keep the wind to your back. Just tap the accordion filter and you'll be amazed at all the dust you used to breathe when you vacuumed with your old vacuum cleaner.
Cleans well
dyson dc25 ball vacuum  this vacuum is amazing. it picks up everything on every surface and the house has never seemed so clean. the bagless dirt catcher is really easy to empty, it's very light and i love the on-board tools. the only little issues i have  are that the swiveling action of the ball makes my elbow sore after awhile, and the hose extension is a little stiff so you have to pull it hard to reach up to the ceiling or behind furniture.
Solid product  Great for hardwood floors. It takes me 10 mins to vacuum by entire 2000 sq ft home.
They loved it and it was very easy to set up  I bought this as a bridal shower present. They loved it and it was very easy to set up.
This vacuum SUCKS like no other!  The WindTunnel Air(tm) Bagless Upright by Hoover sucks up more than any vacuum I've owned. I LOVE that it is lightweight, easy to use, and is SO powerful! I actually tried using my old vacuum on an area and then went over it with the WindTunnel Air(tm) and it is if I had never even vacuumed that area before! It sucked up SO MUCH dust, dirt, and animal hair that I could not believe I had vacuumed it already. Just think of the dirty house I have been living in! YUCK!  I have two kids, three pets, and live near the beach. Just think of the pet hair, sand, dirt, and crumbs I need to clean up on a daily basis. Having the WindTunnel Air(tm) Bagless Upright by Hoover makes life so much easier. It is SO lightweight which makes getting it up and down the stairs a piece of cake. The attachments are also wonderful. The tube extends so you can get high to reach places, and the attachments are slim enough to get small corners quite well.  This is by far the best vacuum I've owned to date. I am super pleased with the power, durability, and ease of use with this vacuum. My kids even love it! They are ages 5 and 8 and can help me clean now. They think it's a game and love helping mom! They actually fight over who can vacuum next. And yes, it is lightweight enough that kids can even use it (and have fun with it too)!  Cleaning it out is also a breeze! You just dump everything out and wash out some areas when needed. No bag is a definite PLUS! Another thing I love is that you can use it on many surfaces. We have a mix of carpet, hardwood floors, and tile. It works on ALL surfaces perfectly! I HIGHLY recommend the WindTunnel Air(tm) Bagless Upright by Hoover to anyone in the shop for a lightweight and powerful vacuum.  I received a sample of this product to facilitate my review, but my opinions are entirely my own.
Powerful vacuum  This is the best vacuum that I have had.  It is powerful, not overly loud, and the rubber wheels are nice because they let you move the vacuum around easily without making a bunch of noise on hard floors.  Some of the attachments have rubber or silicone paddles instead of a typical brush, and this picks up cat hair great.  I vacuumed my carpet with this vacuum after vacuuming with my old one, and the Hoover sucked up all kinds of dirt and fuzz from my supposedly clean carpet, which was disturbing, but good. Emptying the dirt cup is a bit messy, but nothing is perfect. Overall a great vacuum.
Worth the price.  Yes, it's expensive, but it's worth it. Clearly designed by engineers who's guidance wasn't "how cheap can we make this thing and get away with it". It works great
NIce vacuum  Second AirSpeed for me, first one was damaged by a grandson. Easy assembly, quality parts, good power, easy cleaning. With care, should provide years of good cleaning.
Machine does all the hard work!  No more mop scrubbing! Machine does all the hard work and it's easy to maneuver!
Great vacuum cleaner!  Love love love it! The suction is incredible and it's not too clunky. Perfect for a small apartment!
Nice Vacuum Cleaner  The remanufactured DC17 Animal we purchased was indistinguishable from a new one.  Our previous vacuum cleaner was a Hoover that we purchased about eight years ago.  It seemed to be doing a reasonably good job, but the self-propelled feature was giving us problems.  We have a large white dog that sheds a lot, and we had to replace the bag on the Hoover after vacuuming the house about four times.  We received the Dyson the day after we had vacuumed with the Hoover.  I unboxed the Dyson and tried it out in the living room and was shocked by how much dog hair and dust it picked up.  The Hoover obviously needed replacing.  Some reviews say the Dyson could be easier to handle.  I found this to be completely untrue.  Our Hoover was self propelled and the Dyson is just as easy to use.  The Dyson is also helping to fluff up our carpet which is about five years old.  The carpet is looking newer each time we vacuum.  Downsides are the part that actually vacuums the floor (don't know what it's called) is higher than most other uprights so it doesn't fit under low furniture and low beds.  The vacuum comes with an attachment that can get under very low furniture.  Also, not all the attachments can be carried on the vacuum.  Only the crevice tool, brush, and one other tool can be carried on the vacuum.  It would be nice if the power brush or the low furniture tool could also be carried.  We like the vacuum very much and it does an outstanding job getting up pet hair, dust, and dirt.  It also does a great job brushing the carpet to keep it looking new.  The remanufactured model is definitely worth every penny.  Don't know if I would pay full retail even though it performs so well.
BEST EVER  YOU WON'T REGRET BUYING THIS GREAT MACHINE.  SO EASY TO USE AND INCREDIBLE CLEANING POWER!
No Hyperbole:This is the Best Vacuum I've Ever Owned  I bought this elsewhere but thought it was absolutely worth posting my review here since I buy more things on Amazon anyway.  No hyperbole: this is the best vacuum I've ever owned and I feel ridiculous being excited about a vacuum.  My wife and I have two dogs; one sheds a lot, one doesn't.  We've had two WindTunnel vacuums over the last ~7 years, one bagged and one bagless, and they were honestly kind of terrible. The bagged vacuum would fill up unbelievably fast just from the couch, living room rug and master bedroom (only carpeted room) and/or occasionally get clogged before even starting to fill a new bag and the bagless vacuum would almost instantly clog up and either overheat or require a small disassembly near the bottom of the hose to clear it out. I swear we don't have a layer of hair covering our home, those vacuums were just abysmal.  When we saw this model I decided to check out some reviews and they were glowing. Still pretty skeptical (but hopeful), we grabbed it and tried it the next day.  Holy hell, what a difference. This thing is a magician! Haha. The attachments are wonderful, the expanding hose seems to always reach just far enough, the LED attachment for small spaces is an absolute wonder, and this thing picks up INSANE amounts of dirt and hair that our previous vacuums couldn't even come close to.  I've never been excited about a vacuum before, so hopefully that says something. Ha.  If I had to find a complaint, it's that the brush attachment is incredibly loud. That's it, though. Everything else is marvelous.
Great deal on a great vacuum. Constantly sucking up stuff
Get this one!!!  I just bought this from walmart. It is awesome!!! I highly reccomend this vacuum. I have a Boxer and he sheds like crazy... this makes life so much easier!!
Dyson DC07 Purple - WOW WOW WOW  I just purchased a Dyson DC07 Cycle Animal Upright Vacuum, Purple.  I LOVE IT.  Talk about picking up dirt and cat hair and cat litter that gets dragged around!  This is the best Vacuum I have ever owned.  I am 59 and have been through quite a few Vacuum's.  Let me tell you, I almost croaked at the price but figured it must be good for that price so I went with my gut feel.  Boy, am I glad I did.  This is a wonderful Vacuum.
Bam, dust and dirt fix  If you live with a man with hobbies or have shedding pets, this vacuum is a must have. The vacuum is noisy but probably because it's effective. That said, while the noise will drive your pets off to the nearest exit, their hasty exit will shake any loose fur, making the whole vacuuming exercise that much more efficient.
Hoover WindTunnel Anniversary Upright Vacuum  This product was rated a best buy by Consumer Reports in 2010. It is everything as advertised. This unit has excellent power, effective bag filtration and my wife has no trouble using it with the self propelled feature. She has had two hip replacement surgeries.
SEVEN YEARS AND STILL GOING STRONG  Wow, i just looked at my original review of my Dyson Animal D07. It is dated August 5th 2004. We are ardent animal lovers (Not just the Dyson type) We had a German shepard dog and a Pembroke Corgi and two kids when we first purchased this machine. Now after seven years we have two Corgis and one child as the other left for college.  This machine is still functioning well. It never has had a hiccup. It was more money than other machines of its type but we have never had a machine last 7 years before.  Buy Dyson, you will not regret it.
This machine does exactly what I needed it to do.  I have white tile floors which show dirt.  I've tried mops & steamers.  Nothing worked as well and as effortlessly  as this did.
Excellent cleaning action  Excellent cleaning action.  Lightweight and easy to handle.  Extra long cord eliminates the extra moving from room to room.  Easy to empty and clean.
Extraordinary !!!!!!!!!!!!!  I would totally recommend this product ... there is such a strong suction.  The carpet appears new after vacuuming ... amazing!
Works very well for me. It feels like it has a self-propeller when you are moving forward and does not require pushing it. It pulls you along and makes you walk faster to keep up with its speed. The hight adjustment is good for transitioning between hardwood and carpeting.
Love Dyson vac  I bought the Dyson Low Reach years ago and is by far the best vacuum I have ever owned. I bought the DC25 Ball All-floor for down the shore. It is smaller and lighter than the low reach. It is so easy to maneuver around our small cottage. I use it on the hardwood floors and sisal rugs with ease of turning on or off beater bar. I have 2 labs and the cup fills each time I use the vac. The only down side is the cord is shorter and cup is a tad smaller than my 1st Dyson. I would highly recommend this vacuum...I also got the great deal of the day offer for 319.00!
Excellent  Value  This is an excellent product. We have had it for four days and have used it every day (Normal use is once per week). It has great suction and it is extremely quiet.  It has an extra long cord, easy to use attachments, and is well put together. The bags and filters are easy to change and it comes with an extra belt and five extra bags! What more could you want from a vacuum? The salesman tried to steer me towards a Dyson with the "You will spend a fortune on bags". I had to remind myself that he is on commission and makes so much more on a $400 model than a $140 model.
Best vacuum on the market  When my husband bought me this Dyson, I was thrilled.  I am still excited and thankful for it.  To describe its cleaning ability and suctioning power, I must say that we changed our carpets two years ago to Frieze.  The suction was so good that it started picking up the carpet, literally off of the floor!  The suction was too strong.  So after calling Dyson, they advised that I take off one or 2 belts.  Well, I took off both belts, and now the vacuum still works fine, and the suction is not too strong that it is a real chore to vacuum.  It still has a good enough suction though, without the two belts.  I am so thankful for my Dyson, and for the scientist who developed it.
Wouldn't buy anything else.....  This little vacuum is awesome.  I have several dog's which means there is a lot of hair and sand, this vacuum handles it all.  Just wish the hinges were not made of plastic.  Replacing my old mighty mite because both hinges broke off.  I change the bag weekly with all the hair and sand it picks up.
Great product. Highly recommend
Great Product  I have two dogs (potty training) tile and hardwood floors throughout my home I needed something to clean better than a swiffer or mop that spreads around germs.  Ive tried several different products on my hardwood floors always seem to leave streaks.  After using this product with the formula as directed floors of never been so clean no streaks on the hardwood for the first time. the only drawback as for tile it does not get hot water which is not good for the hardwood .
Awesome!  This vacuum is awesome, I previously misunderstood the attachments. Doh! The ease of use under and around furniture is like no other.  I recommend this to anyone who needs a vacuum.
Recommend this vacuum.  I hadn't purchased a vacuum cleaner in 16 years.  I read many reviews and of course always look at the number of stars by a product.  I love this vacuum cleaner.  My carpet is about 10 years old and in fairly good shape and after vacuuming one time I emptied the canister three times and this was just a living area and 2 bedrooms.  After vacuuming my carpet looked like I had just had it cleaned because of the way the carpet was lifted and looks so fresh.  I could see exactly where I had vacuumed and the carpet looked brand-new.  I even brought the vacuum cleaner out the next day and vacuumed again I would recommend this vacuum cleaner.  It is a little bit heavy but because it works as great as it does that's fine.
Just right  I was looking for an inexpensive and effective vacuum. I trusted the reviews and am happy with my decision. Fits in my cabinet which is an extra plus!
It's light and that is what I like.  Very powerful for its size. It's light and that is what I like.
She has new floors that look like wood but are tile  Bought it for my daughter. She has new floors that look like wood but are tile. They have 2 big Labs and lots of dirt that the dogs bring from outside.  She loves it, she couldn't believe the dirt that she got up when she thought her floors were clean using another appliance.
works great. perfect for my 2 bedroom apartment  works great. perfect for my 2 bedroom apartment. I have to empty it pretty much after each use, but it only takes 5 min.
My last Bissell Zing lasted me 5 years, so I bought another one.
Very happy with this purchase.  Great vacuum, serves as a fantasic back up.
Great  This is by far the best vacuum cleaner I have ever owned from Bissell to Hoover.  I has amazing suction power and definitely worth the money.
Just died after 5 years of use  This is an excellent product for the price. It just died, after 5 years of use; we got it for around $40 then.  Used it to vacuum our 1,400 sq ft apartment, then our 1,700 sq ft condo about once a week. Besides the occasional belt and vacuum bag, it never complained.  For a budget vacuum, it's great. Could not ask for more.
Love shark.  Love my shark. Easy to assemble, works great.
Great product, fast shipping
Great Vacuum Cleaner  This is my first bagless vacuum cleaner, and I think it's great. It's built well, has many accessories and is easy to maneuver.
Great suction for a small inexpensive vacuum
It is easy to use  This vacuum does what it is expected to do. It came with lots of attachments,It is easy to use, We like this vacuum but today, we gave it to our daughter. It is not the model my wife wanted. She wanted the powered model. I went to the Shark web site and ordered the one she wanted and got it yesterday. We still have our first Shark. I use it in the basement. It still works excellent.
Best Vacuum I've ever used.  Best vacuum I've ever used. I absolutely love it. The vac picks up dog hair and fine dirt too.
love this item... thank you...
Best floor machine I have ever purchased! My house has never been cleaner!
Just look and you'll see the results  This is an amazing machine. We had always had canister vacuum cleaner and when ours broke, we borrowed our neighbors Dyson. We were amazed and bought one. We have dogs and thought we were vacuuming their hair up until we saw what ended up in the see thru center of the Dyson. If we'd been getting up this much hair with our canister vac, we'd have been constantly changing vacuum bags, but we weren't. I'm convinced that this vacuum does a much better job.
Bissell bagless vacuum  Bissell rewind bagless vacuum is wonderful.
MultiArcade Platinum Edition  We had an issue with the shipping company, but Matt was very helpful in getting that resolved. Communication was great and the product is awesome. My kids are still talking about all the games. Almost every day they're finding a new fun game to play.
Longer lasting  Began ordering these for the office due to another brand that broke every 1-2 months due to the high use. I am nearing 3 months of having these and have had no issues yet.
Great vacuum and company!  This vacuum is awesome. I'm not extremely fond of the color, but the functionality is what counts. The main brush is so powerful that it pulls the vacuum across the carpet and the quick disconnects for the hand tools make it amazingly user friendly. Also, Shark customer service is great! About two months after receiving my product from Amazon, I realized that I had received a different tool than the advertised Premium Pet Power Tool. I utilized Shark's online chat customer service and was immediately offered a replacement free of charge. Great product and company!
Hoover Wind Tunnel Anniversary Upright Vacuum self propelled  We used this once, just received it recently and of course will be using it a lot. We purchased a thicker carpet for a couple of rooms and this makes vacuuming much easier since it is self propelled. I would recommend it to others looking for this type of cleaner.
An amazing and inexpensive floor sweeper.  I certainly recommend it to a friend.
~  Excellent - light weight, strong suction, easy to clean - no messy bags and filters...works great for this cat sanctuary of 50 cats!
My floors look better then ever!
Works well  So far it works great for a great price so I'm super happy with it!
Good Powerful vacum
Great Product!  This remanufactured Dyson is great!  Shipping was very fast and it arrived in good condition -- very easy to assemble (basically just attach the handle). The very first time I used it, I couldn't believe all the cat hair it picked up -- I thought my house was clean!  I had been looking at Dyson vacs for a long time, but wasn't sure I wanted to spend the money.  I'm very happy with the remanufactured product -- great product for a great price!
Scrubs floor and removed dirty water. Awesome  Wish I would have bought this a long time ago.  I will never use a regular mop again.  Scrubs floor and removed dirty water.  Awesome product
Hello Dyson!!  Sooo, my Hoover died yesterday and I unexpectedly found myself in the market for a new vacuum, again. I had been researching online and decided on a Bissell lift-off since my biggest struggle has always been the stairs. I got to the store and found they were out. The fellow asked me why I was so interested in that particular model anyway so I responded with the stair requirement as well as my allergies to both types of dustmites. He proceeded to tell me about the Dyson. I was concerned about the expense since it was twice as much as the Bissell I was looking at, then I found out the price of the replacement filters, $30 a pop. I couldn't tell from the forums where I had researched the vacuum since it's rarely in Canadian dollars and here I was in a store that sold them. At that price it certainly wouldn't take long until the two cost me the same anyway. So I brought home the Dyson.  There have been some complaints with the Dyson and I think it's all about perspective. For instance I'm 5'5" and to some that's tall for a girl, in my family, I'm a midget. I have no trouble handling the Dyson and not only am I short, I'm a notorious wimp. The Dyson is actually lighter than my Hoover and the Hoover had just as much trouble getting under things. The light on the Hoover didn't do anything for me either. I'd recommend that if getting under things is important, get one of those little swiffer carpet cleaner things since you're not that likely to find a lot of ground in dirt or stir up dust in those locations anyway and use the hand tool every so often to get it done well. (or if you're small like me just crawl under and breathe deeply, jk)  My favorite things:  - the wandy thing; not only is it cool, it does an excellent job on the stairs, no more lifting the vacuum with me because of the long hose which I found easy to use. On the bottom stairs though it wanted to follow me so it was a bit wierd at first but once you're higher up and the vacuum is against the bottom, I had no trouble with the hose and stretching it to where I needed it. I also had no trouble with it on the second and third set of stairs either. It was so easy I was doing all the baseboards too just for fun. It's also cool that the roller turns off when you're using it, we did a nice job of destroying the lino with the old one when we were doing the stairs.  - suction! non stop! it picked up a ton of the fine dust my other vacuum missed the day before as well as some dog hair. We bought the house from the dog owners a year ago and the steam clean and regular vacuming had failed to get these renegade leftovers. The fine dust from the different rooms (since of course you don't have to dump as often as my old one) kinda reminded me of those jars with layered colored sand, there was SO much!  - cleaning; with my allergies to dust the old vacuum may have had allergen filtration, but that doesn't protect me when I'm wacking the filter against the side of the house and getting the canister out to dump it, both of which had to be done everytime I vacuumed. The spring loaded canister dumping mechanism is brilliant! No more stuffiness/tiredness after cleaning day from the allergies. The hepa filter looks easy to clean too so I almost can't wait the several months it will take until it's time to clean it.  - detachable parts for clog killing; my old vacuum would get clogged ALL the time, we'd have to take parts of it apart with 2 different screwdrivers and then stab it with a coat hanger in all kinds of wierd angles to declog it. Vacuums will get clogged, especially if you live with furry friends so it's nice to know that when it happens, it's super easy to get where you need to be to clear the obstructions. I didn't even have to read the manual to find this handy parts.  - the little edge brushes; obviously this is not as good as going around with the wand for when you want to do a deeper clean but it certainly does a good enough job so that you have the luxury of not having to use attachments EVERY time like most vacuums I've used. It also doesn't seem to attack my bed skirt as violently as others have.  - auto shutoff when the motor gets hot; this is especially good considering that's what killed my Hoover yesterday  Bye bye Hoover, Hello Dyson!!
Best value out there  Best vaccuum out there! So worth the money and amazing performance. I could not believe what this vaccuum pulled out of my carpet.
Great Vacuum  This vacuum is worth the purchase after 3 years its still going strong. Its a little on the heavy side and you will get a workout, but it works beautifully.
great suction, perfect attachments  lightweight, great suction, perfect attachments. my pets aren't huge shedders, but i like to use the little paw attachment for the stairs. it has its own rollers so it's fantastic.
The best vacuum cleaner I've ever used!  This is the first vacuum I've owned that leaves no trace of scent behind in the air after vacuuming. The HEPA filtration system is fantastic. The HEPA filter (Model 3282) works great and I didn't even have to replace it for over a year which is much longer than the 6 months they recommend. I own the Bissell Healthy Home 6100 Vacuum and I can say it is the best vacuum cleaner I've ever purchase. I used to own Hoover products but they really went down hill as far as the quality of manufacturing goes along with many other problems. This thing works equal to the top Dyson or Kirby but at a fraction of the cost!
Great Vacuum!  Just received and used this vacuum a few times today and I love it! When I was a kid my mom had a Dyson, so I know what a good vacuum is. I, too, almost bought a Dyson because I remember how wonderful it was to use it. I am so glad I went with this! It cleans just as well in my opinion! We have a long-haired dog and a short haired cat.  Putting it together was a very easy; besides putting a screw into the handle everything else just snaps in. Some people were saying this vacuum sounded like a lawnmower.... REALLY??? No way, it's quiet to me. It's also light and easy to push around, even on the lowest carpet setting. The cord is a great length, plenty long for me to do several areas without switching outlets. Granted, my apartment is only 1,000 square feet, but the living/ dining room area is very large. The tools are wonderful! I used the regular wand to get the corners of my kitchen floor, the crevice tool for the pet hair around the baseboards, the rubber brush tool to get the dust that collects on my walls from the A/C vents, and the rolling tool on the furniture. All worked very well! I was amazed by the suction through the hose (my last vacuum had almost no suction with it's hose).  The only thing I would change is to have the hose be a little longer. It's manageable but kind of tight and springy so you kinda have to keep track of the vacuum while using the hose. Emptying the dust bin is an improvement from my last vacuum, but could be a little smoother. Most of the dirt fell out when I got the bottom open, but it was kinda packed in there so I did have to reach in and get the rest. Not that bad really....on my last vacuum the dang container emptied from the top- it was just open when you dislodged it from the unit. Groooossss. But not this one!  I am very, very pleased with this purchase, especially since I didn't have to spend very much! $120 is a steal for this unit. I almost bought the rewind version (UH70831) but I don't mind winding my own cord...Been doing it forever so why not save $20? Definitely buy with confidence, your money won't be wasted!
This vacuum is amazing!  I have four pets and it does wonders on both carpet and hardwood.  The handheld piece with roller has it's own motor and so has very strong suction.  I haven't seen my sofa so free of dog hair!!  It's maneuvers easily and has a handle extension so both myself and my tall husband can use it easily.  It also was able to extend to such an extent that I was able to reach all the way underneath the beds.  The only difficulty that I noticed is upon emptying the canister.  It can be a little clunky and requires more exposure to waste than I'd prefer, but a small price to pay for a great vacuum!
Great Value For The Powerful Cleaning!  Great value for the power, long hose, extra-long cord, HEPA filter, and tools.  The vacuum is effective at all heights. I like that I can get my VROOM-on in various rooms of my home whether it's tile, linoleum or carpeting and clean everything very well. I really like the wide path covered and the tools especially the Turbo Brush for upholstery. The canister is easy to remove, seems to collect debris without an unsettled mess. The freedom of NOT forever purchasing vacuum cleaner bags is a JOY!  It's easy-to-assemble with a Phillips screwdriver.  Some items are a little stiff with newness like the wheels, the hose which do "smooth out" with use. The unit itself is heavier than other vacuums AND more powerful. A nice-to-have is a retractable cord mechanism but obviously NOT essential.  All my comments are based on living in a single-story home with a dark-haired mixed-breed Cocker Spanielish mutt that sheds.  I like nice and neat without spending forever accomplishing it as I'm no Domestic-Diva. This affords me that opportunity without breaking the bank and is a practical gift for home warming & wedding showers.
Love it!
Great for domestic or professional use!  Love, love, love. I clean houses professionally and use this vacuum cleaner all the time. Easy to use, great attachments, and works great on pet hair. Many of my clients have months of pet hair piled up and this vacuum takes care of it with no trouble. It's easy to disassemble for cleaning, which I do after every cleaning. Easy access to the filter too, a quick rinse of all parts and let dry...then you're done!  It is heavier than some vacuums but not as heavy as others. I think the weight helps with getting pet hair and dirt out of carpets and it's not so heavy that I can't use it on a regular basis with no trouble. It comes with pet stain cleaner that you let dry before vacuuming and it comes right now. I'm very satisfied with the vacuum and if I ever need to replace it, I'll definitely get another of this model!
these are great vacuums! we love ours, best vacuum we have ever had, definitely worth the money.
Love it  I've had at least six different vacuums over the last 30 years, mostly good, but this is my favorite. Not too noisy, easy to dump contents with no bag to buy. Cord long enough to vacuum the living area without unplugging.  Nice long wand that extends to get the ceilings, shortens to get under the furniture, canister compact and easy to pull behind. Does a great job on hardwood and upholstery.  Only have small "carpet" mats in the mud room that it doesn't work well on, but they're quite shaggy and maybe I'm not using it right. The release that disengages the beater bar is nice if you vacuum up a sock. I also have a Miel but would sweep the big stuff into he trash and then vacuum because the bags are so friggin expensive. It now stays upstairs in the guest rooms and rarely gets used. Meanwhile the dyson gets leaves from potted plants, dirt clods, ( live in muddy Oregon on a farm) bits of wood around the fireplace, and whatever the cat and dog drag in.
Very handy, dandy vacuum  I bought this to replace another brand that had a broken wheel and used bags.  I love this little fella, easy to pull, sturdy tube,  all attachments I need plus a cord retractor.  What's not to love?  For those who said it sucked up throw rugs...I have a furniture accessory with a brush from another vac that just fits this hose and it did a great job on throw rugs at full power without sucking them up.  The cord was long enough to reach from one end to the other of my kitchen/dining area with no problem.  You can always use an industrial extension cord if reach is a problem.  I have a long haired dog and this does a great job with the hair but you may need a small brush of some type to get all the hair out of the dust cup. Highly recommend this.
Amazingggggg  My wife loves it. Replaced the yellow ball dyson with this one. Couldnt believe how much dirt this picked up after vacuuming with 5 yr old dyson.
I couldn't be happier with this  I couldn't be happier with this! I have always had a canister vacuum but this works so much better. I especially love the longer cord and the attachments.
Best cordless vacuum I've ever used
Shark Uoright  This works so much  better than my Oreck! I had to empty the container after one sweep thru the house.  It is easy to push, easy to empty and easy to use the attachments!
Fantastic Lightweight Vacuum Stands Up To Heavy Use!  We have a commercial property and use these vacuums in our housekeeping department.  LOVE them!  They stand up to LOTS of use, and really do vacuum very well.  It does well on long, short and no carpet.  It is very easy to clean and maintain the vacuum.  I highly recommend the Shark Navigator NV105 vacuum for home or business use.  I love the weight as well, very easy when you have hours of vacuuming to do!  Shark came out with other models after the NV105...don't bother with them!  The NV105 is the best and lightest weight.  I have tried two of the newer models and was very disappointed.  I thought they would be upgrades but they were heavy and hard to maneuver.
Best vacuum ever
Good Value  A very good value for the price.  Performs well on all surfaces.
Great Little Sweeper  I purchased this sweeper for a small apartment.  I was surprised by how well it performs.  I have a Dyson at my home and thought I'd be disappointed.  It's perfect for my needs....small, lightweight, bagless & efficient!  I do not know if I would recommend it for large homes or for excessive pet hair but who knows?
Great!!
I love this vacuum  I love this vacuum!  Yes you have to dump the dirt often but it's lightweight, really sucks up the dirt - I have tile and large throw rugs and works well on both.  Really impressed- got my mom one too
Great Vac  Great wood floor vac.  Can't beat the price!
Outstanding!!  WOW! I absolutely love this little machine! I was amazed at how powerful the suction is; it literally does a better job than even the best uprights I've had. I bought this vacuum to clean my three flights of carpeted stairs and for the areas that large upright vacs can't reach, and it does a wonderful job! I wish I'd bought an Oreck years ago.
Deep Cleaning & versatile  While we try to take utmost care of our carpets, it is just impossible to keep is spotless clean with a 3-yr old running around.  For immediate carpet cleaning, our ready answer is always a handheld wet-dry portable vacuum which takes care of it immediately.  But to really achieve spotless cleaning an hygiene - we needed something more powerful and detailed thats when we got the Bissell 73H5.  The cleaner is very easy to use and self heating  - watch out : some of the carpet cleaners, yes even the ones costing $100+ require you to put hot water in the cleaner.  I never used the lift off unit so I cannot comment it - but I did try to lift it - it is easy to lift off with the push of a button.  What is good:   * Very effective cleaner   * Built in Water heater   * Portable cleaner   * Hose Pipe to reach out to reach out to spots, edges, stairs and upholstry  What is not good:   * Water tank requires multiple refills  a 15x20 room requires as much as 5 tank refills   * A bit heavy to move back and forth  Comparison between bissell 94Y2 and 73H5 :  The 73H5 comes with a Pet Strain eraser tool, if you do not need this you can the 94Y2 is exactly the same cleaner minus the tool.  Here is an amazon link to 94Y2: <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bissell-Lift-Off-Deep-Cleaner-94Y2/dp/B005FM2B5K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bissell Lift-Off Deep Cleaner, 94Y2</a>  ~ Update May 14 2012 I find that I am using the portable spot cleaner more than the full unit.  I have detached the portable unit and kept it in close proximity to living room, always ready with water and cleaning fluid - the moment there is a spill/cleanup of any liquid - I just use it to clean up the mess.
Stars are in limbo!  Anxiously waiting for my new vacuum cleaner  My old, old, old Hoover Windtunnel finally gave up the ghost and died. I loved it so much that I have bought a new one!  The box just arrived in terrible shape, one of the cleaning wands is missing, and the pet tool that is supposed to be packaged in a plastic bag is not packaged at all. I have contacted Amazon and I have been assured that I will be receiving another one tomorrow, along with a return shipping label for the other one. I have every confidence that Amazon will stand behind its product and that I will be delighted with my new cleaner.
Love it!  Couldn't live without this machine! Love it!
Dogs and Kids versus Vacuum...Vacuum WINS!  OK, so I've been using this vacuum for 5 months now. We have a 75 lb black lab and a long coated GSD. They both shed, a lot. The lab hair is particularly nasty - it is difficult to remove.  We also have 4 small children, we homeschool too, and our kids and dogs are in, and out, and in and out all the long day..we create a ton of dirty....Here's my take:  I vacuumed the whole house with the old vacuum.  Then I went over everything with the new Hoover WindTunnel Pet...I filled the canister in each and every carpeted room of our house. Yes, EVERY SINGLE ROOM.  This vacuum made me freak-out. The amount of dirt and dust that had been accumulating in my rugs was disgusting.  Honestly, we vacuum every second day and and we still fill the canister every two rooms. The sucking power has not diminished at all.  Four months later:  I still can fill the canister every second room. Sucking power is still awesome.  If you are looking of a quiet, lightweight vacuum to tidy up your home, look elsewhere. My kids insist on wear hearing protection when they use it. No joke, this thing could damage your hearing. and if you take it up and down the stairs a few times you can skip a visit to the gym. But, if you are looking for a vacuum that can handle major dirt and not loose suction, this is your vacuum!  I LOVE this thing.
Works wonderfully, picks up way more than my old vacuum  Changed my life. Works wonderfully,picks up way more than my old vacuum. and less loud than old vacuum, so doesn't turn my poor 125lb great dane/pit mix into a barking, crying, hiding baby. That last fact would make it five stars, but the fact that it picks up EVERYTHING is awesome.
I love this vacuum  I just recently purchased this vacuum and its awesome. I have not taken this vacuum on a job but i put it to the test first to test it out, and it picked up everything with the first pass and the suction is out of this world. Definitely recommend this product to everyone. the backpack itself was super light too.
Great vacuum cleaner  Great vacuum cleaner! Very powerful and very versatile! Would by it. Do have several other vacuum cleaners, including very expensive ones. Save your money, this is the machine to go! Love it. Especially with the hardwood brush, it is a very powerful and easy tool for little money. Makes my life easy and my wife happy!
Oreck Commercial Compact Canister  We purchased an Oreck Compact Canister about 15 years ago and I use it all the time.  It has amazing suction and is lightweight.  I was very concerned when it finally wore out that I would not be able to find one but again Amazon came through and had the new model available.  Highly recommend.
I can say that I am very pleased with it now  I have been through many vacuums in my life span.  Dogs, children, messy foot husband.  They have ranged from cheap to expensive.  Although I can not yet testify to how long it last, I can say that I am very pleased with it now.  The suction is super.  It is lightweight and easy to move around.  The hose turns easily.  The cord is push button rewind.  With the added brush, I am very satisfied at this point.  Germans know how to make machines.
Very Pleased!  Did not purchase from Amazon but just want to say that I'm glad I chose this bagged vacuum over a bagless one. This is more powerful, less expensive and does not affect my allergies. I was actually smiling while I was vacuuming. The extension is powetful too. I vacuumed my couch cushions with ease. The only negativity is that my little dog is intimated by it and barks his head off but I'm sarcastically speaking and am happy with my new vacuum!
Have had this for a couple of months and really like it so far.  I've used this product for a few months in my house for cleaning surfaces and hardwood floors.  Positives: - Good suction - Very light--small footprint - Retractible cord which has so far worked well - No bags to replace - Just enough attachments (two besides the wide smooth floor attachment) - HEPA filter  Negatives: - Emptying the container is a bit messy--you have to reach in and wipe it (and the filter) off if you want to clean out all the dust etc.  Hose to main body fitting is a push-friction connection--no "click into place."  But works fine, just feels uncertain ("Is this all the way in?"). I haven't had any problem with the length of the cord, probably because it is about the length of my last vacuum cord and so it's no shorter than what is usual for me. I don't try to use this on rugs--not sure how it would do, but it is not a carpet cleaner vacuum. In general, a great little product.
Easy to assemble  Just took it out of the box today. Easy to assemble, and great suction. Very happy with my purchase.
Great vac  Tops for the money-great suction especially for the size-very easy to transport -- was purchased used and was a great buy as well as virtually new cond
Great vacuum set!  I LOVE my Hoover Platinum set... Bags are expensive, but the bags are pretty big and last me quite some time, and I'm in a large townhouse with two big medium-haired cats that shed constantly. The vacuum is light and easy to lift to do stairways; the little vac is great for corners, edges, curtains, and, most importantly for me, the sofas! Suction is great, the light is a nice feature, and it's not terribly loud (although before this I had a dirt devil that sounded like it was jet engine propelled, so that could be biased). The only thing slightly negative I can say is that ccasionally it develops a slightly strange smell, but once I use a little carpet freshener that seems to go away.
We got this on an Amazon LIghtning deal and SOOOOO happy we did  A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!!!! We got this on an Amazon LIghtning deal and SOOOOO happy we did. I love the Hoover carpet cleaner I've owned for years and now love this hard floor cleaner even more!!
AWESOME!
Sucks.  :-)  Love this vacuum.  I had a Mighty Might that I bought back in the early 1990's and it lasted so very long.  Finally, 20 years later I replaced the original with this vac.  Works just as well as the old one.  Sucks mightily.  Which is what we all want.  ;-)  I love that it still has hepa bags.  I hate trying to empty the little plastic dirt containers on the bagless vacs.  I sneeze for hours afterwords.  With these bags, I just grab it, stick it in the trash, and I am done without any clouding of the air with old dust and allergens above my trash can.
Love this machine  We have a dog who has had plenty of accidents in two areas of our livingroom.  The carpet was smelly and dirty.  After we cleaned the carpet we thought after a week the dirty would come through but it has not.  My carpets look wonderful.  I would recommend this carpet cleaner to everyone.
GOOD PRODUCT
Perfect for small jobs or big!  Bought it for an apartment.  But works great for the 4 bedroom house that I moved into.  Highly recommended.  Picks up pet hair great too.
Never would've thought...  If you would have asked me a month ago if I would spend over $100.00 for a vacuum, I would have told you, you were crazy! I like to think I'm not cheap, but frugal. (My wife thinks otherwise) When our Bissel quit working I started looking to get another inexpensive vacuum. Based on talking to many friends and their extreme excitement over their Dyson, I did a lot of research. Seems no one regretted their purchase. So, I forked over the money and ordered the Dyson. My wife was so excited she took the day off from work so she could VACUUM! Turns out the Dyson was everything everyone said it was and more! Cleans like a world champion. We even think it has helped with our son's allergies as he has not been sneezing or as congested since we started using it. That was worth the price just for that. Also, after checking around, Amazon had the best price by $100.00 to $150.00 over any retail stores. That made me happy. Take it from a frugal (cheap-o) shopper, spend the money...it's worth it!
good design - a high quality vacuum  I bought this Electrolux Precision vacuum (Model 8802 Type A) at Costco on July 7, 2013 for $158.99.  It was on sale from the regular Costco price of $199.99 from July 1-28.  I'm writing after the first use.  So far, I like the vacuum.  I used it on Indian and Persian wool area rugs and wood floors and it works great. It's very easy to switch the height with the toe switch--a blue LED light inidcates the level setting.  A big surprise was that the the rotating brush head didn't snag the fringe on these rugs, which is a nice difference from the old vac.  Very good cleaning, adust container is big enough to do several rooms before emptying. I also used the wand feature with the "multi-tool" which I did not find that effective. I prefer the regular dust brush attachment on the wand and used it to clean spider webs and to dust window sills etc.  That works very well.  One design highlight is that the vacuum body does not tip over even when the wand hose is stretched to its maximum of about 12 feet.  That's because the hose is connected to the vacuum near its base, and the low center of gravity prevents tipping.
Shark does well all the cleaning tasks I have tried.  This has replaced a hoover wind-tunnel vacuum that just wasn't picking up any longer.  The Shark has worked effectively, as advertised cleaning both carpets and bare floors.  It is not a lightweight unit, but quite manageable.  If it continues to work as well as it does now (no reason why it won't), I would replace it with another in a heartbeat.
Good vacuum especially for the price point!  Great vacuum for the price!  This has the suction and performance of a much more expensive vacuum.  I purchased this for our office for during the Wisconsin winters when allot of salt and chemicals get tracked into our entryway.  This ran laps around our old vacuum, however the old vacuum had seen better days.  It doesn't seem to hold allot of particles in the cleaning zone, and you don't have to worry about it dropping things while transporting.  I haven't used the hand attachment yet but it seems very sturdy and well built.  Overall I would recommend this product!
It's a great little machine--have to get used to it 'helping me' pick the path for vacuuming tho....:)  I'm used to one I have to much with one hand and pull with the other (canister).  I think it will work out fine;  did wish the canister the holds the vacuumed  dog hair was a little larger--but it MT"s easily. Thanks for a smaller and 'more convenient to store' type vacuum.
Yay! No Bags!!  Works great! The best part is...no longer have to purchase bags! I use it every day to clean pet bird cages and have never had any  problems with suction .. i empty the container daily and once a week wash the filter.. i have two filters, so when one is drying i use the other. I have a different Electrolux that uses bags, i only use that vacuum cleaner on occasion & the good part is that ALL the attachments fit both vacuum cleaners, even the hose is interchangeable excellent buy, highly recommend!
I love this vacuum!!  I love this vacuum so far. It is the first vacuum I've had that picks up hair so well. I love that it is bagless and I can wash the filters. I love all the different attachments and the fact that I can carry it or put it on the roll away cart. If you use the hose a lot I highly suggest putting it on the roll cart rather than the vacuum head. It tips over way too easy on the vacuum head. It's kind of annoying to have to switch, but I also love the swivel action while vacuuming so I don't mind trading out bottoms. It also worked really well to clean my car.
Impressive!  I'm delighted with this vacuum cleaner.  I recently got a cat and wanted to keep the pet hair under control.  I thought I would have to spend at least twice as much money (probably more!) to get this much suction.  It pushes just fine across the carpet (even on low setting) and seems to do a good job.  The real benefits are the attachments.  The hose has fantastic suction and they weren't kidding when they called it a turbo brush.  I wouldn't use it on anything delicate, but it's great for regular upholstery.  I used the dusting attachment on my lampshades and was impressed.  I also wanted a bagged vacuum (less mess... which is the point of cleaning!), which seem to be harder to find these days.  The downsides are that it's sorta hard to get the hose out of it's holder and it's a little heavy.  But overall, I would definitely recommend this vacuum, especially if you're looking for good attachment suction.  And only $80!!
LOVE IT  Very portable - light weight and efficient. highly recommend it! Love the attachments - easy to connect, easy to store.
Factory-Reconditioned Dyson DC14 Animal Upright Vacuum  I received the product in a timely manner, and the assembly was quite easy. I used the vacuum and was quite pleased with everything. It picked up an amazing amount of dirt and pet hair, even though I had used my old vacuum shortly before. It was very easy to empty contents of the dirt chamber and reinstall it on to the unit. I have to say I was very pleased with the unit. As for the Factory-Reconditioned piece of it,  the unit appears brand new and no evidence of scratches or use. This was considered a high dollar purchase in my mind, but I wanted to get away from the dust my old unit seemed to release into the air, the Dyson seems to keep it inside the vacuum. Again, I'm very pleased and can only hope it will last and work as well as it has on the first few trips around the house.
My new friend  I'm absolutely in love with this machine. I vacuum, wash and dry my tiled floors with ease. I can clean my entire house in one morning. The tanks separate dirty from clean water, and you can use your own cleaning solution. Pay attention to the recommendations for cleaning product though some things will not work.
Bissell PowerGroom really picks up dog hair  My previous vacuum is a Hoover vacuum specifically for picking up pet hair.  This Bissell vacuum works wonderfully to pick up hair and dirt out of the carpet.  This vacuum actually does a better job of vacuuming out all the dog hair from the carpet.  I have a Scottie who has an undercoat that gets deep into the carpet and this vacuum gets it out.  This vacuum is easier to get the hose and attachments off also.  Two drawbacks are that this vacuum is heavier than the Hoover but this is not a major issue.  One feature I miss from the Hoover is the auto cord retraction BUT this Bissell has a longer cord than the Hoover does.  All in all this is a great vacuum, especially if you have furry pets running around!
Was afraid of "bagless"...  This is hands-down the best vacuum cleaner we've ever had. I was afraid to get the bagless model after hearing things about bagless vacuums in general, but WOW glad that I did.  We have 3 dogs (2 of whom shed quite a bit, the other is an average shedder). Dog hair was everywhere in our house on a daily basis, no matter how much cleaning we did.  I am amazed at how well this vacuum picked it all up! Our carpets look brand new, our furniture (thanks to the attachment) is dog hair free after vacuuming.  The attachments are really helpful and the vacuum is sturdy enough that it doesn't tip even if you pull the hose out pretty far!  As far as cons go, it is heavy and it is loud. Worth it to me to have the cleaning power, though!
In this case you are actually paying for what you really want!  A novel idea and a GREAT vacuum.  In all the years that I've owned vacuum cleaners I never gave much thought about the actual mechanics.  I had always lived in apartments so never saw it worth investing in something like this.  I've been living in a house for the last 3 years and bought this here last year.  Now that I've owned it for a year I can tell you how impressive this vacuum is.  It has brought up so much dust, dander, and whatever the old vacuum missed.  I was AMAZED at how much cr@p came out of the carpeting from each room!  It soon became very obvious that the canister filled with things the previous vacuum missed.  I was emptying the canister quite often the first few times we used the animal.  I can't begin to tell you how glad I spent the money on this vacuum because it is simply amazing and blows me away ever time I see how much dust comes out of the carpet.  It works best in carpeted environments as that is what this machine's specialty is.  If you are a homeowner with carpeting this is one of the best bets around.  You simply cannot go wrong with this extremely powerful vacuum.  If you live in a condo or have wooden floors it may not be worth your while spending the money on this vacuum.  It shines when it does large volumes of carpeting.  If you don't have a lot of carpet that's another reason to look for something cheaper unless you don't care how much you are spending.  I have not experienced any problems with clogging or diminished airflow because every second use I clean all vent holes of dust making sure to pull the dust out and not push it in.  Suction remains as strong as when it was first used.
The Sebo X4 is best all around vacuum  I can't think of another Vacuum Cleaner that I would ever want to own. The Sebo X4 is best all around vacuum. It adjusts to my floor surfaces and my thick carpets. The roller brush removes easily for pet hair that can rap itself around any roller brush.
Great value!  The first time I used this vacuum it picked up so much dirt I had to empty the cup after cleaning each room of our small apartment.  I find that the vacuum is also much quieter than our old one and it is also quite easy to clean.
Great vacuum  I should have bought this vacuum years ago.  I have two inside dogs and have to vacuum daily.  It's a breeze with this Dyson.  It picks up like nothing I've had before, is very quiet and effortless to push around.
Very pleased.  This vacuum picks up pet hair, and everything else, better than my Dyson. Excelllent vacuum, I would recommend it to everyone.
Great suction for a light weight Vaccum!!  I purchased this vacuum for my cabin, as I wanted something light weight. When I received the vacuum, I charged the battery and then used it in my home first.  I vacuumed 3 rooms really good and never ran out of power. I was amazed at how much dust and carpet fibers were in the canister.  I love how you can get underneath end tables & go around corners so easily.  Before I take it to my cabin, I'm going to use it in my home one more time. If it works like it did the first time, I just may be buying an extra one for my home here.  It has better suction then my expensive vacuum and it is so much lighter weight.  So far, I love this Hoover Air vacuum!
You feel the quality as soon as you touch it  Incredible. we use this vacuum in a church building, so it is used heavily. We all love it. It's so versatile and easy to use. You can feel the quality right away. I started cleaning after it was already purchased so I didn't know what it cost. First time i used it I thought it must have cost $1000 or more. The wand is in a very convenient location and is easy to use.
A must have accessory for neato owners, neato does not provide enough magnetic strip with the vacuums  A must have for neato owners.  The reason I gave it five stars is because my wife and I think the neato is awesome.  We prefer the magnet strips vs the Roomba virtual wall posts.  The magnetic strips are so much cheaper than virtual walls, and can be cut to any length/room we need.  When guests come, the strips roll up cleanly to be put away.
other than the pictorial instructions only, no text help, the big ball unit was fantastic.  It is much  easier to push and pull around the house compared to a top of the line WindTunnel unit.  I called support 2 X on the day I received it for clearer assembly instructions.  They are professional, helpful, very happy to help.  AWESOME
A little vacuum with BIG results  Previously I had used a Hoover, but purchased this Eureka when the Hoover died after 1 1/2 year.  I have not used the Eureka for two weeks and am blown away with what a job it does.  Yes, it is a little harder to use on carpet, but that is because the suction is so great.  (Suction can be adjusted easily on the handle.)  The amount of dirt and pet hairs that are coming out of my carpet is just amazing;  obviously the old vacuum was not doing an adequate job.  It is very easy to clean out and care for in general.  Also works well on bare floors.  I highly recommend this little wonder.
Amazing  Amazing. Great sucking power, versatile, love the LEDs illuminating the dust laterally, creating long shadows so it becomes more obvious.
Best of the best! I recommend for hardwood floors, vinyl, ceramic. Not intended for carpet though.
Works great! Better than any other vacuum I've ever  Works great!  Better than any other vacuum I've ever had
Got it and does a good Job
Good product.  Light weight.  Easy to maneuver.  Does a good job even on my thick shag rug.  Just be careful not to run over the corner of thin area rugs.  The corner of the rug got pulled in and shredded.  Powerful machine.
Love this product  I do the vacuuming. It seems to pick up everything. Works better than the $500 Oreck we had. Cheap enough to replace rather than fix it it goes south.
Pips has a Dyson it's good. I used a friend's shark to vacuum the floor and it really moved the carpet, fluffed it up like new again.  Decided to get this one as it is a professional version, I have a dog and there's allot of dirt, sand and dead grass haha  The first use was awesome and every time since only draw back is when you pull backwards swiftly it shimmys you'll see what I'm talking about. Second, the hose insertion at the base needs to be cleaned out every few vacuums add it definitely gets clogged from hair, human and dog. Also make sure it's pushed on tight add it will pop off and you'll lose complete suction.
Arrived as expected
Hoover windtunnel  Excellent product.  This is the second Hoover self-propelled windtunnel I have owned and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a very good vacuum cleaner.
Works great now!  I had trouble pushing and steering this vacuum and wondered how it got so many good ratings. The suction was so strong it kept trying to suck up my area rug. Finally I went back and read the reviews on Amazon, thinking someone must have figured out what to do, and sure enough - all it took was a small paper clamp to hold the cover of the hose holder slightly ajar!
Fast shipping & item arrive safely.
The best vacume I've ever owned  The best vacume I've ever owned. The auction is incredible! I have four dogs and this may have saved my sanity. Highly recommend.
This is the best anti-pet hair vacuum I've used. Love it.
GREAT FOR THE PRICE  I have an alaskan malamute that sheds 24/7 and is an indoor dog this vacuum is 3 + years old and still going strong we use it every day ( I am not kidding ) No other vacuum has lasted over a year with the same use. I have used Hoover and Eureka and spent twice the price.
great vacuum! works great! love the self rolling cord!
Great for hardwoods  Great for hardwoods. Vacuums and cleans with water at the same time. You need this if you have pets that shed!
A Mote in Dog's Eye  Well, I just wanted to chime in on this vacuum. I don't like canister vacuums and wanted to replace my 10 year-old Panasonic upright, a CR top-rated vacuum when I bought it.  I had three goals:  1.  A "true" bagless vacuum:  be aware that some so-called `bagless' vacuums use a pleated filter that has to be replaced as often as a paper bag.  To me that defeats much of the purpose of a bagless vacuum. 2.  An upright.  To me, towing a little wagon around behind me when I vacuum is a nuisance.  My wife prefers a canister vacuum, on the other hand, because she doesn't like any substantial weight when she pushes the vacuum around.  This brings me to.... 3.  The vacuum must be light enough that my wife will use it also. 4.  Not produce 'vacuum cleaner stink' as most bagged units do.  I liked the idea of cyclonic filtration:  industry has been using that process for decades to spin-out things like wood and coal dust, grains, etc., so I was attracted to the Dyson idea.  I purchased my DC-18 at Linens 'N' Things with a nice 20% discount (if you register online with them you qualify for a first-time discount of 20%:  I don't know if they still do that.) We have a short nap carpet installed in the carpeted areas of the house. After vacuuming with the Panasonic I put the Dyson to work and it really didn't pick up a lot of missed dirt (the Panasonic worked well for coarse dirt,) but I did notice the canister had collected a lot of very fine gray dust, carpet fibers and dog hair (we have a small black dog.  When I emptied the canister I noted that the dust was the same talcum-fine dust that I would see on the HEPA pre-filter.  After a month of vacuuming with the Dyson it suddenly dawned on me: I don't see the cloud of dust motes I used to see in a beam of sunlight. This vacuum captures dust far too fine for any bagged vacuum I've ever had. There is also no exhaust stink whatsoever.  The Dyson has a large canister (about the size of a 1-pound coffee can) that contains the `lifetime HEPA' exhaust unit: how long that will actually last remains to be seen (we all know what `lifetime' means.) There is also a washable filter about one inch-thick on top of the collection canister.  I thought about buying a spare but it appears to be made of layers of some sort of tough synthetic fiber that I doubt will wear out anytime soon.  I've already washed it by squeezing it under cold tap water (per instructions.)  I believe this would be a good vacuum for people with allergies.  Also, the small head is a good thing for getting into places but does make you make more passes to cover a large area. I use the Dyson on the wood floors in the kitchen and dining room and the tile in the halls and bathrooms. The `Ball' steering system is more than a gimmick and allows you to angle the power head into corners and along baseboards. Being able to turn the power brushes off and on from the power switch near the handle is also a very useful feature.  I can run the vacuum across tile and wood and then turn the brushes back on for small carpets or mats in the bathroom and kitchen.  The attachment system works pretty well considering that the DC18 is first and foremost an upright vac.  The attachment hose is a little short and you can't pull it very far from the vacuum without tipping it over.  The extension rod helps for reaching across things or using it on the floor.  As others have noted, having to unwind the cord to use the attachments is a pain:  a cord reel on the back of the vacuum would be nice.  I now have the dusting and mattress tools which allow me to do everything I need to around the house with this vacuum.  All in all a great machine, compact and lightweight.  It is so light, in fact, that I use it directly on the stair carpeting as opposed to the attachment brush.  It is easy to carry up and down stairs by carrying it by the canister handle.  The highest compliment that I can give it is to state that I am male, married for 27 years, and I actually look forward to using this vacuum!  The house is noticeably cleaner afterwards.  By the way, the Better Half approves of the weight and handling of this vacuum.  Success!  Time will tell how durable this machine is.  I will come back and edit this post if I have any mechanical problems.  Update 01-12-2009.  Yesterday, I came home to find MY Dyson laying on the floor and my wife on the phone with Dyson support (they put their number on the vacuum!)  I interrupted and asked what was wrong and was told me the beater-bar had stopped working.  I asked if she might have sucked up a string or something and did she use the reset button?  No? Well, my wife said a polite goodbye to the nice Dyson lady and after using the reset button finished the vacuuming.  I did put on a show, though: when I first started up and began vacuuming I said to the Dyson, 'there there, daddy's home, everythings going to be alright. That nice lady didn't mean any harm...'  My wife looked at me curiously for a bit and then left the room saying, 'you two have fun.' Of note is that my wife was able to call the provided Dyson toll-free number on a Sunday afternoon and get a helpful person who was taking her through a troubleshooting checklist. I'm impressed now with the company as well as the vacuum.  Update 1/05/2013 Still running strong.  The rear leg with wheels that pops out to support the vacuum when you return it to upright position now requires some assistance from the foot.  Not a problem, though, and I haven't contacted Dyson about it, although I may at some point.  Also, the 'lifetime' HEPA filter is starting to put out a small amount of vacuum-cleaner stink, not suprising to me after all these years. The vacuum still does its job as well as they day I bought it.  The savings in vacuum cleaner bags at this point is huge.  Update 1/14/2016 Still going great!  Replaced the lifetime HEPA filter and undercarriage with parts bought from Amazon.  The undercarriage was a bit of brain surgery but found helpful instructions online.  A great vacuum and a great investment for the dollar!
This is a great vacuum!!!  PROS: powerful suction, quiet, refinement, ease of use, quality build CONS:  short cord VERDICT: A great little canister vacuum at a very good price!
Much Better than Expected!  The Crosswave cleans so much better than expected. Hubby was not impressed until he saw how clean the floors are and how fast they dried.  We have two medium size dogs, and I did not want to fill the tank with dog hair on my first run with the Crosswave, so I ran the vacuum first. Then I followed the directions to fill it and operate it. I began cleaning the dining room and then the kitchen floors. I used 1 full tank of water and the floor was dry almost instantly.  My floors are not totally level, and there are dips here and there. I did notice sometimes it did not want to really dry the little dips or the edges. I just went over those areas a second time changing the angle slightly and that did the trick every time.  I have about 2,000 sf of linoleum. It requires 3 hours of being bent over vacuuming and mopping. I haul 2 gallon buckets of water and wring the mop a million times. I am 62.  The crosswave eliminates all of that! It also saves me gallons of water. I realized I did those two rooms on 1 tank of clean water. I would have used 2 gallons of water to do the same area.  What sold us was AFTER the cleaning was done. Hubby told me to do the white towel test. Put a little glass cleaner on a towel and rub the floor. No dirt at all! He did the towel test after I fell for the first microfiber floor mop. He told me it is pushing dirt around. Sure enough we did the white towel test and the floor was filthy.  My floors are squeaky clean! No back breaking buckets of water, hours bent over mopping and wringing either. I love this thing, and it surpassed what I thought it could do. I purchased the Crosswave from Bissell before it was for sale here on Amazon.
Best thing since sliced bread!  This vaccum is treamendous. Works wonderfully. Does a great job on hardwood and is light, manueverable and easy to manage. Oh, yes, it also really "sucks"! ... in a great way.
Lucky's review-good machine and dealer  Machine was a lot better than exspected to be. Works like magic on a hairy floor. It will be a work saver. Bissell doesn't list it as a model 3920. Don't know why they did that. Had to put the type in the search line (Pet hair eraser) for it to come up. Good machine and Dealer does good service.
One awesome vacuum!  I have a Dyson cordless and a DC40. This one is more quiet than either of them. The suction is phenominal. It actually sucks the beater-bar down to the floor. I am pleased to say it lives up to the hype. Of course with the larger size it is not as maneuverable as the DC40, but it makes up for that in power. It feels like it is self propelled making it an easy task to clean all my floors. Turn off the brush and this thing cleans wood/tile floors like a pro!
Great product!  Great packaging!  This is a great vacuum cleaner.  Sleek in design. Lightweight.  Powerful.  It even survived a torrential rainstorm. It was delivered to my porch while I was on vacation.  It was two days before a neighbor retrieved it. I had a professional check it out first.  Did not want to take any chances with an electrical product.  But, apparently, because of the efficient packaging, the vacuum cleaner was not ever directly exposed to the water.  So, it works just fine.  I have owned other vacuum cleaners.  But, especially for the price, this one is the best!
Works Fine  Works as advertised.
Great product  Works as described. Suction and maneuverability are great, and the light is a big plus for showing dust.
This vacuum sucks up dirt like nothing=very powerful,I really love this amazing,Eureka!!!
Great vacuum!  So glad I bought this vacuum.  It is so much quieter than my last Hoover.  And I like the fact that I see how much dirt it is picking up. The dirt cup is easy to empty and I will be nice not to have to buy bags.  I would highly recommend this vacuum.
I' ve only had it a little less than a week, but it works great.  Only think I would like to see with this unit is a rotating brush on the large head.  But it works great.  I will post updates as I go.
Dyson is the best! Don't forget to clean your filter!  I've had this vacuum for a couple of years and, today, I had an issue with it.  For someone considering the Dyson, please understand that most issues you have can easily be resolved by going online or calling the Dyson number.  Today, my machine just wasn't operating to its full capacity with suction so I pulled up the Dyson web site to find out what I needed to do. (I've had many, many vacuums over the years and never had solutions so readily available.) And, as has happened in the few times in the past when I've had a problem, the solution was there and easy to find in matter of minutes.  The Dyson is easy to take apart--I'm a single woman--and just as easy to put back together.  The money spent on this machine is well worth it.  I used to spend a lot of money on worthless vacuums that just didn't last so an initial bigger investment made sense to me.  As stated, I've used this vacuum for several years and I am still just as satisfied now as when I purchased it.  If you're worried it's too strong and will destroy your rugs, don't be.  I have antique oriental rugs and use the Dyson all the time without any signs of damage.  If you have cheaper carpets that might be prone to losing yarns, just turn the beater bar off.  Oh and the problem today?  Simply a matter of cleaning the filter--something I admittedly forget to do.  The filter is encased below the removable cannister.  You take it out, rinse well with running water and let air dry for 24 hours.  That's it!  Tomorrow, my Dyson will be back one hundred percent.  Good purchase!
Excellent vacuum cleaner. Went through several others before we came across Dyson. Dyson actually cleans the carpet. Strongly recommend!
awesome  I ordered this electrolux vacuum on Thursday and received it Saturday. Fast shipping from Amazon. Tried it out on my hardwood floor and tile floor and it picked the dirt and dog hair up with no problem.  I love the extended wand.  Easy to use and put together.  The only problem is you can not store all of the tools and the bag is a little small.
This was a good investment. The floors come out clean and the dryer works wonders on the floors. Would recommend for everyone who has hardwood floors and tile floors.
good suction for its price  Just received the item and vacuumed my hardwood floor. here are pros:   1:good suction   2:easy of use   3:its pretty quite compare to its power.   4:well packed(no scratch or damaged parts)   cons:   1:on/off switch could have used a bit more craftsmanship
Thank God for Customer Reviews!  To everyone who left a review-Thanks.  Dalmations are so white because all they do is shed.  With construction and red dirt thrown in, my carpets were a mess.  Had a Kenmore Progressive that died in 2 years.  I read the reviews how the Eureka took care of dog hair and pull the nap of the carpet until it looked like new.  Let me tell you-IT DOES.  I've had 6 vacuums.  Kenmore, Hoover whirlwind, Oreck xl, Roomba, Dirt Devil-guaranteed to break in one week and the Eureka cleans the best.  My carpet looks great.  The wide head vacuumed super fast.  A must have for people who have dogs and dirt.
Great buy for easy cleaning.  This was a great buy.  I disassembles easily.  Easy to clean.  It has great suction.  I like the retractable electric cord.
Light work vacumn  Nice inexpensive little vacumn. Does a fine job for light work
Long time Dyson owner, pretty impressed with the Hoover Wind Tunel  I have owned this product for a couple of weeks now and I must say I'm pretty impressed.  It's just as strong as the Dyson was in it's day, but just like any other vacuum the Dyson lost power after 9 years!!!  Now I don't expect the Hoover to last 9 years at a $125.00 price point, but if it lasts two or three it's well worth the money.  It's light, compact and removes a great deal of pet hair, dander and dirt from our carpets.  Emptying the canister is not as easy as the Dyson, but not terribly complicated.  The recoil cord option is great, I hope the mechanism has longevity.  Overall I would say for $125.00 this was a great deal!!!
This is the best vacuum I have had so far!!!  I recently purchased this vacuum after careful consideration and I am very happy that I did. I have had a few cleaners - most recently the Rainbow which was okay - I have allergies so the water system was good at catching all that junk I vacuumed up - however, I found that system to be cumbersome - too much switching around to clean and too much work, not to mention heavy and a lot of stuff to store. This Hoover is lightweight, compact, very powerful! Also, very easy to get out of the box and use right away - just plug in the main floor hose and go! I love the retractable cord - great so my bunny doesn't get it - and also the dirt cup was very easy to rinse out and clean. The best part is the Hepa filter and all the extra stuff I get up that the Rainbow didn't! I feel that with an animal around, this vacuum is the best! The power is wonderful and I love just switching to floor cleaning without having to completely change out the hose to a new one. I think the price is great too - got mine on sale but the Rainbow is outrageous pricewise - all other vacuums have caught up now I think and are much cheaper! Don't listen to the naysayers on this site - there is no problem putting this machine together - it already is - and the dirt cup you just dump in the trash and rinse in the sink! I give this 5 stars so far!!!
Great lightweight vacuum.  Great vacuum at a good price. The small canister is a convenient bonus. This is my second platinum lightweight bagged vacuum. I'm using them in a small summer resort. I bought the second one because the first one that I bought last year is doing so well. They clean good, and my housekeepers love them because they are lightweight.
Beats dyson in every aspect  This vacuum is amazing. I have two little toddlers and they make a mess. Food everywhere. Cereal, crackers, crayons in pieces you name it. The $400 dyson I had was constantly getting clogged (expected with the make up of the debris) but where the shark really stands out is that it makes it really easy to unclog, it has EASY access to all the places where stuff gets stuck.
Love it bought 2  our cleaning ladies love it too  Love it bought 2  our cleaning ladies love it too
Sucks big time  Unlike a similar Hoover model I have, this one actually sucks up all the dirt and is easy to keep clean.
Great vacuum  Works fantastic. Easy to clean. Well worth the price
You can ignore the complaints about this one that make it sound horrible. I can't imagine having difficulty using this vacuum ..  I read a lot of reviews on a lot of vacuums. You can ignore the complaints about this one that make it sound horrible. I can't imagine having difficulty using this vacuum unless you are disabled or elderly. It works wonders on carpet. In the kitchen and bathroom I can turn off the roller brush and move seamlessly from floor to rug without sucking it up and it still gets everything clean. The hose can definitely stretch all the way up my stairs. I love that there are no filters. This vacuum is the real deal.
So glad to have this.
works very well  just a great vacuum!
Super clean, zero dust.  I bought this to clean my new home prior to moving in. It worked better than any vacuum I have ever used. It was a little more complicated to use at first but the cleaning power made up for it. Dust was non existent after a thorough cleaning.
Hoover  Easy to use and light weight. Does a great job! Thanks for the new updated version of my old one.
LOVE This Vacuum!  I absolutely love this vacuum! I am extremely please, especially considering the price was so reasonable!  This vacuum is extremely easy to put together, and comes with user-friendly manual and directions. It is lightweight and easy to operate. I have 3 indoor dogs; pet hair has always been a problem in my house. I live in a remolded 1940's farm house with original wood floors; the remainder of my house has mostly tile flooring. I am very picky about what I use to clean my floors. It is often difficult to get all the dust and hair up, especially out of the crevices in the wood flooring. This vacuum works very well on my wood, tile, and carpet areas. You can adjust between surface levels with a turn of a switch. The hose attachment is perfect for corners and crevices. The pet hair brush attachment also worked wonders getting pet hair and fuzz off my couch. Emptying the vacuum is also very simple, and doesn't require you to get your hands dirty. The on/off button is great because it is right by your thumb and does't require bending/stooping. The retractable cord is also a great feature. Vacuuming is so much easier and more effective with this Hoover.  Cannot say it enough, LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!
but me & my girlfriend like how much dirt & dog hair it picks up  Only have it for a couple days now, but me & my girlfriend like how much dirt & dog hair it picks up, it's very light weight to carry and do stairs, feels kinda cheap but so far we feel like it's a good choice for the price
excellent machine, my wife thinks it is the BEST. Great on both carpet and floors.
comes highly recommended  I spent days looking for a bare floor vacuum, I finally settled on this one. The price was right and the reviews were spot on! This is an awesome product. One of the best vacuums I have ever owned short of my 20 year old rainbow. Like people have mention the cord is short, but I have multiple outlets so it's not a problem for me. The vacuum is the absolute bomb. It does a fantastic job on my uneven hardwood floors. That's why I bought the soniclean. My animals shed like crazy, when I would use the dyson and I was still finding hairy dust bunnies. The suction is adjustable. it comes with many attachments-which work. No issues with this vacuum at all. It's my all time favorite. Can't recommend it enough.
Smart design, great quality!!  I didn't buy this here, but just had to write a review because it is worth the money!  We live in a 1,000 sq ft apartment and this is a great size. I don't really know about other reviews criticizing for its cord length- this is a "city" size, meaning it is for small apartments/houses.  I just vacuumed the entire apartment, and less than 1/4 of the bin is filled. I have long hair, and live with two dogs, and it's amazing how much dog hair the vacuum picked up! If you need to empty the bin once or twice in one use, you need to vacuum more often lol.  The suction is amazing! Great buy. We actually bought this on sale for $100, so I am very satisfied with this product.  Can't imagine having a vacuum that is not by Dyson.
I love it!  I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a light-weight vacuum.  If it lasts a year with regular use, I will be more than pleased.
Works Great, should have bought years ago.  Love it but don't forget to empty the waste water container of you will be sorry.  You can review the proper use of this machine on either the Hoover website or Youtube.  Very easy to assemble.
Pet hair is gone!  I am thrilled with my new Bissell vacuum. It was easy to assemble. The suction is impressive. I have white carpeting and real wood floors throughout my house with two large dogs. I was disgusted and amazed after I made one pass throughout my house. The clear canister was full! I haven't touch my Kirby since. The vacuum is relatively quiet. I used the brush and hair eraser tools and was impressed! I couldn't believe how well the brush fit into every nook and cranny. I couldn't resist putting the vacuum to the test in my vehicle. The results were impressive. I have recommended this vacuum to every pet owner I know since the 1st time I used it.
Awesome  Love it! Great for my kitchen!
Dirt and pet hair buster  Love it,  Easy to use and light weight. Great suction, pulls pet hair toward it instead of blowout it away. Both heads work great, one for your hardwood or tile floors the other for throw rugs.
This Vacuum was so easy to assemble not like other vacuums that are ridiculous  This Vacuum was so easy to assemble not like other vacuums that are ridiculous.  As far as performance this Dirt Devil is amazing.  I was shocked at how well it performed for the price.  You couldn't ask for a better vacuum for the price.  Also the fact it self propels is awesome.
Good machine!!!
Powerful  This is a Powerful vacuum love the accessories easy to hook up, not that expensive. Able to reach places with the long hose and attachments.
Love this vacuum  Love this vacuum!  It has great suction and comes with a lot of useful tools.  The cord is extra king so I don't have to keep unplugging it.  This is my third Dyson and probably my favorite.
GREAT PRODUCT!!!  I got this for Christmas last year and just have to let everyone out there know that I LOVE this vacuum for my wood floor and travertine. Having 2 batteries is a huge plus. I have 2 small dogs that don't shed much so I would understand if some rating it had it lose a few stars as some cats and dogs would fill ANY vacuum. BUT this is such a quick way to do a very thorough job of vacuuming either hard wood or my travertine floor. it's lightweight but still feels like a much more like a full size sturdy vacuum than those stick vacuums....the only reason I didn't buy another one this year is that I have been waiting for it to go on the deal-of-the-day and sadly it has not--or I've missed it :(  I've checked every day with sadly no luck....so those that are getting this vacuum for Christmas! It's a true joy and made my life so much easier to pull out without a cord and do very fast vacuuming before the small crawling grandkids show up to play........
Perfect for Pet Hair  I was looking for a vacuum that can keep up with my two short-hair dogs. The issue with dogs with short vs. long hair dogs is that the shorter hairs are small enough actually embed themselves into the fibers of our couches, rugs, carpet, etc. I knew I wanted a vacuum that can clean up pet hair well but I was surprised how much hair and dirt it picked up. Although we vacuum our house once a week, I was shocked to see how clean our carpet looked after we got this new vacuum! It's not super lightweight but it's not too heavy for a petite lady like me. The retractable cord is a nice feature, one my older vacuum didn't have. Worth the money.
a great vacuum no matter what the price.  it is obvious why Consumer Reports rated this as their highest rated vacuum for carpet.if you really want your carpets vacuumed thoroughly this is the one to get.  the automatic drive in both forward and reverse is a real arm saver and works very well.
Very Powerful  This vacuum is very small (looks bigger in photo). In fact I was hesitant at first. But, they pack a whole lot of power into this small canister.  It's just as powerful as the regular-sized uprights that I have owned! It easily stows away in the corner of a closet.  It's perfect for someone like me-- some carpet and a lot of hardwood and tile. Someone with a large house with a lot of carpet may require something with a rotating brush. My problem with uprights is that the rotating brushes always get stuck or a the belt breaks so quickly.  The great thing about this vacuum is that it's very simple. It has no rotating brush, only powerful suction.  And the best part: NO MORE SWEEPING! If you have small kids it's a must! Click on the floor nozzle petal for the floor brush and it thoroughly cleans the floor without blowing the dirt around like an upright! What a difference when moping!  My favorite part is that it's very quiet. My poodle and Chihuahua would get so scared from our old vacuum.  They don't even flinch when I turn on the Eureka Maxima. It's also very light, so those who have problems lifting this is perfect! I used to have to move my couch away from the wall- now I can easily maneuver the floor nozzle under furniture and other hard to reach places.  The only CONS that I can think of are that the cord is not as long as I would like.  The bag is also very small and needs to be changed often. You need to buy the bags online, being that most stores don't carry the type "T" bag.  That's it!
Replaced my Dyson  I purchased this item when my upright Dyson Animal bitthe dust after 2 years. This thing is aawesome!!! I have 6 children and a 150lb mastiff, so believe me, we tested it!! I needed something that could handle Cherrios, bread crust, chips, and the occasional semi damp items. This bad boy was more like a shop vac! It sucked down cherrios quicker then my 18 month old twins! No hesitation, no getting stuck in some poorly designed narrow hose, this beast even sucked up childrens socks! Thankfully they were spotted in the clear debries canister before I tossed them :) Large dog food, no problem! There are no rotating brushes, so when my 5 year old wants to help out, I don't habe to worry about injuries resulting from moving parts. Did it need a brush to fully clean? Nope! Its suction made it a bit harder to pull "against the grain" of the carpet, but never had to clean up after it. Even stubborn dog hairs were pulled out by thr very stiff bristles on the bottom of the head of the vacuume. Great item all around!
Good luck on cleaning ceiling fan blades  received a day early. This vacuum cleaner has so much suction, and  suction lowering during operation is not noticeable. One problem I see is if you want to use the attachment hose. There is so much suction that it is hard to stretch out the hose and clean. You are always fighting, trying to stretch out the hose to dust. Good luck on cleaning ceiling fan blades, or using the dusting attachment,  fighting it without tipping the vacuum cleaner over. It works excellent on carpets, and floors. Vacuum is also easy to clean. I love the vacuum cleaner even with that one flaw about too much suction for the attachment hose. I must say as well, the vacuum moves easy on the carpets when using. Still the best vacuum cleaner that I ever owned.
The BEST Vacuum Money Can Buy  I purchased my Dyson All Floors at COSTCO for $439.00.  I has an extra filter and a two year warranty.  I can without hesitation say it is truly the best vacuum cleaner I have ever used.  My wife is in total agreement.  It is very easy to assemble, weighs less than my Hoover Windtunnel, and is quite easy to manuever.  The amount of suction is remarkable.  I vacuumed a freshly cleaned carpet and the amount of dust, dog hair, carpet fibre that was vacuumed up was incredible.  The Hoover does not compare.  I have read the reviews and the majority (around 10 - 1) are positive, and I have to agree with them.  You will not find a better vacuum for pet hair.  We have a very, very large short haired dog that is constantly shedding.  The Hoover did a poor job picking up the dog hair (forget about picking it up if there was any dust or dirt in the collection bin).  The Dyson picks up everything and DOES NOT LOSE SUCTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I read another review that stated several inconsistencies regarding the Dyson advertising and supposed propaganda.  That guy was freaking nuts - a complete ahole.  Dyson is the best, I can find no negatives.  He seemed to be a negative, pessimistic, naysayer that probally finds fault at everything.  Go with the Dyson - you will not regret it.
Great little vacuum  I love this little guy! I have all hard floors (wood and vinyl) and this vacuum does a great job of cleaning them. As other reviewers have mentioned the cord is rather short, a problem easily solved with an extension cord. Since my house was built in the 40's, I often have to resort to using them anyway. I empty the dust bin after every use and tap the filter free of dust.
great product, great value  The Kirby vacuum we had spent a small fortune on 13 years ago finally went to its great reward and we were faced with replacing it.  After doing much research (including the very helpful reviews here at Amazon) we decided on this model.  After using it several times, we couldn't be happier.  It honestly cleans better than our Kirby ever did -- I can't believe what this thing picks up!  We have two kids who are in and out of the house constantly with their friends and a long-haired cat so there is plenty to clean up after.  The attachments are stored right on the vacuum so it's very convenient and easy to clean an entire room (blinds, furniture, baseboards, etc.) while you're vacuuming.  I don't think I will ever dust again -- I'm using the vacuum for everything and love how clean it is when I'm done.  We have a two-story home and we like it so much we bought another one to keep upstairs.  At that price, it was worth it.  It is no heavier than our Kirby was and I don't feel it's difficult to use at all.  We have frieze carpet and it feels soft and brand new every time we vacuum it now -- it really is amazing! The switch to bare floors is a little tricky -- you feel like you're going to break the lever because you have to push pretty hard -- but after you get the hang of it, it works really well.  My only complaint is that the hose could be a little longer to reach certain areas (high window framing, long flights of steps, etc.).  Save your money and don't buy more expensive models -- this one does everything you need in a vacuum (and more) for an awesome price!
Heavy, but heavy duty!  I purchased this vacuum after having been disappointed with a Hoover. The Hoover was a Dyson style knock off that didn't have any floor height adjustments and its suction left something to be desired. This Bissel is a bit heavy but it makes up for it in power. It filled the bin after I had already run the Hoover. The attachments work wonderfully and the retractable cord is a nice bonus. Very happy overall with a vacuum with great power at a great price.
Great Vacuum for Pet Owners  Love this vacuum it picks everything up the only thing that I would change is the position of the off/on switch.  Once you get use to where it is located your fine.
easy to use  This is the second one I've purchased. This was a gift for my brother.  It's lightweight. easy to use, does numerous jobs from carpets to curtains, spider webs, under bed dust bunnies etc. Perfect for a bachelor! It is however....LOUD, but he lives by himself, so no kids or pets are disturbed by it.
For the price is has got to be a 5 star  OMG what a bargain...it actually grooms the carpet.  I have a larger DirtDevil that is almost 4 yrs still in good shape (except for the cord) but is much heavier and it dosen't groom the carpet like this does.  This light weight vac is why I ordered it because it is light weight and the reviews were favorable and how can you go wrong at this price...I found it a little annoying to have to assemble (I'm not that handy) would have preferred if it was pre-assembled.  I love that this is a bagged vac...I will never ever buy a bagless again I went thru several of them several years back (all trashed) and in my opinion they are just awful to empty out..I love the ease of removing a bag so much cleaner.
Works great on hard wood floors  The vacuum works great. We have a dog that sheds a lot. This vacuum works great at picking up hair off of our hard wood floors
I'm so happy with this little vacuum  I'm so happy with this little vacuum. It's ideal for a house with no carpet. Does a great job cleaning the sofas!
GREAT VACUUM  THIS WAS A GREAT PRICE FOR A GREAT VACUUM. PREVIOUSLY OWNED A SHARK WHICH WAS OK BUT THE SUCTION ON THIS IS MUCH BETTER AS WELL AS THE DESIGN IS EASIER TO HANDLE.
This is the best vaccum ever.....the suction power its incredible!!!! loveeeeeee ittttt
Was easy to vacuum the stairs  I have two dogs and one cat. It picked up all the pet hair. Was easy to vacuum the stairs. Very satisfied.
ordered for my office and the cleaning lady loves it!
this little baby is even better!  My Miele died....this little baby is even better!
I love my Dyson vacuum because I have dogs who shed a lot, and it picks up their hair very well.
I <3 this machine!!  Having recently purchased a home my fiancee and I were unsure what sweeper to purchase.  We have two dogs and cat, and I have bad allergies.  The house was my grandmothers so she left three sweepers for us to use.  One was a Hoover Windtunnel, and the other two were well known brands.  I grew up with a Kirby which always did an amazing job, but was always heavy for me to use.  I'm only 5'2 and I don't have a lot of muscle mass.  I often had trouble sweeping between floors and sweeping stairs because of the weight.  A Kirby like my mothers also cost a pretty penny.  However, I wanted something that would get all of the dirt that was obviously not being sucked up by the hand me down sweepers, and that I could easily carry up and down the stairs.  So, we were considering a Dyson, Shark, or Kirby.  Finally, I got an email from Amazon that refurbished Dyson DC14s were on sale on Woot! for $189.  That made my decision for me.  I ordered the Dyson.  I have to say, I'm beyond impressed.  Many people complain that the hand tool is hard to use.  I however strongly disagree.  It's my favorite part of my Dyson.  The hand tool extends from what would be the handle of the vacuum.  I can sweep my stairs while leaving the main part of the Dyson at the bottom of the stairs.  I can easily sweep the ceiling corners in all my rooms.  With my moms old Kirby you had to detach several parts and unwind the belt simply to attach hand tools. This unit puts Kirby's ease of use to shame.  I never want a sweeper that doesn't have this feature!  This Dyson is not heavy by any means.  Seriously, if you have enough muscle to carry laundry, this is a piece of cake.  Plus, there's no need to hold it while cleaning stairs because the telescoping hand tool is sooooo easy to use!  Finally, my Dyson sweeps up so much dog hair, cat hair, and various dirt.  Just sweeping the bottom floor of my home produces a full canister which is stuffed with hair and dirt.  I run the sweeper about once every two days.  Other sweepers I had I would empty the bag about once a month.  So, it's quite amazing that so much dirt is collected just on every sweep.  However, this is not because the canister is too small.  I think it's the perfect size, and I love that all you have to do is press a button to empty it into the garbage.  My fiancee and I are always marveling over the amount of dirt/hair in the canister.  I have carpeted floors and laminate floors in my home.  This sweeper is very easy to use on both.  The only problems I've had is remembering to switch the dial to carpeted/uncarpeted floor ONLY when the sweeper is off.  If you try to switch while it is on, a loud noise results.  This is normal, and I've found it doesn't harm my Dyson as long and I then turn it off and finish turning the dial.  However, sometimes I just leave the dial on the carpeted floor setting while on the laminate floor and it still sucks the dirt up just fine.  In sum: if you want a lightweight, handy sweeping machine get this Dyson!!  I was nervous spending over 300 dollars on a sweeper, but after buying a refurbished 189 dollar Dyson, I have to say I will definitely buy a brand new model next time.  It's definitely worth it.  PS-I never write amazon reviews, but after telling my fiancee how much I love my Dyson after every use I decided it was time to write my first one!
For the price? Fantastic!  I can't believe how well a vacuum at this price works. I chose it because it had good rankings at Consumers Report, and they didn't let me down. I'm especially pleased with how well it removes pet hair from furniture using the brush attachment.  If you want bagless, if you want noise reduction, this isn't the vacuum for you. But if you can put up with changing bags occasionally and don't want to spend the extra $200-$400 to get a quieter vacuum, I heartily recommend this one.
I love this vacuum.  Gets rid of dog hair, easy pour out bin.
Love the Hoover floor cleaner  Love the Hoover floor cleaner, bought this to replace my Hoover which was 10 years old.  Cleans great drys the floor better than the last one I had. Holds more water, and very easy to use.
Love it works very well.
I love this Vaccum  I love this Vaccum,very nice,easy too put together,easy too expel of what it picks up,lightweight,picks up very swell,shipping was very good,nothing broken 
Great, vacuum for pet owners  Glad to have an upright vacuum again -- works wonders on my rugs.  I have two pets -- a jack russell terrier mix and a border collie mix. The border collie sheds all the time all year round it feels. We have a roomba which works wonders but given the random nature of it and the predictable nature of my dog's hair shedding we tend to still have a lot of hair laying around even when I let it run (sometimes it wakes me up so I shut it off -- guilty as charged).  The neat thing about this vacuum is that it's light weight so I can easily pull it out of the closet, does an awesome job cleaning my rugs, and there's nothing like knowing you've gone over a spot on the rug and know it's 100% clean. When I use my automated cleaning robot I never know where it may have missed so it's nice to have that assurance I got to the area.  It's also easy to unload and clean so I don't have any issues getting ready for the next cleaning.  I like the vacuum a lot, no complaints here.
This one has a much larger canister for BOTH clean and dirty water. By far  I had the previous model and I had to constantly refill the soapy water, and it was hard to attach and detach the canisters. This one has a much larger canister for BOTH clean and dirty water. By far, much easier to use. Also, the smaller base allows for cleaning in tight spaces. Should have upgraded along time ago!
It has a lot of power and does a great job on tile and carpet  It has met all our needs and it is extremely efficient.  It has a lot of power and does a great job on tile and carpet. I would highly recommend the Kirby Sentria II G10 to anyone.
No more buckets of dirty and clean rinse water to deal with.  Everythng it said it was.  My entire home is tile...  Does a decent job...touch up now and then with Swifer.
Fabulous Floor Find!  I recently replaced two floors of carpet with tile in my split-level house and scrubbing on my hands and knees was not an option anymore, and I'm not fond of mops of any kind. The first time I used this I knew I would have clean floors FOREVER because I will use this regularly and it's easy enough to use even for spot cleaning. Also, FYI, if you have carpal tunnel syndrome you're not supposed to scrub floors on your hands and knees; and I have two trigger fingers that keep me from wringing out a rag easily as well. This is also lighter than my vacuum cleaner so it's easier to carry around the house.
Love it  Love my new vacuum as much as you can love an appliance.  It works with pet hair and with 3 pets that is saying a lot.  Buy extra filters.  I did and haven't had to use them yet but I will in the near future.
This is a great vacuum! As a stress cleaner  This is a great vacuum! As a stress cleaner, it's relieving to see how well it picks up all dirt and pet hair
Does a good job and is relatively easy to clean.
I love Amazon and Eureka!  Vacuum works super great, you have to empty it after every use and sometimes in between because of it's small size but it's totally worth it! Get's up all the pet hair very very well!!
Perfect!!!  This is a great little vacuum!  Assembly: Easy-as long as you read the short, clear directions (with pictures). I was using it within 10 minutes of opening the box.  Size: small, which is great for me. I have a 2 bedroom villa style townhome, with tile everywhere but the bedrooms and stairs. This is a great size for me; but if you have a big home, or even a moderate-sized home with a lot of carpet, this may not be the best choice for you.  Handling: Easy again. It's light compaired to the big vacuums, but the high end of average for the little vacuums. I like it though, it self-propels easily and turns well. The only thing I don't like is you have to manually unlock the base (or "foot") from the upright position by holding it with your foot while moving the handle back/downwards.  Cleaning: You can't get much easier than this unit when it comes to cleaning it out- you push a button, and the container pops out. The top easily twists off, and you just dump it out. The filter has to be cleaned here and there too. It's just as easy to put it back in (unlike my last vacuum... ugh)  Effective? Absolutely. I have 3 cats- that shed allll the time. Chairs and sofas were a constant battle between us and the kitties... but now, we've WON! the power paw is especially great.  Value:  TOTALLY worth the money! As long as you don't have a huge house with wall to wall carpet, you should give this one a try!  UPDATE: OK guys- it's been 5 years, and this thing is still going strong! This is more than I even expected... so happy we made this purchase!
Great price!  I absolutely love this vacuum, it has amazing suction that won't wear out. I've had this vacuum for over a year and it's just as good as when I bought it.
Excellent Vacuum  This unit was a demo unit, but looked brand new, no dust dirt etc. @ $44 plus shipping it was a steal. It's a excellent unit, very quiet and well built with excellent suction. Really cleans and grooms the carpets well. The head is slim and easy to maneuver, and the light works well. Has little problem in picking up anything. The belt jamming reset button is a great feature, and prevents smoked belts. Very versatile and easy to use. The tools are a little odd, but seem to work with a little effort. I actually modified some old tools And a couple of the new ones)  to work with the hose-so no big deal. One minor draw back is that the main vacuum head doesn't like to stand up by it's self very well.  I have this along with a Hoover commercial  C1320 upright for my large carpeted walk in van. Both are clean and don't send dust into the air. As with both of these vacuums, spend the extra money on the cloth bags, it really make a difference in keeping dust out of the canister (and the outer bag of  the Hoover). The Kenmore may pick up a bit more embedded dirt because you can manually lower the height and really dig in with the bare floor setting (extra low) on carpeting. But after a bit of testing they seem to be fairly equal-so each seems well constructed and over all well designed, and built to last over the long haul in their respective use classes. A very good buy, when you compare it to the over priced Dyson's etc. My other choice would have been a Hoover canister vac, but could not pass this one up @ $44.
Absolutely fabulous!!!!  I should have bought this years ago ... instead I made the mistake and bought several cheapo vacuums over the years, none of them did the job and for the money I could have gotten a new Dyson (this one is refurbished by Dyson and they seemed to have done a great job). My dog sheds like crazy and it's almost impossible to keep up with all the hair in the house. Also we live in the country and automatically we just drag more dirt into the house and everything dirties up quicker.  Although I just recently vacuumed and swept the floors (I do it almost daily), the amount of dirt and dust and hair picked up by the Dyson, when I used it today for the first time, was just unbelievable! And I didn't even vacuum everything. I found the vacuum of my dreams. Nothing else will do for me.
BISSELL Lift-Off Floors & More Pet  I love this thing... it works great!  I love that it's light and I can move it around easily.  The swivel head is great to move around furniture and it helps to move to the next section when I do my little carpet.  I can do the whole downstairs before the battery runs out.  That's 2 bedrooms and a living room in wood, 1 bathroom in tile, 1 dining room, kitchen and family room in linoleum.  This guy works on all these floor types.  I have just a few throw rugs here and there and also bathroom rugs and this works great on them, too.  It's also very easy to empty out and clean!  I know I am keeping my floors much cleaner due to this machine.  It takes a lot of the work out of cleaning the floors and somehow makes it a bit fun.  *** UPDATE January 19, 2013 ***  I received a very nice floor vacuum for Christmas.  Honestly, it's very nice. It's very powerful and it works very well.  But, I find myself never, ever using it.  It's just too cumbersome.  It's heavy and it's hard to move around.  Plus, it's not battery operated so I need to plug it in to an outlet in each room I vacuum.  It's just too much work.  I am loving this Bissell more and more.  It's what I reach for when I want to clean my floors and my little rugs and I'm so thankful I have it.  It's so quick and light and easy to use.  My floors are cleaner now that I use this and I spend less time keeping them clean. I can't live without it now.
I LOVE IT! Amazing power! PERFECT!
good  A++, good product
So glad I purchased this vacuum.....  It took me along time to decide and I relied heavily on the reviews here on Amazon, but after going back and forth between this one a slightly cheaper one I went with this one.  I am so pleased with it. Looks great, works great, totally awesome. Overall a good experience after I got over the shock and horror of what was being pulled from my carpets. It was absoultely shocking....and completely horrifying.  I can't compare to anything other than the dinosaur I was using but while I know it is a little heavy and a little loud, neither bothered me. The ergonomic design alleviated the weight and I couldn't care less about it being loud.  Great purchase....
It works great. So light and comfortable to use  It works great. So light and comfortable to use. Major plus is that it can reach the corners and under the bed! Doesn't scratch up the floors and carpets.
He has a brain  When I opened the box and plugged in, the vaccum was not working. Then I put it back to the box. Next morning, I decided to give it a second chance. When I plugged in and push the power button, it started working! I guess the vaccum got inspired after whole night thinking and realized its value in this world. lol
great suction and lightweight
Perfect for that quick clean up.  Love this!
Great Vacuum  The Dyson DC35 cordless vacuum is pricy for a cordless vacuum but like most things for purchase, you get what you pay for. The DC35 is awesome. I initially purchased this vacuum so I could vacuum my car. After I noticed how versatile this little vacuum could be, I expanded its use to quick cleanups around the house and eventually at the office. There are two settings with the DC35, low and high. On low, which is perfect for about 95 percent of all cleanings, I can get about 15 minutes out of a fully charged battery. On the high setting I can get about 6 to 10 minutes of cleaning. The powered motor head works great for carpeted areas. Battery charge time takes about 3 to 4 hours so an extra battery on hand is useful if you need to go just a little bit further. The wall mount for the vacuum is great for charging the battery and keeping all the accessories and the DC35 up and out of the way when not being used.
love
It is light, deep clean, the carpet is very well and its price is convenient
Compact, powerful and QUIET!  I got one of these to replace an aging Dyson and could not be happier.  This thing is REALLY quiet (like a small hair dryer) and is super powerful given it's size.  It's basically a glorifed dustbuster.  You can buy a hose and hose adapter to fit on the suction port too and canister handle adapter so you can use this like a canister vacuum (which is what I've done) and just hold the main unit in your hand.  It's so light weight that just holding it in one hand and operating the wand/floor head in the other isn't bad at all  With a split level 3 story house, this makes tackling all those stairs MUCH easier than the dyson and the canister conversion use is actually a lot easier to do stairs quickly compared to the H1 set in it's default upright vac configuration.  The H1 itself gets 5 stars from me because it does what it does exceptionally well but the hose attachment adapter, hose and upright canister handle adapter cost almost as much as the H1 itself but (unsurprisingly) the accessories are all extremely high quality as one would expect from Miele.  For those interested in the conversion, you will need these 3 items.  Miele 03565460 Non-Electric Hose Handle - SKU: 12142 - $37 Miele Hose Mini Upright 03565351 - SKU: 4611 - $62 Miele Cone Adaptor 03615020 - SKU: 4650 - $21  I got them from www.centralvacuumstores.com since they are not available on Amazon.  All said and done, for the same price as the Miele C1 Classic Olympus, you have more flexibility in terms of configuration with the option to operate the device in the upright configuration for more compact use and storage or as a handy and portable canister vac that's easy to carry around with you in your off hand.
Saved us from the old vacuum thank you!!!  It could just be because our last vacuum was total garbage but I love this thing!
Great Vacuum  I love this Vacuum.  It's simple, light, easy to use.  The arm allows it to get underneath furniture unlike an upright.  It has strong suction.  I have all hardwood floors with large sisal rugs and it cleans well on both.  Emptying the bagless canister is very easy too.  I'd recommend it wholeheartedly.
Works great, light weight  Works great, light weight, works perfect on wood floors or tile, works as good as our previous professional floor cleaner at a fraction of the cost.
oh my gosh this vacuum SUCKS! i don't think my home has ever been cleaner! easy to tell when the canister is full, easy to eject the dirt - fantastic product and worth the $ - very pleased with this purchase
I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this vacuum!  OK - I am not the sort of person who gets excited about household appliances, but I am absolutely crazy for this vacuum!  My household includes a large indoor dog (who is very old and sprawls all over the floors all the time), an indoor cat, 2 boys, & 3 adults and I am SO confident that my carpets (and bare floors) are clean after I've used it.  The 40-foot cord is such a convenience I will never accept anything less ever again - I can plug it in just once and vacuum my entire 2000+ sq ft home.  It is very light & easy to push, and the thigh-height handles (front & back) make it super easy for me (or my kids...) to carry up & down stairs.  The height-adjustment controls on the handle are great - no more bending over to turn a knob on the vacuum head (whoever designed those is an idiot), and the suction on this thing is incredible.  The CLEAN/DIRTY sensor seems like a gimmick but I actually find it very useful and often notice that I go back over an area that I would've otherwise thought was already plenty clean.  It could do with an additional extender for the wand, but I just use the one from my old Hoover.  For less than $20 I highly-recommend you invest in the Hoover Turbine Hand Tool - it's well worth it and combined with this vacuum will make you feel like a carpet-cleaning Wonder Woman (or Super Man...).  My husband had bought this vacuum for his office and I borrowed it when our home vacuum started to poop-out.  I liked it a lot but still shopped around and compared this to other vacuums such as the Dysons and could not see that there was any advantage in spending another $300 for the Dyson unless you are extremely name-brand & style-conscious.  It's a vacuum, people, not evening wear.  I thought I'd keep my old vacuum so I'd have one for upstairs & one for downstairs, but after using this one I would not go back to my old vacuum if someone paid me to.  It's going out to the Goodwill.  I've been using this vacuum for a few months now and no problems at all.  I've just bought one for my mom, too and I'm certain that she will LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it as much as I do (and her house will be cleaner!)
Solid machine
Amazing product for not a lot of money  Best vacuum I've ever used. I recommend this vacuum to everyone! I've been using for almost 5 years and it still amazing suction and it really will keep sucking even if the container is full. I still get excited like a little kid when I see how much it picks up. My sister and mom were Dyson fans. I think because it had such a high price tag they thought it was better, but after using/seeing mine they both switched! Definitely would expect to pay more for the amazing quality, but happy its such a great price! We have a house in the middle of a corn field with lots and lots of dust with 2 adults and 3 dogs that shed a lot and this picks up eveything! Buy it, you won't regret!
Definite Buy  Pros My old vacuum was always dusty, this vacuum has multiple filters and no dust so my allergies are better. I have all wood & tile floors, along with 5 small indoor dogs. I vacuum daily and I love the suction power along with the floor brush, it picks up so much hair & dust.  Plus, it has cut my mopping times in half.  Every once in a while you suck up something such as an ear ring and you have to mess with the bag to find it, this bag less model allows me to dump in small plastic bag and look for the item I mistakenly sucked up.  This is by far the best vacuum for the money that I have ever had.  If fact, I wanted to buy another one for our vacation home but the sale was already over.  Cons Wish the cord was longer and there was a place to store the wand & small brush. I little heavier than my old vacuum but I gladly give that up for the suction I receive.
Really great and super fun toy!  My daughter absolutely LOVES this toy and plays with it all the time! It's great because it doesn't make noise unless it's being pushed, which is nice for parents:) It works great and was worth every penny:)
Works great  Wonderful vacuum. This is my second one as I gave the first one to my daughter. Love that it has good suction but is not too heavy.
So much power  Really works to take the cat hair out of the house.  Lots of power and so easy to maneuver it around the house.
Finally, a product that lives up to its advertising  This vacuum cleaner lives it to it's reputation. I thought that I kept a fairly clean place, but the first time I ran the Dyson on my rug, it brought up tons of dirt. Easy to use.
The best thing is it is not heavy and it can be adjusted
Super Vac!  This thing works better than vacuums I have paid 10 times as much for. I can't believe  how much dirt came out of my expensive rugs. My older canister vac wasn't doing jack compared to this powerhouse. And the price!!!!! Unbelievable. Get this one if  you want clean carpets/rugs.
This is the best vacuum I've ever owned it is so powerful  This is the best vacuum I've ever owned it is so powerful. The section is so great you barely hold the handle and it pull it self across the floor!!!! I'm so glad I purchased that I purchased this vacuum
SO good, will SUCKTHE HAIR OFF A CAT...no joke.  I had the original Hoover in Burgundy for 20 years!! It finally broke & bought a cheaper one...BIG mistake. Bought the original again now in a beautiful blue color. Please don't let the price discourage you, it will be the best investment you ever make.   One word of caution, DO NOT add those sweet smelling powered packets in the bag bc this machine pick. UP such fine material, you will mess up the bag. It will think it is more full when it's not. Plus,  it can clog it up. VERY easy to clean but replacing the belt is the ONLY drawback.
great vacuum.
Great
Fantastic Vacuum - Hoover  We brought this because of the reviews we read and they were right, it is a great vacuum and it is a bonus that it has a HEPA filter. We recently moved into a new apartment and my husband got very bad sinus in the new apartment, I think they may have had a cat there previously. Although the carpet looked clean I used the new Hoover on it and wow there was so much cat hair and dust it was amazing what it picked up and suddenly my husband no longer had sinus. It is easy to empty, the only down side is it is a bit heavy to push. It was also a great price on Amazon.
Good buy!  Great product
Great vacuum!  This is my favorite vacuum ever!  Huge suction power cleans carpets beautifully; it's lightweight and transportable; the automatic feature allows me to go from my plush living room carpet, to my ceramic tile in the kitchen, to wood floors in foyer with ease.  It also can vacuum the front entrance rug without sucking it up.  The separate canister vacuum is great too and wonderful for little pick me ups and getting dust bunnies and crumbs between full vacuuming.  This is a perfect set at a great price!
Do not pass this toy up  WE had it for months works perfectly my daughter loves do not pass this product up it stands up perfectly super fun for kids
Great Vacuum - Love It  I have a Shark - so why did I buy this model & brand? Well, it is always nice to have 2 vacuums in case the main one breaks. So, I did my research and purchased this model. WHY? Well, I love Amazon in the way you can read reviews, go and watch videos on YouTube and in my case - I went to Consumer Reports and low and behold this model was rated quite highly from them. So, first let me say why I really like this unit. First and foremost a vacuum must suck up dirt and stuff in your carpet and in your house or why have one? This unit does that at an affordable price $90.00. I first vacuumed my house with the Shark and then this model UH70120 - I was surprised to see more stuff in the dirt chamber after using the Shark. Emptying the dirt bin is easy but like any bagless vacuum you have to be careful or you will get a big dust cloud if you let the bottom open and drop to quickly. I like that fact ALL the attachment are on board with the vacuum and you don't have to go and search for them. The hose detaches easily from the unit so you can dust and clean high places or drapes. NOW, the only bad thing about this unit in general is the motor brush is always spinning - you can't shut it off. So, you have to be careful not to let the brush tilt forward in one spot to long when using. This is kind of bad when you use it on hard floors as the brush may push things or spit items along the floor. This didn't bother me. There are 2 filters on the unit - the one on the top is washable and one in the front which is a HEPA filter which is NOT washable. The vacuum has a sensor on board above the dirt bin which will turn red when it is time to clean the washable filter. I really like how you can easily change or fix anything if there a problem. If a belt breaks - the bottom opens up by sliding a bar and turning a red lever and the bottom comes right off. You could also clean these areas more regularly because it is easy to do. The WindTunnel unit is easily removed by turning the top counterclockwise and it pops off. You can then clean the inside of the bin and wipe off the WindTunnel unit. One really nice feature is the rewindable cord. You pull it out to the red label - then there is a pedal which will self wind up your cord. I am a guy and to me it is fun to use. You see the dirt and know it is cleaning your house. Are there better vacuums - yes I am sure there is - but for the price and features I think any one will love this vacuum. There are a lot of videos under the Hoover website that may answer some of your questions if you still have them. There is another model similar to this which is geared for if you have pets. I don't have any pets but I chose this one because of reviews and videos.
Refurbished very well. Would purchase from this seller again.
Love it  Love it works great.  Wish I could find one that would let you scrub moe before it sucks the water up.  But this one is great
Why the bad reviews? Here's why I love this  First off - I was anti Dyson for years since it first came out, I thought they were over priced fancy schmancy and uselessly over engineered.  I live in a 700 SQFT with a Shag / High Pile carpet for which I just assumed Dyson wouldn't work on these types of carpets.  So I used my old eureka broom vac for a while, it was small and just good for vacuuming dust, hair and scraps on the hard wood floor, useless on the carpet.  I searched High and Low for a good vacuum and ended up getting (and returning) the Carpet Pro CP-1T, for about $250. Based on the stellar reviews i thought this was the one that would solve all my vacuum related problems.  I returned it because it wouldn't, couldn't move on the shag carpet.  Either it was too powerful, or just not designed well enough to roll over carpets, especially shag.  I literally could not move the dang thing.  I had to painfully lift it over the carpet so that it hovered over it, after about 20 minutes of vacuuming, my back went out painfully.  Secondly the tools were useless, the 'extension hose' was no more than 3 ft and kept tipping over the vacuum, and the bristles can't turn off even when using the tools, which was dangerous if it tipped over the exposed bristles can cause (and did) injuries, which it scraped my hand pretty bad.  Anyways, I realized I need something that was designed to 'roll' over anything. So I found this Dyson on sale for BlackFriday and I said why not.  If a 5 Star rated vacuum couldn't do the job, then what's to lose on a 3 star Dyson.  Well I'll tell you what, the Dyson is phenomenal.  here are the reasons why I love it:  1)It rolled over my 2 inch shag carpet almost effortlessly.  2) It's so light and compact at only 11 lbs,I have no issues storing it away in my tiny apt.  3)I love how the bristles disengage on hard wood and becomes a broom vac.  It made vacuuming room to room on multi floor types so easily.  4) Lastly, the tools, tho limited on this model, was plenty.  the hose comes out about 4 ft, and with the extension rods, its about 6 ft and can assemble it while its on in about 5 seconds.  While they've improved this design in the newer models, I have no complaints.  I emptied an entire canister of dust and garbage in my first day.  Much relieved to know all that was living in my carpets. My only gripe is the extension hose could be longer (again, they've improved this on newer bigger models, but not for this perfectly small DC 24 model)  All in all, I love this dyson and I've become a fan.
Super Fast Shipping  love it the shipping was super fast and I can only say so far everything is working perfectly
Excellent machine  I drug a canister around for 20 years, assembling and disassembling every time I went from bare floor to carpet.  I'm delighted with this upright.  It does a marvelous job on both.
Really Sucks  I recently purchased this vacuum and it performs better then i expected. the self propelled feature works well on carpets with little effort. Consumer reports gave it one of there top ratingsas well they should. I also purchased the 20 foot extension for stairs and longer reach places without moving the vacuum whhitch makes it very easy to clean. I would recommemd this to anyone who is lookig for a good allround  vacuum.
Outstanding  This is probably the most efficient floor cleaner on the market as it vaccuums, washes and dries floors.  Works well on all hard floor surfaces and is easy to assemble and clean. My floors never looked so good.
We love this vacuum  I bought this for my cousin who is confined to a electric wheelchair which brings in lots of dirt and debris on the tires.  She has all tile floors and several cats.  We love this vacuum.  The extra pet hair attachments are wonderful for the furniture.  It is much more powerful than I expected.  I love the compact size with the cleaning power of a large vacuum.
Great little vac for tile floors!  I replaced my 10-year-old Mighty Mite with this one after it's motor just gave up - think it overheated during a marathon vacuuming experience.  After investigating the new generation of vacs (you can spend a lot!) this time I upgraded to the Pet Lover, with a tiny beater bar gizmo to help with cat left-overs on sofas and other fabric...though sadly don't have a kitty on whom to test it just yet.  Another improvement appears to be a slightly remodeled, beefier wand, which was pretty lightweight (in the bad sense) on the original. But like its' predecessor, this hoovers madly on my all-tile floors, and is so light and easy to move around and store.  On the down side, it is loud (is there a quiet vacuum?), the cord doesn't retract (though there seems to be more room for it on the  coiling hooks under the unit), and the hose appears to be made with the same material that ended up being duct taped here and there after a few years of abuse.  But with no carpeting, at the cheap price and in purple, how can you go wrong?
Love, love, LOVE  I have a German Shepherd, 2 cats and 2 children (age 2 and under). I absolutely love the performance of my Shark, it's perfect for me to carry up and down my steep stairs and literally picks up everything when filters are cleaned regularly!
I like the vacuum  I have back issues so this self propelled vacuum is exactly what I was looking for.  I like the vacuum.
A Real Vacuum  Now when we vacuum, there really are clean carpets.  Notice huge difference throughout our home.
This is a great vacuum!  This vacuum is awesome - light, super-powerful, EASY to empty, has a washable, REUSABLE filter (!), and works like a dream. Very long cord. Very versatile when you use the accessories that come with it. Does not lose suction. Really fantastic buy for the price! I only wish it had a retractable cord, that's the only drawback.
LOVE IT  Okay I'm a college student and I hate to clean so getting a vacuum was ehhh for me. but i LOVE IT. it looks like a spaceship and it is so SO COOL i had an old charge shark and it sucked - in the bad way. it does collect a lot of hair that gets stuck around the roller in the bottom - i have to cut it with scissors which is kinda gross but i guess its expected because i live with three other girls and we have a lot of hair so eh, i guess it comes with the territory. it is corded, which i can't decide if i like - no charging, yeah, but it does limit you. but I'm lazy enough to get a little grump when i have to unplug it and move it. first world problem really
THIS IS BETTER THE THE EXPENSIVE ONE WE BORROWED AFTER OURS BROKE  Purchased this to replace another less expensive Red Devil Vacuum, costing $36.95 four years ago, and used weekly broke, which did a very good job. Ordered Sunday afternoon around 6PM, the vacuum arrived on 1ST Tuesday, easily assembled, and was surprised how good this was. Noticed it was easier to use and did a better job the the $299.00 vacuum we borrowed from our son's wife. My wife was very pleased ,  so happy wife, happy life!
I have a bad back its much easier to vacuum now  the vacuum clean just glides across the floor . I have a bad back its much easier to vacuum now.
Great for a toddler  Our granddaughter loved "helping" mommy with this vacuum.  She was afraid of the vacuum cleaner sound until she got her very own tool  We loved the size and durability of this model.
Great vaccum.....very powerful!
Great machine. Light and powerful
Can't beat it for the price.. Very powerful.
Best Hoover yet...  My first brand new vacuum - unusual to say at age 46, but I've always inherited my mom's cast-offs (always Hoover) which have always lasted for years.  This vacuum is primo.  Suction is great and the auto rewind cord is awesome.  I like the on/off switch being foot controlled (toe controlled) - it's just well designed and easy to handle.  I think the folks who were burning up belts just needed to adjust the "carpet height" knob - it is pretty sensitive. I experimented starting with the highest (least pull) and ended up at 3 for my carpeted rooms and area rugs.  You just can't go wrong here.  I recently repaired a friend's Dyson (dog chewed the plug off the end) and was amazed at how cheap and flimsy it felt compared to this new Hoover (or any of the other Hoover's I've owned). Hard to believe folks would pay upwards of $400 for a vacuum when you can get something like the Hoover Elite for $100.
Hate to admit that I should've listened to my husband 5 years ago!!!  I have issues with my strength and energy levels.  We have a split level home and many carpeted stairs!  We also have a black cat with white living room couches and champagne carpets!!!  I had read many reviews on many machines and had tried out a Miele and other great machines.  We have bought many vacuums in the 5 years we have been married and each time I have complained at the price so spending this amount on a vacuum was a BIG deal to me! I was concerned about the weight of this vacuum and thought "really?  Why buy a Dyson just for the hype of doing it???"  My husband bought it and he told me that he bought it and I had no choice in it!  When the box arrived, it was easy to assemble the vacuum.  I vacuumed with our Miele for days before the Dyson arrived, determined to prove that Dyson was all just a big hype and there was nothing special about this vacuum.  I turned the Dyson onto our carpets.  Starting first at the stairs to prove I didn't have the strength to handle the Dyson on stairs... I failed!  I didn't even use and attachment for the stairs, I was able to hold the canister handle and vacuum all the stairs without an issue.  I emptied the canister... I had a point to prove!  I vacuumed my daughter's room and the upper level.  When my daughter was 2 years old, I used sprinkle vac powders to "freshen" the carpets and make everything smell good.  I would vacuum a few hours after sprinkling the powder down.  When I put the Dyson to the upper level, I was extracting the sprinkle vac powder from TWO YEARS AGO!!! (this made me upset because it further stopped me from proving the point that Dyson is all "hype")  The carpets on the upper level felt soft and fluffy, like they were spotlessly clean, this didn't make me happy!  I emptied the canister again because it was full.  I vacuumed the rest of the house with the same results, having to empty the canister at the end of each level!  The machine did not and COULD NOT lose suction!?  I was rather upset that the Dyson was not just hype, it was a good vacuum.  Before we got the Dyson, I would vacuum the whole house after wiping down each surface and vacuuming all floors too.  There is nothing I hate more than cleaning, vacuuming and mopping the whole house just to walk in the kitchen and feel tiny bits on my bare feet MINUTES after cleaning the whole house.  It would drive me totally batty that I had done all this work on the house to still have bits on my feet!  Since the Dyson, I vacuum the whole house, vacuum the wood floors to remove all gritty bits on the floor.  I do not even have to mop/swifter to remove all the gritty bits!  Now I vacuum the whole house and the floors(all floor surfaces) are gritty bits free by the time the Dyson is done with it!  Having all the attachments available on the machine make life VERY simple.  The long cord allows me to only unplug and move ONCE during my vacuuming rather that for each level.  The attachments are able to reach high corners and every little crack.  I hate to admit but the Dyson is not just hype.  It works very well and I must admit that I really do not know why I waited this long to get one!!  To admit it publicly is going to kill me but... I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO MY HUSBAND FIVE YEARS AGO!!!
Could not be happier!  I am so pleased with my new vacuumes.  The carry around is the best for my hardwood floors and hard to reach areas. Both items are very light and I have to say make the act of vacuuming as pleasurable as it can possibly be.
Magic!  I've been using a shark steam mop, and my swifter for small clean ups. Trashed them both today after receiving this! Ok, I didn't trash my sifter because I still love it, but I did rehome my shark! Posting a video of three hour old, dried up ketchup. This thing is amazing. I couldn't believe how dirty the water was, I JUST cleaned my floors yesterday! This even got some paint off of my daughters floor where we repainted this week. I'm overly pleased!
Great vacuum and customer service  We have had this vacuum for over a year and really like it. Does the job as both a stand-up or handheld unit. The charging base stopped working for some reason, and I contacted their customer service and they sent me a new one, and could not have been more helpful. I have recommended this vacuum to a lot of people.
Super easy assembly and use  Super easy assembly and use.  I just moved in after renovations and plaster dust everywhere.  This little machine cleaned up my hardwood floors, window sills, furniture, everything, so well.  I would buy this again even if given my choice for a more expensive machine.
Best Vacuum I ever owned and great for pets  We recently purchased this vacuum and have owned Orecks, Hoovers and many others before.  Nothing compares.  We have the Turbo Nozzle and it picks up the tons of hair from our carpets like nothing I have ever seen.  This vacuum with its attachments has our home cleaner than it has been  since we got the yellow lab (those with these sweet dogs knows there is hair EVERYWHERE.  I would recommend this vacuum to anyone, it is working great on our low pile wall to wall carpets, area rugs (we have a bunch) and on the hardwood floors.  Going to order the miniturbo brush soon to get more hair out of the furniture.
Good value and gets the job done  Shipped quick. Great little canister vacuum. Lightweight, plenty of power cord that retracts. I use it on hardwood floors, tile floors, uncarpeted stairs, and short rugs; doesn't scratch. Easy to empty. Would recommend getting a replacement filter. Don't think it would be good for regular carpet.
Floor mate did an excellent job of cleaning the kitchen and bathroom tile floors
Like the Eureka 4870GZ Boss Vacuum  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009WRKSY/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title  This vacuum has desired attachments and really solid power for pulling  up unwanted stuff.  It is heavier than I might have guessed, but it is  solid, flexible, inexpensive and does the job!  What more can one want?
NO JOINT PAIN!  I love this vacuum, and can't believe I waited so long to purchase one!  Amazon was way cheaper than Target and it arrived two days after I ordered it!  I have rheumatoid arthritis, even had all the knuckles in my right hand removed a few years ago, so vacuuming has always been a major chore for me!  Especially since I have to do it often because I have a black cat!  As soon as I pulled the Dyson out of the box, and put a few things together (very easy and quick), I knew it was perfect for me!  It was so light, I couldn't believe it and it cleaned better than any vacuum I had ever owned!  Sucked up all the black cat fur, and moved around and under furniture like a dream!  The canister was very easy to empty as well. And this thing picked up dirt that I didn't even know I had! My carpet looks BRAND NEW! I look forward to using this once a week, and am extremely happy with it.  I'm bragging about it to everyone!  I highly recommend it!  My joints are no longer sore from simply vacuuming. I'm so glad I got it, really worth the money!
Happy with my purchase.  So far so good! This vacuum has definitely impressed me. I have a golden retriever (has long hair) and this thing picks up the hair no problem! I like how it works on hard wood floors and carpet. I couldn't believe how much dirt this vacuum picked up!
Great Vacuume!!  Very good vacuume!! It has great suction and very east to empty with just a button!! And the cord rewind is excellent on this vacuume!! Just push a button and cord rewind itself!! I love it!!
while it was great in the RV  I purchased this unit for my RV, while it was great in the RV, no cords and did a great job, we have moved it to the house, its great 2 batteries always ready.  The house is 1500 sq ft. and I generally can do the house 1.5 times and then I just swap batteries, Its great because it goes full power till it shuts off. no cords,  I am about to buy my first filter, I was just admiring how well the Hoover Air Cordless has been doing, I figured i Would write a review.  It is the 2nd best vacuum I have every bought, the best I ever bought was a Meile.
Geast price and good quality. Lots of power, easy to use, light weight and dependable.
Powerful and picks up better than previous brand name vacuum.  Best vacuum cleaner I've ever used.
Amazing at Cleaning Under Furniture & Beds!!  Tackled All Pet Hair & Dander  This is our 2nd Dyson. We've had the upright pet model for 12 years and it still works great.  With that older model, however, we were always moving furniture and beds to vacuum underneath.  So we decided to go with a canister vacuum and to stick with Dyson.  This model is fantastic!  It has much more suction than our upright and easily cleans all of the pet hair and pet dander under our furniture and beds.  The roller ball on the head allows us to turn the handle to the side to get further underneath the furniture & beds.  With this model, the tools are easy to change out, even while the vacuum is running, because the hose already is extended.  With our upright, we had to turn it off, pull the house out and attach the tools, then re-stow the hose to vacuum upright again.  But now we can do the main part of the floor with the cleaning head, quickly switch to the crevice tool, then switch right back to the cleaning head.  Also, this is much quieter than our upright.  And the suction is amazing! I am baffled by some of the reviews that said the vacuum would not pick up leaves and "jelly beans."  When you have a vacuum with this much suction, it is going to stick to the floor and get all the fine particles and suck up all dog fur.  We have two long-haired dogs and one cat.  That's why we bought this vacuum--to get under furniture without losing any of the super suction power.  For leaves and dog kibble, just tilt the head up a little so it can catch the leaves.  Small effort for large items when your floors and carpets are getting so clean so deep down because of the powerful suction.  The one drawback that I read in the reviews that I have to agree with is that on really tight pile bumpy rug with a design woven in, it bumps around a little and doesn't have great coverage without a little more effort.  Our old upright is much heavier at the head, so it stays tight on that rug.  This one is so light at the head and it's trying to make a tight suction, but this particular rug has a design woven into it--it naturally is a bumpy rug.  So the machine has trouble making a tight suction.  It works, you just have to take it a bit slower.  BUT, for hardwoods and tile, it's amazing and better than I hoped!  For medium pile carpet, it is fantastic.  This one has a larger head, larger collection container, longer cord, and much more suction power than the DC47, so I would recommend it over that model.  It's a whole house vacuum cleaner, not just an under-the-furniture vacuum cleaner.  We've moved our upright into the basement and we use this new canister for the rest of the house.  We love it!!
Love the DC39  Love the DC39.  My Mother was a diehard supporter of her brand of vacuum which finally quit working.  I had her try my Dyson and then got her one for her birthday.  She loves it!  Very easy to maneuver around, lightweight, and the suction power picks up everything.  Highly recommend.
I recommend this vacuum for anyone who cannot handle a heavy one. Or anyone!  Great lightweight vacuum! This is easy for me to use with my arthritis and bad shoulder. It picks up dog hair amazingly! Only downside I can see is it sucks up so much stuff so fast, you have to empty it every minute or 2! It is really easy to empty though, I like how you snap the container off the vacuum and it is a sealed unit until you get to the garbage can!  I actually vacuumed with this right after I had someone use the big vacuum in the living room, then I ran this one and it picked up a ton more hair and silt! I hope it continues to work so well. So far I have had it a few weeks, and it is great. And no, I didn't get this free for a review, I bought it.
Excellent Part-Time Vac  So far so good.  Replaced an Electrolux Ergorapido and the Hoover is far superior.  Love the swappable battery feature and can do quick clean-ups in half the time.  We mainly use to vacuum kitty litter after cat potty breaks and for other small messes.  Does a great job on carpet and tile.  The hard floor brush roll works great.  So far have been able use 8 to 10 times (a few minutes at a time) before needing to swap the battery -- one battery charges while the other is in use.  Would highly recommend the Air Cordless, especially at the Amazon price.
Great if you have pets that shed!  This is simply the BEST vacuum cleaner I have ever owned.  I searched around to find the best rated vacuum for picking up dog hair and this came out on top.  It has great suction.  I have a long haired dog that sheds constantly and I am so happy I found this vacuum cleaner.
No Cords, No Hassle, No MESS!  <div id="video-block-R3KMU2R4HB1745" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1YCZrfR8iS.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91CURkRMLLS.png" class="video-slate-img-url">&nbsp;This vac is an absolute champ on hard floors, sucking up anything from dog hair to the tiny shards of glass that the broom leaves behind after sweeping up a broken glass. Yes, I confess, I'm a butterfingers. Putting it together is a snap, but I did have one issue. After the first unscrewing of the waste receptacle, it would NOT go back on, no matter what I did. The manual has a link to go to, which redirects to YouTube. Although I didn't find an answer, I did find a whole slew of videos done by the Hoover company for this product. Anything you want to know is there, in easy to understand video. EXCEPT for my problem. Finally, I figured out that the inner core, which had removed with the top attached to it, actually needs to be placed on the collection receptacle, and THEN screwed in. I had been trying to screw it in with the core attached to the TOP.  The battery charger is beautifully designed, but an award should go to the team that designed the box this whole unit comes in. It unfolds like a fine jewelry box, a lot larger, of course.  But what really matters is how it cleans. It's very good on carpet, and excellent on hard floors. The washable filter catches small particulate matter. Despite being battery operated, it works beautifully. This is no Dustbuster type, this is a real full size vacuum. It would be fine as your only household vacuum.
Works great, arrived quickly.
I LOVE this vacuum cleaner!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this vacuum cleaner.  After Christmas I was putting out house back in order and the vacuum cleaner we have kept clogging and/or had NO suction.  I was so fed up I went online and started looking for a new one.  One of the 1st things in this ones description was "No Clogging".  I read several reviews and I noticed that a lot of people that had heavily shedding pets loved it  It is all true  NO CLOGGING!!!!!!  I even accidentally sucked up a pen and it was still picking up other stuff before I could turn it off.  We simply unattached the clear suction tube (love the clear tube), took the pen out, put the tube back on and went back to vacuuming.  So easy.  It deals great with all the dog hair from our German Shepard.  NO CLOGGING!!  Keeps suction.  Easy to empty the canister  The design is great!
Im really happy with the purchase It is small and you can wash the filters, is amazing! Definitely Il Recommend the product!
Exactly as described
Very good.
Best vacuum for pet hair  2 german shepherds and this thing is a beast. Best vacuum I have outta 4 . Easy to clean  has multiple applications.
Eureka Mighty Mite  This is a great little vacuum! It's easy to use and very powerful. We have animals in the house and it gets all the dust and hair from the hard floors and kitchen with ease. I also have an old Mighty Mite that's about 15 years old and it works like new. I had to have a new on/off switch put on but it still works great also. It's the best canister vacuum I have used.
Canister Vac  We had an Oxygen bought before Electrolux owned,loved it for HEPA, but it required too much duct-tape to maintain.  I knew that Electrolux would make good improvements.  LED lights are GREAT, powerbeater is quiet, It is a small lightweight but powerful canister like we need, since we have so many things to vacuum under.  The ONE FOOT wide (yes!) bare floor attachment is TOO wide, but we've learned to work with it.  As expected, Electrolux redesigns in such a way that no other make tools will fit, so we lost some flexibility there. Highly recommend it.  Would still buy it again.  Couldn't find in stores, so Amazon once again!
So far this vacuum is wicked awesome  Our old vacuum sucked...or didn't suck as the case may be. It literally would go over the carpet and it would sort of ball up some of the dirt so you could pick it up and throw it away. Really annoying. The new Bissell was night and day by comparison. Super easy to use, super easy to clean, I really love the retractable cord, no bags - just pull and dump. Easily cleaned filter. And we have three cats in the house so knew the old vacuum wasn't getting everything. Little did we know - the Bissell was jam-packed from picking up all the hair. Brilliant. So far I'm extremely happy with this vacuum. Had it for about 6 weeks now.
Fantastic at removing dog hair  I have two dogs with short hair who shed a lot. I vacuum and clean my house quite a bit, but it always seems like I can't get enough of the dog hair out of the carpeting for it to feel really clean and sanitized. I bought this vacuum after reading several round ups of the best vacuum cleaners for getting dog hair out of carpeting. This brand/model consistently came up so I went for it. When I first opened up the box, I vacuumed a small section of my living room and half the canister immediately filled with dog hair and dirt that my other vacuum didn't get up (I'm trying to avoid thinking how long we've been breathing that stuff in). I vacuumed an area rug that seems to hold on to little hairs and fuzz like velcro and it's completely spotless. I only just got this item so I can't speak to its durability but thus far I'm thrilled with how well it works. Yes, it's a little loud, but it's a vacuum cleaner--I don't expect it to be quiet. Totally worth it.
Cleans great, parts wash easily  Wish it had a retractable cord. but other than that our vacuum is running great 2 years later. Washing the parts is super easy. We do not have any pets but we are in and out constantly and have a woodstove in the winter that produces a lot of dust. I also do a lot of arts and crafts.
Love This Vacuum Cleaner  i bought this vacuum cleaner used which was in great shape. i got a great deal on it and it came in the condition that was stated on amazon's web site. i love this vacuum cleaner because of it's convenient size and the power it has for it's size.
Great product!!
WOW!  I've had my Dyson for two weeks now, and I'm still in awe!  It cost twice as much as my first car and half as much as my second, and it is worth every penny!  The design is nothing short of brilliant, it's easy to use, and emptying the dust collector is neat.  And it's quiet enough it doesn't send the dogs into a panic. I do recommend looking at the Dyson website and watching the animated instructions before you open the box. It'll make assembly less intimidating (it's easy, but it doesn't look it on first glance). I've sold three friends on Dyson in the first week, and as my neighbor said "so powerful it'll find Osama Bin Laden." My only regret is not acting sooner.
and it still works but is getting pretty beat up  We had one of these for 12 years, and it still works but is getting pretty beat up.  Bought this one to replace it and I'm sure it will do as well
Best vacuum ever!! I now vacuum everyday.
great vacuum  This is my 2nd dyson. I got an  upright 12 years ago when we got our first Bernese Mountain Dog. He's passed away but the Dyson is still going strong. We recently got another Berner so we got a canister Dyson for the first floor which is mostly hard floors or low pile carpet. Now we have the canister for upstairs which is wall to wall carpet and the canister for downstairs. The canister is lightweight and easy to maneuver. It sucks up masses of berner fuzz off carpets and hard floors, and furniture. It's easy to empty and store. It has a nice long cord and I can do two of my large rooms without unplugging and moving the cord. It reaches most of the way up the stairs without picking it up. I do the last few stairs from upstairs with the canister hose.
I would recommend this cleaner.  This is my 5th floor mate.
Easy to use  The vacuum is a lot lighter and it has a longer cord. It's also quieter than my previous Dirt Devil.
Electrolux  Intensity Vacuum  Since purchasing the Electrolux Intensity vacuum cleaner I have vacuumed more often than with any vacuum cleaner I have owned.  It is so easy to take out, carry around and operate.  I like the controls high on the handle to change from bare floor to carpet cleaning in an instant.  It does a good job of cleaning the floors.  The only drawback is that it does not fit under furniture.  Other than that, I am completely satisfied with this vacuum cleaner and would recommend it to anyone.
Works great, floors are clean and dry.
No complaints here!
Great experience  Wow what a great price!!  And it came with papers from Dyson detailing their refurbishing process. And it came with the full complement of attachments!! The vacuum works great!! Im happy!!
Dyson DC25 totally rocks!  I read the reviews in amazon.com and also got a high recommendation from a neighbor.  The order came quickly, it was very easy to put together, and though I had vacuumed the day before (I have a shedding rabbit), I wanted to test drive my new vacuum.  It picked up a ton of fur that my old machine didn't, and the rug looks new again!  I will never buy another brand again -- this Dyson totally rocks!
Love it!  I love this little vacuum! I have gone through other pet vacuums from major brands and this is by far the best one. It's light and small and very smooth. It doesn't get clogged with my two dogs and cat's hair.
Best vacuum I've ever used  I never thought that I would enjoy vacuuming. I also didn't expect to notice a change in the way my house smelled immediately after using it. I've owned Hoover and Bissell but they utterly fail to compare. I'll never use anything else again.
Excellent! Quieter than I had expected. Easy to empty.
I have several pets and I was amazed how well it vacuums up the pet hair  This vacuum has exceeded my expectations. Extremely powerful and maneuvers well. I have several pets and I was amazed how well it vacuums up the pet hair. I would buy this machine again.
Slow actions for excellent cleaning  Excellent cleaning.. unlike many reviews.. i noticed that if you hurry up and try to use it as fast as vacuum cleaner, some water is left behind. Use it slow and steady.. it mostly sucks back water on pull back.. So.. cleans and puts water and scrubs while going forward and pulls everything back when going backward. So parallel actions are required. Not perfect.. but at this stage.. really good.
love  Absolutely adore this machine. It's like getting down and your hands and knees and scrubbing the floor gently, but without all of that work. Easy to clean and you don't really need to add any detergent to the very warm water that you put in it in order to get floors clean.
I hate mopping!  Easy to use and gets my floors nice and clean.  Way better than a mop!!
Great vacuum cleaner  I saw an advertisement on this cleaner and it is as advertised. Good, quiet sound, lots of vacuum, easy to cleanout, lightweight, great shipping speed. No complaints at all.
Good product.  Really like this vacuum.
Extremely happy to replace my old upright canister vacuum cleaner  Extremely happy to replace my old upright canister vacuum cleaner. The compact design and lightness of the overall vacuum while pushing makes it ideal for a quick vacuum without feeling like you're working out. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles like other products, but it's simplicity is also what makes it attractive. It's also a huge benefit that it is a canister design, so you don't have to waste money purchasing replacement bags.  Excellent product, and one that should last for quite some time to come.
much power for such a small and economical machine, works very well for pet hairs
I love this vacuum  I love this vacuum. It works so great for my needs. It picks up a ton. I have a cat and I use the crystal cat litter. This picks it up really well. I had an issue with a superball and Shark replaced my whole vacuum in 3 days for free!
Love the product works great
Great replacement unit
Really excellent vacuum at a decent price  Really excellent vacuum at a decent price. This is actually my second (ex took the first and I liked it enough to buy it again). Plenty powerful, pretty light, doesn't clog, easy to empty. What more could you want?
Love this vacuum!  Love this vacuum, it's relatively light weight, has a long hose for vacuuming corners of walls, crevice tool gets everything you need to.  I have a multiple pet household, and I find this works better on picking up dog hair than my Dyson animal did!  The only thing I don't like is in Alaska I haven't found any place I can buy the vacuum bags locally.  I work around that by ordering them from Amazon!
wow its clean!  This is probably the best appliance I have ever bought (my purple dog  hair Dyson is a very close second) I did not own a carpet cleaner before this and always got Stanley Steamer. They did a good job but scheduling then was difficult as I work unprdictable shifts. My carpets were FILTHY! grey brown, no longer blue. I have a large dog, garage mechanic husband and a lot of in house construction involving wall demo etc. I looked on comsumer reports and they have never rated a carpet cleaner despite continued requests. The CS website reviewers said look on Amazon so I did. I compared many different models and I got the feeling that you get what you pay for. So - People, spend the extra money and get a good one! I read the instructions carefully but it was pretty easy to put together I thought I would spot clean the areas where the dog sleeps and leave it at that. Forget it! the carpet was so clean in those spots I did the whole room. The machine is easy to use, its not too heavy to push around and most important for me, it gets a lot of dog fuzz in the dirty water tank but it does not clog anything up. If you have pets this is a must! I got the pet carpet detergent from Amazon also. The carpet was dry where I started while I was finshing the last part of the room and we don't have a big house. It seems to use a lot of water I had to empty the clean/dirty canisters 4-5 times but never owning one before I am not sure what is normal throughput. I was very unsure of buying a cleaner as a lot of reviewers are not happy with theirs and neither is anyone I talked to at work. I am really happy with my choice and realllllly happy with my carpets. If I use it 3 times It will have paid for itself
This little thing does the job equally same or better than errr say a $300 miele vacuum cleaner  This little thing does the job equally same or better than errr say a $300 miele vacuum cleaner. Get one even if you don't need it as a backup if you need an excuse to buy one. ;)
a good value product  This is the third vacuum of this model that I have bought, this one for my workplace (the other two are still working fine just in other locations). Especially for the price, this model is far more user friendly than the much more expensive one I am replacing at work. The suction is great, it's light weight with a long enough hose to vacuum overhead with having to lift the whole vacuum off the floor. It's easy to change bags, follows you without a struggle. These mighty might vacuums take a beating but keep going strong and hold together, they are amazing. It's the best canister vacuum on the market in my opinion.
Great vacuum for the price  I had previously bought a different vacuum on here for pet hair and was very disappointed.  When I returned it (which btw, is very easy to do with amazon!) I bought this one as a temporary stop gap.  This pulls pet hair right up (I have 2 huskies that shed a lot!) and does its job.  The canister is easy to empty (if you overfill it then youll have to shake it really hard to get stuff stuck in the top of it), the cord seems as long as most vacuums, and the hand tools are OK.  I held off on reviewing it for a while because the plastics seemed really cheap and I fully expected to talk about how something had broken in the review, but Ive used it probably 15 times now and Im convinced itll last...just looks cheap.  If this is how far cheap vacuums have come over the years I will probably just buy a new one of these every 3 or so years and never buy and expensive one again.  So much for just being a temporary vacuum!
Note to Seniors (and anyone else who will listen)  I am 74 years old and I have arthritis.  When my old Hoover lightweight finally kicked, I thought I'd get modern and buy one of those high-end highly touted bagless vacs.  Big mistake.  I realized that once I'd finished vacuuming, I had to spend virtually equal time emptying the cup (dust going everywhere) and washing out the filters.  If I needed to vac again before the filter stuff was dry, that stalled my agenda.  Vacuuming is tedious enough without having to clean the machine extensively as well.  So now I've just bought a Soniclean.  First, assembly.  Okay. Some-assembly-required makes me apprehensive, so I opened the box with trepidation.  Just one screw into one hole with one Allen wrench (provided), with kindergarten-clear instructions.  Yes.  I can do this.  (Fringe benefit: a sense of accomplishment.)  Cleaning: First, the hose is a decent length. I can do the entire main floor of my house with one outlet change.  Second, profile: the low nose on the machine gives it leverage under the beds, kick plates under kitchen and bathroom counters, front edge of the refrigerator and washer, under the couches and heavy chairs.  Third: (probably first, actually), mobility: This vac just glides around and sucks up stuff.  Exactly what I had in mind.  I no longer have to ration my cleaning effort to a single room at a time due to fatigue.  It maneuvers great with minimal direction from the operator.  Fourth, suction: It picked up half a bagful of miscellaneous dog hair and debris the first time I used it.  Doesn't speak well for my gee-whiz bagless, does it?  That one's going to be donated today.  Reliability: I really don't care if this little vac doesn't last the rest of my lifetime.  At this price I'll just replace it.  And get one for the lake cottage as well.  Good product, great solution for me.  Thank you, Soniclean!
Absolutely great!  Sucks up everything my grandson drops and some of the things I DON'T want sucked up!
Bagged canister vacuum that picks up the mess w/out making a mess  No more bag-less nightmare vacuums!  Great, light weigh canister vac.  Seems to pick up hair (people & animal) as well as most debris (including litter & small rocks).  This is one of the best reasons to have a bagged vacuum as it keeps the mess contained!  Has long reach handle & long cord (however it wraps on the bottom for storage).
I love this vacuum cleaner and am beyond pleased with the quality!! It works fabulously on my hardwood floors with great suction!  I definitely would recommend it!

Yikes, there is that much dirt on my floors!  Our entire downstairs is hard surface floors and approximately 30% textured tile that dirt love to get into the texture and the only way to clean is with brushes on your hands and knees...yes, a true Cinderella story.  We purchased this unit and I was skeptical it would work but much to my surprise this thing is amazing...be warned, you may be embarrassed how dirty the pickup tank water is!  The Hoover cleaning solution ads a nice soft shine to the tile floor and does a good job of cleaning.  I use the cleaner approximately once per week and it is slow going and I wish the cleaning head was wider but I don't think there is a better solution.  Several have complained about the size of the clean and dirty tanks but I do not have any issues...you utilize hot tap water for the cleaning tank and as all our mother's have told us hot water cleans best...if the tank was bigger the water temperature would drop to less effective levels before you were able to use it up.  Plus, about the time it is empty and ready to be changed I am ready for a break.
I love this vacuum  I love this vacuum. It works equally well on carpets and floors. Easy to use, easy to change the bag and easy to push. It's very quiet which is also a nice feature.
